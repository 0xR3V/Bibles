n the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
\[2]And the earth was waste and empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
\[3]And God said, Let there be light. And there was light.
\[4]And God saw the light that it was good; and God divided between the light and the darkness.
\[5]And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.
\[6]And God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it be a division between waters and waters.
\[7]And God made the expanse, and divided between the waters that are under the expanse and the waters that are above the expanse; and it was so.
\[8]And God called the expanse Heavens. And there was evening, and there was morning—a second day.
\[9]And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place, and let the dry [land] appear. And it was so.
\[10]And God called the dry [land] Earth, and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
\[11]And God said, Let the earth cause grass to spring up, herb producing seed, fruit-trees yielding fruit after their kind, the seed of which is in them, on the earth. And it was so.
\[12]And the earth brought forth grass, herb producing seed after its kind, and trees yielding fruit, the seed of which is in them, after their kind. And God saw that it was good.
\[13]And there was evening, and there was morning—a third day.
\[14]And God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens, to divide between the day and the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;
\[15]and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens, to give light on the earth. And it was so.
\[16]And God made the two great lights, the great light to rule the day, and the small light to rule the night,—and the stars.
\[17]And God set them in the expanse of the heavens, to give light on the earth,
\[18]and to rule during the day and during the night, and to divide between the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
\[19]And there was evening, and there was morning—a fourth day.
\[20]And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living souls, and let fowl fly above the earth in the expanse of the heavens.
\[21]And God created the great sea monsters, and every living soul that moves with which the waters swarm, after their kind, and every winged fowl after its kind. And God saw that it was good.
\[22]And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply on the earth.
\[23]And there was evening, and there was morning—a fifth day.
\[24]And God said, Let the earth bring forth living souls after their kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth, after their kind. And it was so.
\[25]And God made the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing of the ground after its kind. And God saw that it was good.
\[26]And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over the whole earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth.
\[27]And God created Man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
\[28]And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over every animal that moveth on the earth.
\[29]And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb producing seed that is on the whole earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree producing seed: it shall be food for you;
\[30]and to every animal of the earth, and to every fowl of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth on the earth, in which is a living soul, every green herb for food. And it was so.
\[31]And God saw everything that he had made, and behold it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.

nd the heavens and the earth and all their host were finished.
\[2]And God had finished on the seventh day his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
\[3]And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it, because that on it he rested from all his work which God had created in making it.
\[4]These are the histories of the heavens and the earth, when they were created, in the day that Jehovah Elohim made earth and heavens,
\[5]and every shrub of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew; for Jehovah Elohim had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to till the ground.
\[6]But a mist went up from the earth, and moistened the whole surface of the ground.
\[7]And Jehovah Elohim formed Man, dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and Man became a living soul.
\[8]And Jehovah Elohim planted a garden in Eden eastward, and there put Man whom he had formed.
\[9]And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; and the tree of life, in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
\[10]And a river went out of Eden, to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four main streams.
\[11]The name of the one is Pison: that is it which surrounds the whole land of Havilah, where the gold is.
\[12]And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and the onyx stone are there.
\[13]And the name of the second river is Gihon: that is it which surrounds the whole land of Cush.
\[14]And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which flows forward toward Asshur. And the fourth river, that is Euphrates.
\[15]And Jehovah Elohim took Man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to till it and to guard it.
\[16]And Jehovah Elohim commanded Man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou shalt freely eat;
\[17]but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt certainly die.
\[18]And Jehovah Elohim said, It is not good that Man should be alone; I will make him a helpmate, his like.
\[19]And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim had formed every animal of the field and all fowl of the heavens, and brought [them] to Man, to see what he would call them; and whatever Man called each living soul, that was its name.
\[20]And Man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but as for Adam, he found no helpmate, his like.
\[21]And Jehovah Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon Man; and he slept. And he took one of his ribs and closed up flesh in its stead.
\[22]And Jehovah Elohim built the rib that he had taken from Man into a woman; and brought her to Man.
\[23]And Man said, This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man.
\[24]Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.
\[25]And they were both naked, Man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

nd the serpent was more crafty than any animal of the field which Jehovah Elohim had made. And it said to the woman, Is it even so, that God has said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
\[2]And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;
\[3]but of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, God has said, Ye shall not eat of it, and ye shall not touch it, lest ye die.
\[4]And the serpent said to the woman, Ye will not certainly die;
\[5]but God knows that in the day ye eat of it, your eyes will be opened, and ye will be as God, knowing good and evil.
\[6]And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a pleasure for the eyes, and the tree was to be desired to give intelligence; and she took of its fruit, and ate, and gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.
\[7]And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
\[8]And they heard the voice of Jehovah Elohim, walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah Elohim, in the midst of the trees of the garden.
\[9]And Jehovah Elohim called to Man, and said to him, Where art thou?
\[10]And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I feared, because I am naked; and I hid myself.
\[11]And he said, Who told thee that thou art naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee not to eat?
\[12]And Man said, The woman, whom thou hast given [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.
\[13]And Jehovah Elohim said to the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.
\[14]And Jehovah Elohim said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, be thou cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. On thy belly shalt thou go, and eat dust all the days of thy life.
\[15]And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he shall crush thy head, and thou shalt crush his heel.
\[16]To the woman he said, I will greatly increase thy travail and thy pregnancy; with pain thou shalt bear children; and to thy husband shall be thy desire, and he shall rule over thee.
\[17]And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed be the ground on thy account; with toil shalt thou eat [of] it all the days of thy life;
\[18]and thorns and thistles shall it yield thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.
\[19]In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, until thou return to the ground: for out of it wast thou taken. For dust thou art; and unto dust shalt thou return.
\[20]And Man called his wife's name Eve; because she is the mother of all living.
\[21]And Jehovah Elohim made Adam and his wife coats of skin, and clothed them.
\[22]And Jehovah Elohim said, Behold, Man is become as one of us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he stretch out his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever …!
\[23]Therefore Jehovah Elohim sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
\[24]And he drove out Man; and he set the Cherubim, and the flame of the flashing sword, toward the east of the garden of Eden, to guard the way to the tree of life.

\[2]And she further bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a shepherd, but Cain was a husbandman.
\[3]And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to Jehovah.
\[4]And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat. And Jehovah looked upon Abel, and on his offering;
\[5]and upon Cain, and on his offering, he did not look. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.
\[6]And Jehovah said to Cain, Why art thou angry, and why is thy countenance fallen?
\[7]If thou doest well, will not [thy countenance] look up [with confidence]? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door; and unto thee [shall be] his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
\[8]And Cain spoke to Abel his brother, and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
\[9]And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper?
\[10]And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood is crying to me from the ground.
\[11]And now be thou cursed from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand.
\[12]When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield thee its strength; a wanderer and fugitive shalt thou be on the earth.
\[13]And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is too great to be borne.
\[14]Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the ground, and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a wanderer and fugitive on the earth; and it will come to pass, [that] every one who finds me will slay me.
\[15]And Jehovah said to him, Therefore, whoever slayeth Cain, it shall be revenged sevenfold. And Jehovah set a mark on Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.
\[16]And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, toward the east of Eden.
\[17]And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city; and he called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.
\[18]And to Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael; and Mehujael begot Methushael; and Methushael begot Lemech.
\[19]And Lemech took two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the second, Zillah.
\[20]And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of those who dwell in tents, and [breed] cattle.
\[21]And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of those who handle the harp and pipe.
\[22]And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, the forger of every kind of tool of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah.
\[23]And Lemech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice, Ye wives of Lemech, listen to my speech. For I have slain a man for my wound, and a youth for my bruise.
\[24]If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold; Lemech seventy and seven fold.
\[25]And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: … For God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain has slain him.
\[26]And to Seth, to him also was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah.

\[2]that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair, and took themselves wives of all that they chose.
\[3]And Jehovah said, My Spirit shall not always plead with Man; for he indeed is flesh; but his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.
\[4]In those days were the giants on the earth, and also afterwards, when the sons of God had come in to the daughters of men, and they had borne [children] to them; these were the heroes, who of old were men of renown.
\[5]And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of Man was great on the earth, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart only evil continually.
\[6]And Jehovah repented that he had made Man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart.
\[7]And Jehovah said, I will destroy Man, whom I have created, from the earth—from man to cattle, to creeping things, and to fowl of the heavens; for I repent that I have made them.
\[8]But Noah found favour in the eyes of Jehovah.
\[9]This is the history of Noah. Noah was a just man, perfect amongst his generations: Noah walked with God.
\[10]And Noah begot three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
\[11]And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was full of violence.
\[12]And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted its way on the earth.
\[13]And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me, for the earth is full of violence through them; and behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
\[14]Make thyself an ark of gopher wood: [with] cells shalt thou make the ark; and pitch it inside and outside with pitch.
\[15]And thus shalt thou make it: let the length of the ark be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
\[16]A light shalt thou make to the ark; and to a cubit high shalt thou finish it above. And the door of the ark shalt thou set in its side: [with] a lower, second, and third [story] shalt thou make it.
\[17]For I, behold, I bring a flood of waters on the earth, to destroy all flesh under the heavens in which is the breath of life: everything that is on the earth shall expire.
\[18]But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt go into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
\[19]And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every [sort] shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep [them] alive with thee: they shall be male and female.
\[20]Of fowl after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of each shall go in to thee, to keep [them] alive.
\[21]And take thou of all food that is eaten, and gather [it] to thee, that it may be for food for thee and for them.

\[3]Also of the fowl of the heavens by sevens, male and female; to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth.

\[6]And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was on the earth.
\[7]And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
\[8]Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowl, and of everything that creeps on the ground,
\[9]there came two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God had commanded Noah.
\[10]And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were on the earth.
\[11]In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that same day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
\[12]And the pour of rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights.
\[13]On the same day went Noah, and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;
\[14]they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and all fowl after its kind—every bird of every wing.
\[15]And they went to Noah, into the ark, two and two of all flesh, in which was the breath of life.
\[16]And they that came, came male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him. And Jehovah shut him in.
\[17]And the flood was forty days on the earth. And the waters increased, and bore up the ark; and it was lifted up above the earth.
\[18]And the waters prevailed and increased greatly on the earth; and the ark went on the face of the waters.
\[19]And the waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth; and all the high mountains that are under all the heavens were covered.
\[20]Fifteen cubits upward the waters prevailed; and the mountains were covered.
\[21]And all flesh that moved on the earth expired, fowl as well as cattle, and beasts, and all crawling things which crawl on the earth, and all mankind:
\[22]everything which had in its nostrils the breath of life, of all that was on the dry [land], died.
\[23]And every living being was destroyed that was on the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and fowl of the heavens; and they were destroyed from the earth. And Noah alone remained, and what was with him in the ark.

\[3]And the waters retired from the earth, continually retiring; and in the course of a hundred and fifty days the waters abated.

\[8]And he sent out the dove from him, to see if the waters had become low on the ground.
\[9]But the dove found no resting-place for the sole of her foot, and returned to him into the ark; for the waters were on the whole earth; and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ark.

\[16]Go out of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.
\[17]Bring forth with thee every animal which is with thee, of all flesh, fowl as well as cattle, and all the creeping things which creep on the earth, that they may swarm on the earth, and may be fruitful and multiply on the earth.
\[18]And Noah went out, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him.
\[19]All the animals, all the creeping things, and all the fowl—everything that moves on the earth, after their kinds, went out of the ark.
\[20]And Noah built an altar to Jehovah; and took of every clean animal, and of all clean fowl, and offered up burnt-offerings on the altar.
\[21]And Jehovah smelled the sweet odour. And Jehovah said in his heart, I will no more henceforth curse the ground on account of Man, for the thought of Man's heart is evil from his youth; and I will no more smite every living thing, as I have done.

\[3]And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
\[4]And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
\[5]From these came the distribution of the isles of the nations, according to their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
\[6]And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.
\[7]And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
\[8]And Cush begot Nimrod: he began to be mighty on the earth.
\[9]He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah; therefore it is said, As Nimrod, the mighty hunter before Jehovah!
\[10]And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
\[11]From that land went out Asshur, and built Nineveh, and Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah,
\[12]and Resen, between Nineveh and Calah: this is the great city.
\[13]—And Mizraim begot the Ludim, and the Anamim, and the Lehabim, and the Naphtuhim,
\[14]and the Pathrusim, and the Casluhim, out of whom came the Philistines, and the Caphtorim.
\[15]—And Canaan begot Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth,
\[16]and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,
\[17]and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
\[18]and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. And afterwards the families of the Canaanites spread themselves abroad.
\[19]And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as one goes to Gerar, up to Gazah; as one goes to Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, up to Lesha.
\[20]These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.
\[21]And to Shem—to him also were [sons] born; he is the father of all the sons of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder.
\[22]The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.
\[23]And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
\[24]—And Arphaxad begot Shelah; and Shelah begot Eber.
\[25]And to Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.
\[26]And Joktan begot Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
\[27]and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
\[28]and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
\[29]and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were sons of Joktan.

\[4]And they said, Come on, let us build ourselves a city and a tower, the top of which [may reach] to the heavens; and let us make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered over the face of the whole earth.
\[5]And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men built.
\[6]And Jehovah said, Behold, the people is one, and have all one language; and this have they begun to do. And now will they be hindered in nothing that they meditate doing.
\[7]Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.
\[8]And Jehovah scattered them thence over the face of the whole earth. And they left off building the city.
\[9]Therefore was its name called Babel; because Jehovah there confounded the language of the whole earth. And Jehovah scattered them thence over the face of the whole earth.

\[26]And Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
\[27]And these are the generations of Terah: Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begot Lot.
\[28]And Haran died before the face of his father Terah in the land of his nativity at Ur of the Chaldeans.
\[29]And Abram and Nahor took wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, a daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah.
\[30]And Sarai was barren: she had no child.
\[31]And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth together out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan, and came as far as Haran, and dwelt there.

\[3]And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee; and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

\[6]And Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
\[7]And Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land. And there he built an altar to Jehovah who had appeared to him.
\[8]And he removed thence towards the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, [having] Bethel toward the west, and Ai toward the east; and there he built an altar to Jehovah, and called on the name of Jehovah.
\[9]And Abram moved onward, going on still toward the south.
\[10]And there was a famine in the land. And Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was grievous in the land.

\[12]And it will come to pass when the Egyptians see thee, that they will say, She is his wife; and they will slay me, and save thee alive.
\[13]Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister, that it may be well with me on thy account, and my soul may live because of thee.
\[14]And it came to pass when Abram came into Egypt, that the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
\[15]And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
\[16]And he treated Abram well on her account; and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and bondmen, and bondwomen, and she-asses, and camels.

\[18]And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this thou hast done to me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
\[19]Why didst thou say, She is my sister, so that I took her as my wife. And now, behold, there is thy wife: take [her], and go away.

\[3]And he went on his journeys from the south as far as Bethel; as far as the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai;
\[4]to the place of the altar that he had made there at the first. And there Abram called on the name of Jehovah.
\[5]And Lot also who went with Abram had flocks, and herds, and tents.
\[6]And the land could not support them, that they might dwell together, for their property was great; and they could not dwell together.
\[7]And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle. And the Canaanite and the Perizzite were dwelling then in the land.
\[8]And Abram said to Lot, I pray thee let there be no contention between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen, for we are brethren.
\[9]Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if to the left, then I will take the right; and if to the right, then I will take the left.
\[10]And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of the Jordan that it was thoroughly watered, before Jehovah had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah; as the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as one goes to Zoar.
\[11]And Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan; and Lot went toward the east. And they separated the one from the other:
\[12]Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan; and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched tents as far as Sodom.
\[13]And the people of Sodom were wicked, and great sinners before Jehovah.
\[14]And Jehovah said to Abram, after that Lot had separated himself from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward;
\[15]for all the land that thou seest will I give to thee, and to thy seed for ever.
\[16]And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, so that if any one can number the dust of the earth, thy seed also will be numbered.
\[17]Arise, walk through the land according to the length of it and according to the breadth of it; for I will give it to thee.

\[28]Perhaps there may want five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city on account of the five? And he said, If I shall find forty-five there, I will not destroy [it].
\[29]And he continued yet to speak with him, and said, Perhaps there may be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake.
\[30]And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry that I speak! Perhaps there may be thirty found there. And he said, I will not do it if I find thirty there.
\[31]And he said, Behold now, I have ventured to speak with the Lord. Perhaps there may be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for the twenty's sake.
\[32]And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, that I speak yet but this time! Perhaps there may be ten found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for the ten's sake.

nd the two angels came to Sodom at even. And Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. And Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he bowed down, the face toward the ground,
\[2]and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and lodge, and wash your feet; and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, No; but we will pass the night in the open place.
\[3]And he urged them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house. And he made them a repast, and baked unleavened cakes; and they ate.
\[4]Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, from the youngest to the oldest—all the people from every quarter.
\[5]And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men that have come in to thee to-night? bring them out to us that we may know them.
\[6]And Lot went out to them to the entrance, and shut the door after him,
\[7]and said, I pray you, my brethren, do not wickedly!
\[8]Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known a man: let me now bring them out to you; and do to them as is good in your sight: only, to these men do nothing; for therefore have they come under the shadow of my roof.
\[9]And they said, Back there! And they said [again], This one came to sojourn, and he must be a judge? Now we will deal worse with thee than with them. And they pressed hard on the man—on Lot; and drew near to break the door.
\[10]And the men stretched out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.
\[11]And they smote the men that were at the entrance of the house with blindness, from the smallest to the greatest; and they wearied themselves to find the entrance.
\[12]And the men said to Lot, Whom hast thou here besides? a son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and all whom thou hast in the city—bring [them] out of the place.
\[13]For we are going to destroy this place, because the cry of them is great before Jehovah, and Jehovah has sent us to destroy it.
\[14]And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who had married his daughters, and said, Up, go out of this place, for Jehovah will destroy the city. But he was as if he jested, in the sight of his sons-in-law.
\[15]And as the dawn arose, the angels urged Lot, saying, Up, take thy wife and thy two daughters who are present, lest thou perish in the iniquity of the city.
\[16]And as he lingered, the men laid hold on his hand, and on the hand of his wife, and on the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful to him; and they led him out, and set him without the city.
\[17]And it came to pass when they had brought them outside, that he said, Escape for thy life: look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain: escape to the mountain, lest thou perish.
\[18]And Lot said to them, Not [so], I pray thee, Lord;
\[19]behold now, thy servant has found favour in thine eyes, and thou hast magnified thy goodness, which thou hast shewn to me in preserving my soul alive; but I cannot escape to the mountain, lest calamity lay hold on me, that I die.
\[20]Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is small: I pray thee, let me escape thither—is it not small?—and my soul shall live.
\[21]And he said to him, Behold, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken.
\[22]Haste, escape thither; for I cannot do anything until thou art come there. Therefore the name of the city is called Zoar.
\[23]The sun rose upon the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
\[24]And Jehovah rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven,
\[25]and overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew upon the ground.
\[26]And his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
\[27]And Abraham rose early in the morning [and went] to the place where he had stood before Jehovah;
\[28]and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo, a smoke went up from the land as the smoke of a furnace.
\[29]And it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.
\[30]And Lot went up from Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar. And he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
\[31]And the first-born said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the land to come in to us after the manner of all the earth:
\[32]come, let us give our father wine to drink, and let us lie with him, that we may preserve seed alive of our father.
\[33]And they gave their father wine to drink that night. And the first-born went in, and lay with her father, and he did not know of her lying down, nor of her rising.
\[34]And it came to pass on the next day that the first-born said to the younger, Lo, I lay last night with my father: let us give him wine to drink to-night also, and go thou in, lie with him, that we may preserve seed alive of our father.
\[35]And they gave their father wine to drink that night also. And the younger arose, and lay with him; and he did not know of her lying down, nor of her rising.
\[36]And both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father.
\[37]And the first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites to this day.
\[38]And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi; the same is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.

\[3]But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art [but] a dead man, because of the woman that thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.
\[4]But Abimelech had not come near her. And he said, Lord, wilt thou also kill a righteous nation?
\[5]Did he not say to me, She is my sister? and she, even she said, He is my brother. In the integrity of my heart and in the innocency of my hands have I done this.
\[6]And God said to him in a dream, I also knew that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart, and I, too, have withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore have I not suffered thee to touch her.
\[7]And now, restore the man's wife; for he is a prophet, and will pray for thee, that thou mayest live. And if thou do not restore [her], know that thou shalt certainly die, thou and all that is thine.
\[8]And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and spoke all these words in their ears; and the men were greatly afraid.
\[9]And Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, What hast thou done to us? And in what have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me, and on my kingdom, a great sin? Thou hast done to me deeds that ought not to be done.
\[10]And Abimelech said to Abraham, What hast thou seen that thou hast done this?
\[11]And Abraham said, Because I said, Surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they will kill me for my wife's sake.
\[12]But she is also truly my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
\[13]And it came to pass when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, Let this be thy kindness which thou shalt shew to me: at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
\[14]And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and bondmen and bondwomen, and gave [them] to Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.
\[15]And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it is good in thine eyes.
\[16]And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand [pieces] of silver; behold, let that be to thee a covering of the eyes, in respect of all that are with thee, and with all; and she was reproved.
\[17]And Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and his wife and his handmaids, and they bore [children].

\[2]And Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him.
\[3]And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
\[4]And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
\[5]And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
\[6]And Sarah said, God has made me laugh: all that hear will laugh with me.
\[7]And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, Sarah will suckle children? For I have borne [him] a son in his old age.
\[8]And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
\[9]And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.
\[10]And she said to Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son; for the son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son—with Isaac.
\[11]And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.
\[12]And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy handmaid: [in] all that Sarah hath said to thee hearken to her voice, for in Isaac shall a seed be called to thee.
\[13]But also the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.
\[14]And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a flask of water, and gave [it] to Hagar, putting [it] on her shoulder—and the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
\[15]And the water was exhausted from the flask; and she cast the child under one of the shrubs,
\[16]and she went and sat down over against [him], a bow-shot off; for she said, Let me not behold the death of the child. And she sat over against [him], and lifted up her voice and wept.
\[17]And God heard the voice of the lad. And the Angel of God called to Hagar from the heavens, and said to her, What [aileth] thee, Hagar? Fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad there, where he is.
\[18]Arise, take the lad, and hold him in thy hand; for I will make of him a great nation.
\[19]And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the flask with water, and gave the lad drink.
\[20]And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
\[21]And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
\[22]And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech, and Phichol the captain of his host, spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest.
\[23]And now swear to me here by God that thou wilt not deal deceitfully with me, nor with my son, nor with my grandson. According to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land in which thou sojournest.
\[24]And Abraham said, I will swear.
\[25]And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water that Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
\[26]And Abimelech said, I do not know who has done this, neither hast thou told me [of it], neither have I heard [of it] but to-day.
\[27]And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.
\[28]And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves.
\[29]And Abimelech said to Abraham, What [mean] these seven ewe-lambs, these which thou hast set by themselves?
\[30]And he said, That thou take the seven ewe-lambs of my hand, that they may be a witness to me that I have dug this well.
\[31]Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba, because there they had sworn, both of them.
\[32]And they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. And Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the captain of his host, and returned into the land of the Philistines.
\[33]And [Abraham] planted a tamarisk in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of Jehovah, the Eternal God.

\[3]And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up and went to the place that God had told him of.
\[4]On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar.
\[5]And Abraham said to his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
\[6]And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and the knife, and they went both of them together.
\[7]And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father! And he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the sheep for a burnt-offering?
\[8]And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself with the sheep for a burnt-offering. And they went both of them together.
\[9]And they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built the altar there, and piled the wood; and he bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
\[10]And Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to slaughter his son.
\[11]And the Angel of Jehovah called to him from the heavens, and said, Abraham, Abraham! And he said, Here am I.
\[12]And he said, Stretch not out thy hand against the lad, neither do anything to him; for now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only [son], from me.
\[13]And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind was a ram caught in the thicket by its horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt-offering instead of his son.
\[14]And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh; as it is said at the present day, On the mount of Jehovah will be provided.
\[15]And the Angel of Jehovah called to Abraham from the heavens a second time,
\[16]and said, By myself I swear, saith Jehovah, that, because thou hast done this, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only [son],
\[17]I will richly bless thee, and greatly multiply thy seed, as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is on the sea-shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
\[18]and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves, because thou hast hearkened to my voice.

\[3]And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,
\[4]I am a stranger and a sojourner with you; give me a possession of a sepulchre with you, that I may bury my dead from before me.
\[5]And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,
\[6]Hear us, my lord: thou art a prince of God among us: in the choicest of our sepulchres bury thy dead: none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre for burying thy dead.
\[7]And Abraham rose up, and bowed down to the people of the land, to the sons of Heth,
\[8]and spoke to them, saying, If it be your will that I should bury my dead from before me, hear me, and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar,
\[9]that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which is his, which is at the end of his field; for the full money let him give it to me amongst you for a possession of a sepulchre.
\[10]And Ephron was dwelling among the sons of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham, in the ears of the sons of Heth, [even] of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,
\[11]No, my lord: hear me. The field give I thee; and the cave that is in it, to thee I give it; before the eyes of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
\[12]And Abraham bowed down before the people of the land;
\[13]and he spoke to Ephron, in the ears of the people of the land, saying, But if only thou wouldst listen to me, I give the money for the field: take [it] of me, and I will bury my dead there.
\[14]And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
\[15]My lord, hearken to me. A field of four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
\[16]And Abraham hearkened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the money that he had named in the ears of the sons of Heth—four hundred shekels of silver, current with the merchant.
\[17]So the field of Ephron, which was at Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave that was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all its borders round about,
\[18]were assured to Abraham for a possession before the eyes of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
\[19]And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field at Machpelah, opposite to Mamre: that is Hebron, in the land of Canaan.

\[3]and I will make thee swear by Jehovah, the God of the heavens and the God of the earth, that thou take not a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am dwelling;
\[4]but thou shalt go to my land and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.
\[5]And the servant said to him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land: must I, then, bring thy son again in any case to the land from which thou hast removed?
\[6]And Abraham said to him, Beware that thou bring not my son thither again.
\[7]Jehovah the God of the heavens, who took me out of my father's house, and out of the land of my nativity, and who has spoken to me, and who has sworn to me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land—he will send his angel before thee, that thou mayest take a wife for my son thence.
\[8]And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be quit of this my oath: only, bring not my son thither again.
\[9]And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore unto him concerning that matter.
\[10]And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; now all the treasure of his master was under his hand; and he arose and went to Aram-naharaim, to the city of Nahor.
\[11]And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by a well of water, at the time of the evening, when the women came out to draw [water].
\[12]And he said, Jehovah, God of my master Abraham, meet me, I pray thee, [with thy blessing] this day, and deal kindly with my master Abraham.
\[13]Behold, I stand [here] by the well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water.
\[14]And let it come to pass, [that] the maiden to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink, and who will say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also, be she whom thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and hereby I shall know that thou hast dealt kindly with my master.
\[15]And it came to pass before he had ended speaking, that behold, Rebecca came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother; and [she had] her pitcher upon her shoulder.
\[16]And the maiden was very fair in countenance; a virgin, and no man had known her. And she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
\[17]And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, sip a little water out of thy pitcher.
\[18]And she said, Drink, my lord! And she hasted and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink.
\[19]And when she had given him enough to drink, she said, I will draw [water] for thy camels also, until they have drunk enough.
\[20]And she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw [water]; and she drew for all his camels.
\[21]And the man was astonished at her, remaining silent, to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not.
\[22]And it came to pass when the camels had drunk enough, that the man took a gold ring, of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands, ten [shekels] weight of gold,
\[23]and said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee. Is there room [in] thy father's house for us to lodge?
\[24]And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.
\[25]And she said to him, There is straw, and also much provender with us; also room to lodge.
\[26]And the man stooped, and bowed down before Jehovah,
\[27]and said, Blessed be Jehovah, God of my master Abraham, who has not withdrawn his loving-kindness and his faithfulness from my master; I being in the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of my master's brethren.
\[28]And the maiden ran and told these things to her mother's house.
\[29]And Rebecca had a brother, named Laban; and Laban ran out to the man, to the well.
\[30]And it came to pass when he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister's hand, and when he heard the words of Rebecca his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me—that he came to the man, and behold, he was standing by the camels, by the well.
\[31]And he said, Come in, blessed of Jehovah! why standest thou outside? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
\[32]And the man came into the house; and he ungirded the camels, and gave the camels straw and provender, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men who were with him.
\[33]And there was set [meat] before him to eat; but he said, I will not eat until I have made known my business. And he said, Speak on.
\[34]And he said, I am Abraham's servant.
\[35]And Jehovah has blessed my master greatly, and he is become great; and he has given him sheep and cattle, and silver and gold, and bondmen and bondwomen, and camels and asses.
\[36]And Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master after she had grown old; and unto him has he given all that he has.

\[38]but thou shalt by all means go to my father's house and to my family, and take a wife for my son.
\[39]And I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow me?
\[40]And he said to me, Jehovah, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way, that thou mayest take a wife for my son of my family, and out of my father's house.
\[41]Then shalt thou be quit of my oath, when thou shalt have come to my family. And if they give thee not [one], thou shalt be quit of my oath.
\[42]And I came this day to the well, and said, Jehovah, God of my master Abraham, if now thou wilt prosper my way on which I go,
\[43]behold, I stand by the well of water, and let it come to pass that the damsel who cometh forth to draw [water], and to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water out of thy pitcher to drink,
\[44]and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels—that she should be the woman whom Jehovah hath appointed for my master's son.
\[45]Before I ended speaking in my heart, behold, Rebecca came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder, and went down to the well, and drew [water]; and I said to her, Give me, I pray thee, to drink.
\[46]And she hasted and let down her pitcher from her [shoulder], and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. And I drank; and she gave the camels drink also.
\[47]And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him. And I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.
\[48]And I stooped, and bowed down before Jehovah; and I blessed Jehovah, God of my master Abraham, who has led me the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son.
\[49]And now, if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me; and I will turn to the right hand or to the left.
\[50]And Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from Jehovah: we cannot speak to thee bad or good.
\[51]Behold, Rebecca is before thee: take [her], and go away; and let her be wife of thy master's son, as Jehovah has said.
\[52]And it came to pass, when Abraham's servant heard their words, that he bowed down to the earth before Jehovah.
\[53]And the servant brought forth silver articles, and gold articles, and clothing, and he gave [them] to Rebecca; and he gave to her brother, and to her mother, precious things.
\[54]And they ate and drank, he and the men that were with him, and lodged. And they rose up in the morning; and he said, Send me away to my master.
\[55]And her brother and her mother said, Let the maiden abide with us [some] days, or [say] ten; after that she shall go.
\[56]And he said to them, Do not hinder me, seeing Jehovah has prospered my way: send me away, and I will go to my master.
\[57]And they said, Let us call the maiden and inquire at her mouth.
\[58]And they called Rebecca and said to her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
\[59]And they sent away Rebecca their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.
\[60]And they blessed Rebecca, and said to her, Thou art our sister; mayest thou become thousands of tens of thousands; and may thy seed possess the gate of their enemies!
\[61]And Rebecca arose, and her maids, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebecca, and went away.
\[62]And Isaac had just returned from Beer-lahai-roi; for he was dwelling in the south country.

\[64]And Rebecca lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac, and she sprang off the camel.
\[65]And she had said to the servant, Who is the man that is walking in the fields to meet us? And the servant said, That is my master! Then she took the veil, and covered herself.
\[66]And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
\[67]And Isaac led her into his mother Sarah's tent; and he took Rebecca, and she became his wife, and he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after [the death of] his mother.

nd Abraham took another wife named Keturah.
\[2]And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
\[3]And Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan; and the sons of Dedan were the Asshurim, and the Letushim, and the Leummim.
\[4]And the sons of Midian were Ephah, and Epher, and Enoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were sons of Keturah.
\[5]And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.
\[6]And to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and, while he yet lived, sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward to the east country.
\[7]And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived: a hundred and seventy-five years.
\[8]And Abraham expired and died in a good old age, old and full [of days]; and was gathered to his peoples.
\[9]And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which was opposite to Mamre—
\[10]the field that Abraham had purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
\[11]And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac dwelt at Beer-lahai-roi.
\[12]And these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's bondwoman, bore to Abraham.
\[13]And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael by their names according to their generations: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
\[14]and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
\[15]Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedmah.
\[16]These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, in their hamlets and their encampments—twelve princes of their peoples.
\[17]And these are the years of the life of Ishmael: a hundred and thirty-seven years; and he expired and died, and was gathered to his peoples.
\[18]And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, which is opposite to Egypt, as one goes towards Assyria. He settled before the face of all his brethren.
\[19]And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham begot Isaac.
\[20]And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebecca as wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian.
\[21]And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren; and Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebecca his wife conceived.
\[22]And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If [it be] so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of Jehovah.
\[23]And Jehovah said to her, Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels; And one people shall be stronger than the other people, And the elder shall serve the younger.
\[24]And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
\[25]And the first came out red—all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
\[26]And after that came his brother out; and his hand took hold of Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.
\[27]And the boys grew, and Esau became a man skilled in hunting, a man of the field; and Jacob was a homely man, dwelling in tents.
\[28]And Isaac loved Esau, because venison was to his taste; and Rebecca loved Jacob.
\[29]And Jacob had cooked a dish; and Esau came from the field, and he was faint.
\[30]And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with the red—the red thing there, for I am faint. Therefore was his name called Edom.
\[31]And Jacob said, Sell me now thy birthright.
\[32]And Esau said, Behold, I am going to die, and of what use can the birthright be to me?
\[33]And Jacob said, Swear unto me now. And he swore unto him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.
\[34]And Jacob gave Esau bread and the dish of lentils; and he ate and drank, and rose up and went away. Thus Esau despised the birthright.

nd there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine which had been in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech the king of the Philistines, to Gerar.
\[2]And Jehovah appeared to him and said, Go not down to Egypt: dwell in the land that I shall tell thee of.
\[3]Sojourn in this land; and I will be with thee and bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries; and I will perform the oath which I swore unto Abraham thy father.
\[4]And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and unto thy seed will I give all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves—
\[5]because that Abraham hearkened to my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
\[6]And Isaac dwelt at Gerar.
\[7]And the men of the place asked about his wife. And he said, She is my sister; for he feared to say, my wife, [saying to himself,] Lest the men of the place slay me on account of Rebecca—because she was fair in countenance.
\[8]And it came to pass when he had been there some time, that Abimelech the king of the Philistines looked out of the window, and saw, and behold, Isaac was dallying with Rebecca his wife.
\[9]Then Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, she is certainly thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? and Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I die on account of her.
\[10]And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done to us? But a little and one of the people might have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought a trespass on us.
\[11]And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that touches this man or his wife shall certainly be put to death.
\[12]And Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundredfold; and Jehovah blessed him.
\[13]And the man became great, and he became continually greater, until he was very great.
\[14]And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great number of servants; and the Philistines envied him.
\[15]And all the wells that his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped them and filled them with earth.
\[16]And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us; for thou art become much mightier than we.
\[17]And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his camp in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
\[18]And Isaac dug again the wells of water that they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and that the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham; and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
\[19]And Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
\[20]But the shepherds of Gerar strove with Isaac's shepherds, saying, The water is ours. And he called the name of the well Esek, because they had quarrelled with him.
\[21]And they dug another well, and they strove for that also; and he called the name of it Sitnah.
\[22]And he removed thence and dug another well; and they did not strive for that. And he called the name of it Rehoboth, and said, For now Jehovah has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
\[23]And he went up thence to Beer-sheba.
\[24]And Jehovah appeared to him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.
\[25]And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah. And he pitched his tent there; and there Isaac's servants dug a well.
\[26]And Abimelech, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phichol the captain of his host, went to him from Gerar.
\[27]And Isaac said to them, Why are ye come to me, seeing ye hate me, and have driven me away from you?
\[28]And they said, We saw certainly that Jehovah is with thee; and we said, Let there be then an oath between us—between us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee,
\[29]that thou wilt do us no wrong, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done to thee nothing but good, and have let thee go in peace; thou art now blessed of Jehovah.
\[30]And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
\[31]And they rose early in the morning, and swore one to another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
\[32]And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well that they had dug, and said to him, We have found water.
\[33]And he called it Shebah; therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.
\[34]And Esau was forty years old, when he took as wives Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basmath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.

\[2]And he said, Behold now, I am become old; I know not the day of my death.
\[3]And now, I pray thee, take thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field and hunt me venison,
\[4]and prepare me a savoury dish such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, in order that my soul may bless thee before I die.
\[5]And Rebecca heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt venison, to bring it.
\[6]And Rebecca spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak to Esau thy brother, saying,
\[7]Bring me venison, and prepare me a savoury dish, that I may eat, and bless thee before Jehovah, before my death.
\[8]And now, my son, hearken to my voice in that which I command thee.
\[9]Go, I pray thee, to the flock, and fetch me thence two good kids of the goats. And I will make of them a savoury dish for thy father, such as he loves.
\[10]And thou shalt bring [it] to thy father, that he may eat, in order that he may bless thee before his death.
\[11]And Jacob said to Rebecca his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
\[12]My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall be in his sight as one who mocks [him], and I shall bring a curse on me, and not a blessing.
\[13]And his mother said to him, On me [be] thy curse, my son! Only hearken to my voice, and go, fetch [them].
\[14]And he went, and fetched and brought [them] to his mother. And his mother prepared a savoury dish such as his father loved.
\[15]And Rebecca took the clothes of her elder son Esau, the costly ones which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son;
\[16]and she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck;
\[17]and she gave the savoury dishes and the bread that she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob.
\[18]And he came to his father, and said, My father! And he said, Here am I: who art thou, my son?
\[19]And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau, thy firstborn. I have done according as thou didst say to me. Arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, in order that thy soul may bless me.
\[20]And Isaac said to his son, How is it that thou hast found [it] so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah thy God put [it] in my way.
\[21]And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be really my son Esau or not.
\[22]And Jacob drew near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
\[23]And he did not discern him, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands; and he blessed him.
\[24]And he said, Art thou really my son Esau? And he said, It is I.
\[25]And he said, Bring [it] near to me, that I may eat of my son's venison, in order that my soul may bless thee. And he brought [it] near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.
\[26]And his father Isaac said to him, Come near, now, and kiss me, my son.
\[27]And he came near, and kissed him. And he smelt the smell of his clothes, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed.
\[28]And God give thee of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness of the earth, And plenty of corn and new wine.
\[29]Let peoples serve thee, And races bow down to thee. Be lord over thy brethren, And let thy mother's sons bow down to thee. Cursed be they that curse thee, And blessed be they that bless thee.
\[30]And it came to pass when Isaac had ended blessing Jacob, and when Jacob was only just gone out from Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came from his hunting.
\[31]And he also had prepared savoury dishes, and he brought [them] in to his father, and said to his father, Let my father arise and eat of his son's venison, in order that thy soul may bless me.
\[32]And Isaac his father said to him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn, Esau.
\[33]Then Isaac trembled with exceeding great trembling, and said, Who was he, then, that hunted venison and brought [it] to me? And I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him; also blessed he shall be.
\[34]When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me—me also, my father!
\[35]And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and has taken away thy blessing.
\[36]And he said, Is it not therefore he was named Jacob, for he has supplanted me now twice? He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
\[37]And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him lord over thee, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants, and with corn and new wine have I supplied him—and what can I do now for thee, my son?
\[38]And Esau said to his father, Hast thou then but one blessing, my father? bless me—me also, my father! And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.
\[39]And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth, And of the dew of heaven from above;
\[40]And by thy sword shalt thou live; And thou shalt serve thy brother; And it shall come to pass when thou rovest about, That thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.
\[41]And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand, and I will slay my brother Jacob.
\[42]And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebecca. And she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, comforts himself that he will kill thee.
\[43]And now, my son, hearken to my voice, and arise, flee to Laban my brother, to Haran;
\[44]and abide with him some days, until thy brother's fury turn away—
\[45]until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget what thou hast done to him; then I will send and fetch thee thence. Why should I be bereaved even of you both in one day?
\[46]And Rebecca said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good should my life do me?

\[4]And may he give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee and to thy seed with thee, in order that thou mayest possess the land of thy sojourning, which God gave to Abraham!
\[5]And Isaac sent away Jacob; and he went to Padan-Aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebecca, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
\[6]And Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-Aram, to take a wife thence, blessing him, and giving him a charge saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;

\[10]And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went towards Haran.
\[11]And he lighted on a certain place, and lodged there, because the sun had set. And he took [one] of the stones of the place, and made [it] his pillow, and lay down in that place.
\[12]And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to the heavens. And behold, angels of God ascended and descended upon it.
\[13]And behold, Jehovah stood above it. And he said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham, thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land on which thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.
\[14]And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south; and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
\[15]And behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all [places] to which thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee until I have done what I have spoken to thee of.
\[16]And Jacob awoke from his sleep, and said, Surely Jehovah is in this place, and I knew [it] not.
\[17]And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
\[18]And Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had made his pillow, and set it up [for] a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.
\[19]And he called the name of that place Beth-el; but the name of that city was Luz at the first.
\[20]And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and keep me on this road that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and a garment to put on,
\[21]and I come again to my father's house in peace—then shall Jehovah be my God.

\[3]And when all the flocks were gathered there, they rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the mouth of the well in its place.
\[4]And Jacob said to them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.
\[5]And he said to them, Do ye know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We do know [him].
\[6]And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, [He is] well; and behold, there comes Rachel his daughter with the sheep.
\[7]And he said, Behold, it is yet high day; it is not time that the cattle should be gathered together; water the sheep, and go, feed [them].
\[8]And they said, We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well, and we water the sheep.
\[9]While he was still speaking to them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
\[10]And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep of Laban his mother's brother.

\[19]And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.
\[20]And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they were in his eyes as single days, because he loved her.

\[25]And it came to pass in the morning, that behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done to me? Have I not served thee for Rachel? Why then hast thou deceived me?
\[26]And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.
\[27]Fulfil the week [with] this one: then we will give thee the other one also, for the service that thou shalt serve me yet seven other years.

\[26]Give [me] my wives for whom I have served thee, and my children; that I may go away, for thou knowest my service which I have served thee.
\[27]And Laban said to him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes—I have discovered that Jehovah has blessed me for thy sake.
\[28]And he said, Appoint to me thy wages, and I will give it.

\[32]I will pass through all thy flock to-day, to remove thence all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all the brown lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and [that] shall be my hire.
\[33]And my righteousness shall answer for me hereafter, when thou comest about my hire, before thy face: all that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the lambs, let that be stolen with me.
\[34]And Laban said, Well, let it be according to thy word.
\[35]And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the brown among the lambs, and gave [them] into the hand of his sons.
\[36]And he put three days' journey between himself and Jacob. And Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flock.
\[37]And Jacob took fresh rods of white poplar, almond-tree, and maple; and peeled off white stripes in them, uncovering the white which was on the rods.
\[38]And he set the rods which he had peeled before the flock, in the troughs at the watering-places where the flock came to drink, and they were ardent when they came to drink.
\[39]And the flock was ardent before the rods; and the flock brought forth ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.
\[40]And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flock toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he made himself separate flocks, and did not put them with Laban's flock.
\[41]And it came to pass whensoever the strong cattle were ardent, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might become ardent among the rods;
\[42]but when the sheep were feeble, he put [them] not in; so the feeble were Laban's, and the strong Jacob's.

\[2]And Jacob saw the countenance of Laban, and behold, it was not toward him as previously.
\[3]And Jehovah said to Jacob, Return into the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
\[4]And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the fields to his flock,
\[5]and said to them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as previously; but the God of my father has been with me.
\[6]And you know that with all my power I have served your father.
\[7]And your father has mocked me, and has changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.
\[8]If he said thus; The speckled shall be thy hire, then all the flocks bore speckled; and if he said thus: The ringstraked shall be thy hire, then all the flocks bore ringstraked.
\[9]And God has taken away the cattle of your father, and given [them] to me.
\[10]And it came to pass at the time of the ardour of the flocks, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams that leaped upon the flocks were ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.
\[11]And the Angel of God said to me in a dream, Jacob! And I said, Here am I.
\[12]And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see: all the rams that leap upon the flock are ringstraked, speckled, and spotted; for I have seen all that Laban does to thee.
\[13]I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, where thou vowedst a vow to me. Now arise, depart out of this land, and return to the land of thy kindred.
\[14]And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
\[15]Are we not reckoned of him strangers? for he has sold us, and has even constantly devoured our money.
\[16]For all the wealth that God has taken from our father is ours and our children's; and now whatever God has said to thee do.
\[17]And Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels,
\[18]and carried away all his cattle, and all his property that he had acquired—the cattle of his possessions that he had acquired in Padan-Aram, to go to Isaac his father, into the land of Canaan.
\[19]And Laban had gone to shear his sheep. And Rachel stole the teraphim that [belonged] to her father.
\[20]And Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he did not tell him that he fled.
\[21]And he fled with all that he had; and he rose up and passed over the river, and set his face [toward] mount Gilead.
\[22]And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.
\[23]And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey, and overtook him on mount Gilead.
\[24]And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said to him, Take care thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
\[25]And Laban came up with Jacob; and Jacob had pitched his tent on the mountain; Laban also with his brethren pitched on mount Gilead.
\[26]And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast deceived me, and hast carried away my daughters as captives of war?
\[27]Why didst thou flee away covertly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have conducted thee with mirth and with songs, with tambour and with harp;
\[28]and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now thou hast acted foolishly.
\[29]It would be in the power of my hand to do you hurt; but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Take care that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
\[30]And now that thou must needs be gone, because thou greatly longedst after thy father's house, why hast thou stolen my gods?
\[31]And Jacob answered and said to Laban, I was afraid; for I said, Lest thou shouldest take by force thy daughters from me.
\[32]With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live. Before our brethren discern what is thine with me, and take [it] to thee. But Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.
\[33]And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two handmaids' tents, and found nothing; and he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
\[34]Now Rachel had taken the teraphim and put them under the camel's saddle; and she sat upon them. And Laban explored all the tent, but found nothing.
\[35]And she said to her father, Let it not be an occasion of anger in the eyes of my lord that I cannot rise up before thee, for it is with me after the manner of women. And he searched carefully, but did not find the teraphim.
\[36]And Jacob was angry, and he disputed with Laban. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my fault, what my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
\[37]Whereas thou hast explored all my baggage, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set [it] here before my brethren and thy brethren, and let them decide between us both.
\[38]These twenty years have I been with thee: thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock I have not eaten.
\[39]What was torn I have not brought to thee; I had to bear the loss of it: of my hand hast thou required it, [whether] stolen by day or stolen by night.
\[40]Thus it was with me: in the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes.
\[41]I have been these twenty years in thy house: I have served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock; and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
\[42]Had not the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, been with me, it is certain thou wouldest have sent me away now empty. God has looked upon my affliction and the labour of my hands, and has judged last night.
\[43]And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the flock is my flock, and all that thou seest is mine; but as for my daughters, what can I do this day to them, or to their sons whom they have brought forth?
\[44]And now, come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be a witness between me and thee.
\[45]And Jacob took a stone, and set it up [for] a pillar.
\[46]And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones. And they took stones, and made a heap, and ate there upon the heap.
\[47]And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed.
\[48]And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed,
\[49]—and Mizpah; for he said, Let Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we shall be hidden one from another:
\[50]if thou shouldest afflict my daughters, or if thou shouldest take wives besides my daughters,—no man is with us; see, God is witness between me and thee!
\[51]And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar which I have set up between me and thee:
\[52][let] this heap be witness, and the pillar a witness, that neither I pass this heap [to go] to thee, nor thou pass this heap and this pillar [to come] to me, for harm.
\[53]The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us! And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.
\[54]And Jacob offered a sacrifice upon the mountain, and invited his brethren to eat bread: and they ate bread, and lodged on the mountain.
\[55]And Laban rose early in the morning, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them; and Laban went and returned to his place.

\[2]And when Jacob saw them he said, This is the camp of God. And he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
\[3]And Jacob sent messengers before his face to Esau his brother, into the land of Seir, the fields of Edom.
\[4]And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak to my lord, to Esau: Thy servant Jacob speaks thus—With Laban have I sojourned and tarried until now;
\[5]and I have oxen, and asses, sheep, and bondmen, and bondwomen; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favour in thine eyes.
\[6]And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother, to Esau; and he also is coming to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
\[7]Then Jacob was greatly afraid, and was distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the sheep and the cattle and the camels, into two troops.
\[8]And he said, If Esau come to the one troop and smite it, then the other troop which is left shall escape.
\[9]And Jacob said, God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Jehovah, who saidst unto me: Return into thy country and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good,
\[10]—I am too small for all the loving-kindness and all the faithfulness that thou hast shewn unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two troops.
\[11]Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, [and] the mother with the children.
\[12]And thou saidst, I will certainly deal well with thee, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
\[13]And he lodged there that night; and took of what came to his hand a gift for Esau his brother—
\[14]two hundred she-goats, and twenty he-goats; two hundred ewes, and twenty rams;
\[15]thirty milch camels with their colts; forty kine, and ten bulls; twenty she-asses, and ten young asses.
\[16]And he delivered [them] into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and he said to his servants, Go on before me, and put a space between drove and drove.
\[17]And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets thee, and asks thee, saying, Whose art thou, and where goest thou, and whose are these before thee?
\[18]—then thou shalt say, Thy servant Jacob's: it is a gift sent to my lord, to Esau. And behold, he also is behind us.
\[19]And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, According to this word shall ye speak to Esau when ye find him.
\[20]And, moreover, ye shall say, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will propitiate him with the gift that goes before me, and afterwards I will see his face: perhaps he will accept me.
\[21]And the gift went over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the camp.
\[22]And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok;
\[23]and he took them and led them over the river, and led over what he had.
\[24]And Jacob remained alone; and a man wrestled with him until the rising of the dawn.
\[25]And when he saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the joint of his thigh; and the joint of Jacob's thigh was dislocated as he wrestled with him.
\[26]And he said, Let me go, for the dawn ariseth. And he said, I will not let thee go except thou bless me.
\[27]And he said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
\[28]And he said, Thy name shall not henceforth be called Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast wrestled with God, and with men, and hast prevailed.
\[29]And Jacob asked and said, Tell [me], I pray thee, thy name. And he said, How is it that thou askest after my name? And he blessed him there.
\[30]And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel—For I have seen God face to face, and my life has been preserved.
\[31]And as he passed over Peniel, the sun rose upon him; and he limped upon his hip.
\[32]Therefore the children of Israel do not eat of the sinew that is over the joint of the thigh, to this day; because he touched the joint of Jacob's thigh—the sinew.

\[3]And he passed on before them, and bowed to the earth seven times, until he came near to his brother.
\[4]And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and they wept.
\[5]And he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children, and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children that God has graciously given thy servant.
\[6]And the maidservants drew near, they and their children, and they bowed.
\[7]And Leah also, with her children, drew near, and they bowed. And lastly Joseph drew near, and Rachel, and they bowed.
\[8]And he said, What [meanest] thou by all the drove which I met? And he said, To find favour in the eyes of my lord.
\[9]And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let what thou hast be thine.
\[10]And Jacob said, No, I pray thee; if now I have found favour in thine eyes, then receive my gift from my hand; for therefore have I seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou hast received me with pleasure.
\[11]Take, I pray thee, my blessing which has been brought to thee; because God has been gracious to me, and because I have everything. And he urged him, and he took [it].
\[12]And he said, Let us take our journey, and go on, and I will go before thee.
\[13]And he said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and the suckling sheep and kine are with me; and if they should overdrive them only one day, all the flock would die.
\[14]Let my lord, I pray thee, pass on before his servant, and I will drive on at my ease according to the pace of the cattle that is before me, and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord, to Seir.
\[15]And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee [some] of the people that are with me. And he said, What need? Let me find favour in the eyes of my lord.
\[16]And Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
\[17]And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house, and for his cattle he made booths. Therefore the name of the place was called Succoth.

\[3]And his soul fastened on Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the maiden, and spoke consolingly to the maiden.
\[4]And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Take me this girl as wife.
\[5]And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; but his sons were with his cattle in the fields, and Jacob said nothing until they came.
\[6]And Hamor the father of Shechem came out to Jacob, to speak to him.
\[7]And the sons of Jacob came from the fields when they heard [it]; and the men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had wrought what was disgraceful in Israel, in lying with Jacob's daughter, which thing ought not to be done.
\[8]And Hamor spoke to them, saying, My son Shechem's soul cleaves to your daughter: I pray you, give her to him as wife.
\[9]And make marriages with us: give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to you.
\[10]And dwell with us, and the land shall be before you: dwell and trade in it, and get yourselves possessions in it.
\[11]And Shechem said to her father and to her brethren, Let me find favour in your eyes; and what ye shall say to me I will give.
\[12]Impose on me very much as dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say to me; but give me the maiden as wife.
\[13]And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and spoke—because he had defiled Dinah their sister—
\[14]and said to them, We cannot do this, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that [were] a reproach to us.
\[15]But only in this will we consent to you, if ye will be as we, that every male of you be circumcised;
\[16]then will we give our daughters to you, and take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and be one people.
\[17]But if ye do not hearken to us, to be circumcised, then will we take our daughter and go away.
\[18]And their words were good in the eyes of Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son.
\[19]And the youth did not delay to do this, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter. And he was honourable above all in the house of his father.
\[20]And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and spoke to the men of their city, saying,
\[21]These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade in it. And the land—behold, it is of wide extent before them. We will take their daughters as wives, and give them our daughters.
\[22]But only in this will the men consent to us to dwell with us, to be one people—if every male among us be circumcised, just as they are circumcised.

\[3]And Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was son of his old age; and he made him a vest of many colours.
\[4]And his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, and they hated him, and could not greet him with friendliness.
\[5]And Joseph dreamed a dream, and told [it] to his brethren, and they hated him yet the more.
\[6]And he said to them, Hear, I pray you, this dream, which I have dreamt:
\[7]Behold, we were binding sheaves in the fields, and lo, my sheaf rose up, and remained standing; and behold, your sheaves came round about and bowed down to my sheaf.
\[8]And his brethren said to him, Wilt thou indeed be a king over us? wilt thou indeed rule over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words.
\[9]And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamt another dream, and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.
\[10]And he told [it] to his father and to his brethren. And his father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream which thou hast dreamt? Shall we indeed come, I and thy mother and thy brethren, to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
\[11]And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying.
\[12]And his brethren went to feed their father's flock at Shechem.
\[13]And Israel said to Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed [the flock] at Shechem? Come, that I may send thee to them. And he said to him, Here am I.
\[14]And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see after the welfare of thy brethren, and after the welfare of the flock; and bring me word again. And he sent him out of the vale of Hebron; and he came towards Shechem.
\[15]And a man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the country; and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
\[16]And he said, I am seeking my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed [their flocks].
\[17]And the man said, They have removed from this; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them at Dothan.
\[18]And when they saw him from afar, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to put him to death.
\[19]And they said one to another, Behold, there comes that dreamer!
\[20]And now come and let us kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, An evil beast has devoured him; and we will see what becomes of his dreams.
\[21]And Reuben heard [it], and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us not take his life.
\[22]And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood: cast him into this pit which is in the wilderness; but lay no hand upon him—in order that he might deliver him out of their hand, to bring him to his father again.
\[23]And it came to pass when Joseph came to his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his vest, the vest of many colours, which he had on;
\[24]and they took him and cast him into the pit; now the pit was empty—there was no water in it.
\[25]And they sat down to eat bread; and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites came from Gilead; and their camels bore tragacanth, and balsam, and ladanum—going to carry [it] down to Egypt.
\[26]And Judah said to his brethren, What profit is it that we kill our brother and secrete his blood?
\[27]Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites; but let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened [to him].
\[28]And Midianitish men, merchants, passed by; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty silver-pieces; and they brought Joseph to Egypt.
\[29]And Reuben returned to the pit, and behold, Joseph [was] not in the pit; and he rent his garments,
\[30]and returned to his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, where shall I go?
\[31]And they took Joseph's vest, and slaughtered a buck of the goats, and dipped the vest in the blood;
\[32]and they sent the vest of many colours and had it carried to their father, and said, This have we found: discern now whether it is thy son's vest or not.
\[33]And he discerned it, and said, [It is] my son's vest! an evil beast has devoured him: Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces!
\[34]And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
\[35]And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, and said, For I will go down to my son into Sheol mourning. Thus his father wept for him.
\[36]And the Midianites sold him into Egypt, to Potiphar, a chamberlain of Pharaoh, the captain of the life-guard.

nd it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a man of Adullam whose name was Hirah.
\[2]And Judah saw there the daughter of a Canaanitish man whose name was Shua; and he took her, and went in to her.
\[3]And she conceived and bore a son; and he called his name Er.
\[4]And she again conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.
\[5]And again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah; and he was at Chezib when she bore him.
\[6]And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
\[7]And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah, and Jehovah slew him.
\[8]Then Judah said to Onan, Go in to thy brother's wife, and fulfil to her the brother-in-law's duty, and raise up seed to thy brother.
\[9]But when Onan knew that the seed should not be his own, it came to pass when he went in to his brother's wife, that he spilled [it] on the ground, in order to give no seed to his brother.
\[10]And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and he slew him also.
\[11]And Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy father's house, until Shelah my son is grown; for he said, Lest he die also, as his brethren. And Tamar went and remained in her father's house.
\[12]And as the days were multiplied, Judah's wife, the daughter of Shua, died. And Judah was comforted, and he went up to his sheep-shearers, to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
\[13]And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.
\[14]And she put the garments of her widowhood off from her, and covered herself with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the entry of Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him as wife.
\[15]And Judah saw her, and took her for a harlot; because she had covered her face.
\[16]And he turned aside to her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me go in to thee; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in to me?
\[17]And he said, I will send [thee] a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give [me] a pledge, until thou send it?
\[18]And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy lace, and thy staff which is in thy hand. And he gave [it] her, and went in to her; and she conceived by him.
\[19]And she arose and went away; and she laid by her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
\[20]And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand; but he found her not.
\[21]And he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute that was at Enaim, by the way-side? And they said, There was no prostitute here.
\[22]And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, No prostitute has been here.
\[23]Then Judah said, Let her take [it] for herself, lest we be put to shame. Behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
\[24]And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law has committed fornication, and behold, she is also with child by fornication. And Judah said, Bring her forth, that she may be burned.
\[25]When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man to whom these [belong] am I with child; and she said, Acknowledge, I pray thee, whose are this signet, and this lace, and this staff.
\[26]And Judah acknowledged [them], and said, She is more righteous than I, because I have not given her to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.
\[27]And it came to pass at the time of her delivery, that behold, twins were in her womb.
\[28]And it came to pass when she brought forth, that one stretched out [his] hand, and the midwife took it and bound round his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
\[29]And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out; and she said, How hast thou broken forth! on thee be the breach! And they called his name Pherez.
\[30]And afterwards came out his brother, round whose hand was the scarlet thread; and they called his name Zerah.

nd Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, a chamberlain of Pharaoh, the captain of the life-guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites who had brought him down thither.
\[2]And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
\[3]And his master saw that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
\[4]And Joseph found favour in his eyes, and attended on him; and he set him over his house, and all that he had he gave into his hand.
\[5]And it came to pass from the time he had set him over his house and all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was on all that he had in the house and in the field.
\[6]And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand, and took cognizance of nothing with him, save the bread that he ate. And Joseph was of a beautiful form and of a beautiful countenance.
\[7]And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph, and said, Lie with me!
\[8]But he refused, and said to his master's wife, Behold, my master takes cognizance of nothing with me: what is in the house, and all that he has, he has given into my hand.
\[9]There is none greater in this house than I; neither has he withheld anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife; and how should I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
\[10]And it came to pass as she spoke to Joseph day by day and he hearkened not to her, to lie with her [and] to be with her,
\[11]that on a certain day he went into the house to do his business, and there was none of the men of the house there in the house.
\[12]Then she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me! But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and ran out.
\[13]And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled forth,
\[14]that she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he has brought in a Hebrew man to us, to mock us: he came in to me, to lie with me; and I cried with a loud voice;
\[15]and it came to pass when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled and went out.
\[16]And she laid his garment by her until his lord came home.
\[17]And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew bondman that thou hast brought to us came in to me to mock me;
\[18]and it came to pass as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled forth.
\[19]And it came to pass when his lord heard the words of his wife which she spoke to him, saying, After this manner did thy bondman to me, that his wrath was kindled.
\[20]And Joseph's lord took him and put him into the tower-house, [the] place where the king's prisoners were confined; and he was there in the tower-house.
\[21]And Jehovah was with Joseph, and extended mercy to him, and gave him favour in the eyes of the chief of the tower-house.
\[22]And the chief of the tower-house committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the tower-house; and whatever they had to do there he did.

nd it came to pass after these things, [that] the cup-bearer of the king of Egypt and the baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.
\[2]And Pharaoh was wroth with his two chamberlains—with the chief of the cup-bearers and with the chief of the bakers;
\[3]and he put them in custody into the house of the captain of the life-guard, into the tower-house, into the place where Joseph was imprisoned.
\[4]And the captain of the life-guard appointed Joseph to them, that he should attend on them. And they were [several] days in custody.
\[5]And they dreamed a dream, both of them in one night, each his dream, each according to the interpretation of his dream, the cup-bearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were imprisoned in the tower-house.
\[6]And Joseph came in to them in the morning, and looked on them, and behold, they were sad.
\[7]And he asked Pharaoh's chamberlains that were with him in custody in his lord's house, saying, Why are your faces [so] sad to-day?
\[8]And they said to him, We have dreamt a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, [Do] not interpretations [belong] to God? tell me [your dreams], I pray you.
\[9]Then the chief of the cup-bearers told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;
\[10]and in the vine were three branches; and it was as though it budded: its blossoms shot forth, its clusters ripened into grapes.
\[11]And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
\[12]And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days.
\[13]In yet three days will Pharaoh lift up thy head and restore thee to thy place, and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his cup-bearer.
\[14]Only bear a remembrance with thee of me when it goes well with thee, and deal kindly, I pray thee, with me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house;
\[15]for indeed I was stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
\[16]And when the chief of the bakers saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head.
\[17]And in the uppermost basket there were all manner of victuals for Pharaoh that the baker makes, and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head.
\[18]And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation of it: the three baskets are three days.
\[19]In yet three days will Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and hang thee on a tree; and the birds will eat thy flesh from off thee.
\[20]And it came to pass the third day—Pharaoh's birthday—that he made a feast to all his bondmen. And he lifted up the head of the chief of the cup-bearers, and the head of the chief of the bakers among his bondmen.
\[21]And he restored the chief of the cup-bearers to his office of cup-bearer again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
\[22]And he hanged the chief of the bakers, as Joseph had interpreted to them.

nd it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed, and behold, he stood by the river.
\[2]And behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fine-looking and fat-fleshed, and they fed in the reed-grass.
\[3]And behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, bad-looking and lean-fleshed, and stood by the kine on the bank of the river.
\[4]And the kine that were bad-looking and lean-fleshed ate up the seven kine that were fine-looking and fat. And Pharaoh awoke.
\[5]And he slept and dreamed the second time; and behold, seven ears of corn grew up on one stalk, fat and good.
\[6]And behold, seven ears, thin and parched with the east wind, sprung up after them.
\[7]And the thin ears devoured the seven fat and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke; and behold, it was a dream.
\[8]And it came to pass in the morning, that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the scribes of Egypt, and all the sages who were therein, and Pharaoh told them his dream; but [there was] none to interpret them to Pharaoh.
\[9]Then spoke the chief of the cup-bearers to Pharaoh, saying, I remember mine offences this day.
\[10]Pharaoh was wroth with his bondmen, and put me in custody into the captain of the life-guard's house, me and the chief of the bakers.
\[11]And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each according to the interpretation of his dream.
\[12]And there was there with us a Hebrew youth, a bondman of the captain of the life-guard, to whom we told [them], and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each he interpreted according to his dream.
\[13]And it came to pass, just as he interpreted to us, so it came about: me has he restored to my office, and him he hanged.
\[14]Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph; and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. And he shaved [himself], and changed his clothes, and came in to Pharaoh.
\[15]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamt a dream, and there is none to interpret it. And I have heard say of thee, thou understandest a dream to interpret it.
\[16]And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
\[17]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood on the bank of the river.
\[18]And behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and of fine form, and they fed in the reed-grass.
\[19]And behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor, and very ill-formed, and lean-fleshed—such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness.
\[20]And the lean and bad kine ate up the seven first fat kine;
\[21]and they came into their belly, and it could not be known that they had come into their belly; and their look was bad, as at the beginning. And I awoke.
\[22]And I saw in my dream, and behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, full and good.
\[23]And behold, seven ears, withered, thin, parched with the east wind, sprung up after them;
\[24]and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears. And I told it to the scribes; but there was none to make it known to me.
\[25]And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God will do he has made known to Pharaoh.
\[26]The seven fine kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
\[27]And the seven lean and bad kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears, parched with the east wind, will be seven years of famine.
\[28]This is the word which I have spoken to Pharaoh: what God is about to do he has let Pharaoh see.
\[29]Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout the land of Egypt.
\[30]And there will arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine will waste away the land.
\[31]And the plenty will not be known afterwards in the land by reason of that famine; for it will be very grievous.
\[32]And as regards the double repetition of the dream to Pharaoh, it is that the thing is established by God, and God will hasten to do it.
\[33]And now let Pharaoh look himself out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
\[34]Let Pharaoh do [this]: let him appoint overseers over the land, and take the fifth part of the land of Egypt during the seven years of plenty,
\[35]and let them gather all the food of these coming good years, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, for food in the cities, and keep [it].
\[36]And let the food be as store for the land for the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt, that the land perish not through the famine.
\[37]And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his bondmen.
\[38]And Pharaoh said to his bondmen, Shall we find [one] as this, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?
\[39]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Since God has made all this known to thee, there is none [so] discreet and wise as thou.
\[40]Thou shalt be over my house, and according to thy commandment shall all my people regulate themselves; only concerning the throne will I be greater than thou.
\[41]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
\[42]And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in clothes of byssus, and put a gold chain on his neck.
\[43]And he caused him to ride in the second chariot that he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee! and he set him over all the land of Egypt.
\[44]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh; and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.
\[45]And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah, and gave him as wife Asnath the daughter of Potipherah the priest in On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
\[46]And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh, and passed through the whole land of Egypt.
\[47]And in the seven years of plenty the land brought forth by handfuls.
\[48]And he gathered up all the food of the seven years that was in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities; the food of the fields of the city, which were round about it, he laid up in it.
\[49]And Joseph laid up corn as sand of the sea exceeding much, until they left off numbering; for it was without number.
\[50]And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asnath the daughter of Potipherah the priest in On bore to him.
\[51]And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh—For God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
\[52]And the name of the second he called Ephraim—For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
\[53]And the seven years of plenty that were in the land of Egypt were ended;
\[54]and the seven years of the dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said. And there was dearth in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
\[55]And all the land of Egypt suffered from the dearth. And the people cried to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph: what he says to you, that do.
\[56]And the famine was on all the earth. And Joseph opened every place in which there was [provision], and sold grain to the Egyptians; and the famine was grievous in the land of Egypt.

\[3]And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy [grain] out of Egypt.
\[4]But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest mischief may befall him.
\[5]So the sons of Israel came to buy [grain] among those that came; for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
\[6]And Joseph, he was the governor over the land—he it was that sold [the corn] to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brethren came and bowed down to him, the face to the earth.
\[7]And Joseph saw his brethren, and knew them; but he made himself strange to them, and spoke roughly to them, and said to them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan, to buy food.
\[8]And Joseph knew his brethren, but they did not know him.
\[9]And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamt of them; and he said to them, Ye are spies: to see the exposed places of the land ye are come.
\[10]And they said to him, No, my lord; but to buy food are thy servants come.
\[11]We are all one man's sons; we are honest: thy servants are not spies.
\[12]And he said to them, No; but to see the exposed places of the land are ye come.
\[13]And they said, Thy servants were twelve brethren, sons of one man, in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
\[14]And Joseph said to them, That is it that I have spoken to you, saying, Ye are spies.
\[15]By this ye shall be put to the proof: as Pharaoh lives, ye shall not go forth hence, unless your youngest brother come hither!
\[16]Send one of you, that he may fetch your brother, but ye shall be imprisoned, and your words shall be put to the proof, whether the truth is in you; and if not, as Pharaoh lives, ye are spies.
\[17]And he put them in custody three days.
\[18]And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, that ye may live: I fear God.
\[19]If ye are honest, let one of your brethren remain bound in the house of your prison, but go ye, carry grain for the hunger of your households;
\[20]and bring your youngest brother to me, in order that your words be verified, and that ye may not die. And they did so.
\[21]Then they said one to another, We are indeed guilty concerning our brother, whose anguish of soul we saw when he besought us, and we did not hearken; therefore this distress is come upon us.
\[22]And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the lad? But ye did not hearken; and now behold, his blood also is required.
\[23]And they did not know that Joseph understood, for the interpreter was between them.
\[24]And he turned away from them, and wept. And he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.
\[25]And Joseph gave orders to fill their vessels with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way. And thus did they to them.
\[26]And they loaded their asses with their grain, and departed thence.
\[27]And one of them opened his sack to give his ass food in the inn, and saw his money, and behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
\[28]And he said to his brethren, My money is returned [to me], and behold, it is even in my sack. And their heart failed [them], and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this [that] God has done to us?
\[29]And they came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,
\[30]The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and treated us as spies of the land.
\[31]And we said to him, We are honest; we are not spies:
\[32]we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
\[33]And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, Hereby shall I know that ye are honest: leave one of your brethren with me, and take [for] the hunger of your households, and go,
\[34]and bring your youngest brother to me, and I shall know that ye are not spies, but are honest. Your brother will I give up to you; and ye may trade in the land.
\[35]And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that behold, every man had his bundle of money in his sack; and they saw their bundles of money, they and their father, and were afraid.
\[36]And Jacob their father said to them, Ye have bereaved me of children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin! All these things are against me.
\[37]And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons if I bring him not back to thee: give him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.

\[6]And Israel said, Why did ye deal [so] ill with me [as] to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
\[7]And they said, The man asked very closely after us, and after our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye a brother? And we told him according to the tenor of these words. Could we at all know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
\[8]And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live, and not die, both we and thou and our little ones.
\[9]I will be surety for him: of my hand shalt thou require him; if I bring him not to thee, and set him before thy face, then shall I be guilty toward thee for ever.
\[10]For had we not lingered, we should now certainly have returned already twice.
\[11]And their father Israel said to them, If it is then so, do this: take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a gift: a little balsam and a little honey, tragacanth and ladanum, pistacia-nuts and almonds.
\[12]And take other money in your hand, and the money that was returned to you in the mouth of your sacks, carry back in your hand: perhaps it is an oversight.
\[13]And take your brother, and arise, go again to the man.
\[14]And the Almighty God give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother and Benjamin! And I, if I be bereaved of children, am bereaved.
\[15]And the men took that gift, and took double money in their hand, and Benjamin, and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and came before Joseph.
\[16]And Joseph saw Benjamin with them, and said to the [man] who was over his house, Bring the men into the house, and slaughter cattle, and make ready; for the men shall eat with me at noon.
\[17]And the man did as Joseph had said; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
\[18]And the men were afraid because they were brought into Joseph's house, and said, Because of the money that was returned to us in our sacks at the beginning are we brought in, that he may turn against us, and fall upon us and take us for bondmen, and our asses.
\[19]And they came up to the man that was over Joseph's house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,
\[20]and said, Ah! my lord, we came indeed down at the first to buy food.
\[21]And it came to pass when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and behold, [every] man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money according to its weight; and we have brought it again in our hand.
\[22]And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.
\[23]And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; your money came to me. And he brought Simeon out to them.
\[24]And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses food.
\[25]And they made ready the gift for Joseph's coming at noon; for they had heard that they should eat bread there.
\[26]When Joseph came home, they brought him the gift that was in their hand, into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
\[27]And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well—the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?
\[28]And they said, Thy servant our father is well; he is yet alive. And they bowed, and made obeisance.
\[29]And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother of whom ye spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to thee, my son!
\[30]And Joseph made haste, for his bowels burned for his brother; and he sought [a place] to weep, and he went into the chamber, and wept there.
\[31]And he washed his face, and came out, and controlled himself, and said, Set on bread.
\[32]And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves; because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
\[33]And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth; and the men marvelled one at another.
\[34]And he had portions carried to them from before him. And Benjamin's portion was five times greater than the portions of them all. And they drank, and made merry with him.

nd he commanded him who was over his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry; and put every man's money in the mouth of his sack.
\[2]And put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his grain-money. And he did according to the word of Joseph which he had spoken.
\[3]In the morning, when it was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
\[4]They were gone out of the city, [and] not [yet] far off, when Joseph said to him who was over his house, Up! follow after the men; and when thou overtakest them, thou shalt say to them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?
\[5]Is not this [it] in which my lord drinks, and in which indeed he divines? Ye have done evil [in] what ye have done.
\[6]And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these words.
\[7]And they said to him, Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from thy servants to do such a thing!
\[8]Behold, the money that we found in our sacks' mouths we have brought again to thee from the land of Canaan; and how should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?
\[9]With whomsoever of thy servants it is found, let him die; and we also will be my lord's bondmen.
\[10]And he said, Now also [let] it [be] according to your words: let him with whom it is found be my bondman, but ye shall be blameless.
\[11]And they hasted and laid down every man his sack on the ground, and opened every man his sack.
\[12]And he searched carefully: he began at the eldest, and ended at the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
\[13]Then they rent their clothes, and loaded every man his ass, and they returned to the city.
\[14]And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; and he was still there; and they fell down before him to the ground.
\[15]And Joseph said to them, What deed is this which ye have done? Did ye not know that such a man as I can certainly divine?
\[16]And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak, and how justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of thy servants; behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he in whose hand the cup has been found.
\[17]And he said, Far be it from me to do so! The man in whose hand the cup has been found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.
\[18]Then Judah came near to him, and said, Ah! my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.
\[19]My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
\[20]And we said to my lord, We have an aged father, and a child born to him in his old age, [yet] young; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him.
\[21]And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set mine eye on him.
\[22]And we said to my lord, The youth cannot leave his father: if he should leave his father, [his father] would die.
\[23]And thou saidst to thy servants, Unless your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
\[24]And it came to pass when we came up to thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
\[25]And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.
\[26]But we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.
\[27]And thy servant my father said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two [sons];
\[28]and the one went out from me, and I said, He must certainly have been torn in pieces; and I have not seen him [again] hitherto.
\[29]And if ye take this one also from me, and mischief should befall him, ye will bring down my grey hairs with misery to Sheol.
\[30]And now, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us,—seeing that his life is bound up with his life,
\[31]it will come to pass when he sees that the lad is not [there], that he will die; and thy servants will bring down the grey hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.
\[32]For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to thee, then I shall be guilty toward my father all my days.
\[33]And now, let thy servant stay, I pray thee, instead of the lad a bondman to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brethren;
\[34]for how should I go up to my father if the lad were not with me?—lest I see the evil that would come on my father.

\[2]And he raised his voice in weeping; and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.
\[3]And Joseph said to his brethren, I am Joseph. Does my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him, for they were troubled at his presence.
\[4]And Joseph said to his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
\[5]And now, be not grieved, and be not angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither, for God sent me before you to preserve life.
\[6]For the famine has been these two years in the land; and yet there are five years in which there will be neither ploughing nor harvest.
\[7]So God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.
\[8]And now it was not you [that] sent me here, but God; and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and governor over all the land of Egypt.
\[9]Haste and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus says thy son Joseph: God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, tarry not.
\[10]And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near to me, thou, and thy sons, and thy sons' sons, and thy sheep, and thy cattle, and all that thou hast.
\[11]And there will I maintain thee; for yet there are five years of famine; in order that thou be not impoverished, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast.
\[12]And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth which speaks to you.
\[13]And tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen, and haste and bring down my father hither.
\[14]And he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept on his neck.
\[15]And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them; and after that his brethren talked with him.
\[16]And the report was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come. And it was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his bondmen.
\[17]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to thy brethren, Do this: load your beasts and depart, go into the land of Canaan,
\[18]and take your father and your households, and come to me; and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
\[19]And thou art commanded—this do: take waggons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and take up your father, and come.
\[20]And let not your eye regret your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt shall be yours.
\[21]And the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them waggons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
\[22]To each one of them all he gave changes of clothing; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred [pieces] of silver and five changes of clothing.
\[23]And to his father he sent this: ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with corn and bread, and food for his father by the way.
\[24]And he sent his brethren away, and they departed. And he said to them, Do not quarrel on the way.
\[25]And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.
\[26]And they told him, saying, Joseph is still alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he did not believe them.
\[27]And they spoke to him all the words of Joseph, which he had spoken to them. And he saw the waggons that Joseph had sent to carry him. And the spirit of Jacob their father revived.
\[28]And Israel said, It is enough: Joseph my son is yet alive; I will go and see him before I die.

\[4]I will go down with thee to Egypt, and I will also certainly bring thee up; and Joseph shall put his hand on thine eyes.
\[5]And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba; and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, on the waggons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
\[6]And they took their cattle, and their goods which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt, Jacob and all his seed with him;
\[7]his sons and his sons' sons with him, his daughters and his sons' daughters and all his seed he brought with him to Egypt.
\[8]And these are the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt: Jacob and his sons. Jacob's firstborn, Reuben.
\[9]And the sons of Reuben: Enoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.

\[11]—And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
\[12]—And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pherez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pherez were Hezron and Hamul.
\[13]—And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puah, and Job, and Shimron.
\[14]—And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
\[15]—These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Padan-Aram; and his daughter, Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three.
\[16]And the sons of Gad: Ziphion and Haggi, Shuni and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
\[17]—And the sons of Asher: Jimnah, and Jishvah, and Jishvi, and Beriah; and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.
\[18]—These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and she bore these to Jacob: sixteen souls.
\[19]The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.
\[20]And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asnath bore to him, the daughter of Potipherah the priest in On.
\[21]—And the sons of Benjamin: Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.
\[22]—These are the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.
\[23]And the sons of Dan: Hushim.

\[26]All the souls that came with Jacob to Egypt, that had come out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives: all the souls were sixty-six.

\[32]and the men are shepherds, for they have been occupied with cattle; and they have brought their sheep, and their cattle, and all that they have.
\[33]And it shall come to pass that when Pharaoh shall call you and say, What is your occupation?

\[2]And he took from the whole number of his brethren, five men, and set them before Pharaoh.
\[3]And Pharaoh said to his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers.
\[4]And they said to Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for the sheep that thy servants have, for the famine is grievous in the land of Canaan; and now, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
\[5]And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come to thee.
\[6]The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land settle thy father and thy brethren: let them dwell in the land of Goshen. And if thou knowest men of activity among them, then set them as overseers of cattle over what I have.
\[7]And Joseph brought Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
\[8]And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life?
\[9]And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my sojourning are a hundred and thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they do not attain to the days of the years of the life of my fathers, in the days of their sojourning.
\[10]And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from Pharaoh.
\[11]And Joseph settled his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
\[12]And Joseph maintained his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to the number of the little ones.
\[13]And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very grievous; and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan were exhausted through the famine.
\[14]And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
\[15]And when money came to an end in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, saying, Give us bread! for why should we die before thee? for [our] money is all gone.
\[16]And Joseph said, Give your cattle, and I will give you for your cattle, if [your] money be all gone.
\[17]And they brought their cattle to Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread for horses, and for flocks of sheep, and for herds of cattle, and for asses; and he fed them with bread for all their cattle that year.
\[18]And that year ended; and they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide [it] from my lord that since [our] money is come to an end, and the herds of cattle are in the possession of my lord, nothing is left before my lord but our bodies and our land.
\[19]Why should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be bondmen to Pharaoh; and give seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate.
\[20]And Joseph bought all the soil of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them; and the land became Pharaoh's.
\[21]And as for the people, he removed them into the cities, from [one] end of the borders of Egypt even to the [other] end of it.
\[22]Only the land of the priests he did not buy; for the priests had an assigned portion from Pharaoh, and ate their assigned portion which Pharaoh had given them; so they did not sell their land.
\[23]And Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and sow the land.
\[24]And it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall give the fifth to Pharaoh, and the four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.
\[25]And they said, Thou hast saved us alive. Let us find favour in the eyes of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's bondmen.
\[26]And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, [that] the fifth should be for Pharaoh, except the land of the priests: theirs alone did not become Pharaoh's.
\[27]And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they had possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly.
\[28]And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; and the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred and forty-seven years.
\[29]And the days of Israel approached that he should die. And he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found favour in thine eyes, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt;
\[30]but when I shall lie with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their sepulchre. And he said, I will do according to thy word.

\[2]And one told Jacob and said, Behold, thy son Joseph is coming to thee. And Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
\[3]And Jacob said to Joseph, The Almighty God appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
\[4]and he said to me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples; and will give this land to thy seed after thee [for] an everlasting possession.
\[5]And now thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came to thee into Egypt, shall be mine: Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon.
\[6]And thy family which thou hast begotten after them shall be thine: they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
\[7]And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was yet a certain distance to come to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath, that is, Bethlehem.
\[8]And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?
\[9]And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, to me, that I may bless them.
\[10]But the eyes of Israel were heavy from age: he could not see. And he brought them nearer to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
\[11]And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face; and behold, God has let me see also thy seed.
\[12]And Joseph brought them out from his knees, and bowed down with his face to the earth.
\[13]And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought [them] near to him.
\[14]But Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid [it] on Ephraim's head—now he was the younger—and his left hand on Manasseh's head; guiding his hands intelligently, for Manasseh was the firstborn.
\[15]And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God that shepherded me all my life long to this day,
\[16]the Angel that redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the land!
\[17]When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it was evil in his eyes; and he took hold of his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
\[18]And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn: put thy right hand on his head.
\[19]But his father refused and said, I know, my son, I know: he also will become a people, and he also will be great; but truly his younger brother will be greater than he; and his seed will become the fulness of nations.
\[20]And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and Manasseh! And he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
\[21]And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die; and God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.

\[28]All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke to them; and he blessed them: every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
\[29]And he charged them, and said to them, I am gathered to my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
\[30]in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is opposite to Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought of Ephron the Hittite along with the field for a possession of a sepulchre.
\[31]There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebecca his wife; and there I buried Leah.
\[32]The purchase of the field, and of the cave that is in it, was from the children of Heth.
\[33]And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered his feet into the bed, and expired, and was gathered to his peoples.

nd Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
\[2]And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. And the physicians embalmed Israel.
\[3]And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
\[4]And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favour in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
\[5]My father made me swear, saying, Behold, I die; in my grave which I have dug myself in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. And now, let me go up, I pray thee, that I may bury my father; and I will come again.
\[6]And Pharaoh said, Go up and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
\[7]And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the bondmen of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
\[8]and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house; only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
\[9]And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and the camp was very great.
\[10]And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan; and there they lamented with a great and very grievous lamentation; and he made a mourning for his father of seven days.
\[11]And the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing-floor of Atad, and they said, This is a grievous mourning of the Egyptians. Therefore the name of it was called Abel-Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
\[12]And his sons did to him according as he had commanded them;
\[13]and his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah which Abraham had bought along with the field, for a possession of a sepulchre, of Ephron the Hittite, opposite to Mamre.
\[14]And, after he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that had gone up with him to bury his father.
\[15]And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, If now Joseph should be hostile to us, and should indeed requite us all the evil that we did to him!
\[16]And they sent a messenger to Joseph, saying, Thy father commanded before he died, saying,
\[17]Thus shall ye speak to Joseph: Oh forgive, I pray thee, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin! for they did evil to thee. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
\[18]And his brethren also went and fell down before his face, and said, Behold, we are thy bondmen.
\[19]And Joseph said to them, Fear not: am I then in the place of God?
\[20]Ye indeed meant evil against me: God meant it for good, in order that he might do as [it is] this day, to save a great people alive.
\[21]And now, fear not: I will maintain you and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke consolingly to them.
\[22]And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father's house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.
\[23]And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third [generation]; the sons also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born on Joseph's knees.
\[24]And Joseph said to his brethren, I die; and God will certainly visit you, and bring you up out of this land, into the land that he swore unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
\[25]And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will certainly visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones hence.
\[26]And Joseph died, a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him; and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

\[2]Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;
\[3]Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;
\[4]Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.
\[5]And all the souls that had come out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls; and Joseph was in Egypt.
\[6]And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
\[7]And the children of Israel were fruitful, and swarmed and multiplied, and became exceeding strong; and the land was full of them.
\[8]And there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.
\[9]And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more numerous and stronger than we.
\[10]Come on, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass that, if war occur, they take side with our enemies and fight against us, and go up out of the land.
\[11]And they set over them service-masters to oppress them with their burdens. And they built store-cities for Pharaoh, Pithom and Rameses.
\[12]But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and spread; and they were distressed because of the children of Israel.
\[13]And the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with harshness;
\[14]and they embittered their life with hard labour in clay and bricks, and in all manner of labour in the field: all their labour with which they made them serve was with harshness.
\[15]And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives—of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other was Puah—
\[16]and he said, When ye help the Hebrew women in bearing, and see [them] on the stool, if it be a son, then ye shall kill him, but if a daughter, then she shall live.
\[17]But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt had said to them, but saved the male children alive.
\[18]And the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them, Why have ye done this, and saved the male children alive?
\[19]And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian; for they are strong, and they have borne before the midwife comes to them.
\[20]And God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied and became very strong.
\[21]And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.
\[22]Then Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, but every daughter ye shall save alive.

\[2]And the woman conceived, and bore a son. And she saw him that he was fair, and hid him three months.
\[3]And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of reeds, and plastered it with resin and with pitch, and put the child in it, and laid [it] in the sedge on the bank of the river.
\[4]And his sister stood afar off to see what would happen to him.
\[5]And the daughter of Pharaoh went down to bathe in the river; and her maids went along by the river's side. And she saw the ark in the midst of the sedge, and sent her handmaid and fetched it.
\[6]And she opened [it], and saw the child, and behold, the boy wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is [one] of the Hebrews' children.
\[7]And his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call thee a wet-nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
\[8]And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the damsel went and called the child's mother.
\[9]And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give [thee] thy wages. And the woman took the child and nursed it.
\[10]And when the child was grown, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.
\[11]And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren and looked on their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
\[12]And he turned this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
\[13]And he went out on the second day, and behold, two Hebrew men were quarrelling; and he said to him that was in the wrong, Why art thou smiting thy neighbour?
\[14]And he said, Who made thee ruler and judge over us? dost thou intend to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? Then Moses feared, and said, Surely the matter is known.
\[15]And Pharaoh heard of this matter, and sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from before Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian. And he sat by the well.
\[16]And the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew [water], and filled the troughs, to water their father's flock.
\[17]And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses rose and helped them, and watered their flock.
\[18]And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, Why are ye come so soon to-day?
\[19]And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew [water] abundantly for us, and watered the flock.
\[20]And he said to his daughters, And where is he? why then have ye left the man behind? Call him, that he may eat bread.
\[21]And Moses consented to remain with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
\[22]And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.
\[23]And it came to pass during those many days, that the king of Egypt died. And the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and cried; and their cry came up to God because of the bondage;
\[24]and God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob;

\[2]And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a thorn-bush: and he looked, and behold, the thorn-bush burned with fire, and the thorn-bush was not being consumed.
\[3]And Moses said, Let me now turn aside and see this great sight, why the thorn-bush is not burnt.
\[4]And Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, and God called to him out of the midst of the thorn-bush and said, Moses, Moses! And he said, Here am I.
\[5]And he said, Draw not nigh hither: loose thy sandals from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
\[6]And he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look at God.
\[7]And Jehovah said, I have seen assuredly the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and their cry have I heard on account of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows.
\[8]And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good and spacious land, unto a land flowing with milk and honey, unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
\[9]And now behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me; and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.
\[10]And now come, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
\[11]And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
\[12]And he said, For I will be with thee; and this shall be the sign to thee that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
\[13]And Moses said to God, Behold, [when] I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?
\[14]And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM. And he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: I AM hath sent me unto you.
\[15]And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you. This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.
\[16]Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying, I have indeed visited you, and [seen] that which is done unto you in Egypt;
\[17]and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt, unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.
\[18]And they shall hearken to thy voice. And thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath met with us; and now, let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.
\[19]But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a powerful hand.
\[20]And I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof; and after that he will let you go.
\[21]And I will give this people favour in the eyes of the Egyptians, and it shall come to pass, when ye go out, that ye shall not go out empty;
\[22]but every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her that is the inmate of her house, utensils of silver, and utensils of gold, and clothing; and ye shall put [them] on your sons and on your daughters, and shall spoil the Egyptians.

\[3]And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.
\[4]And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand and take it by the tail—and he stretched out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand—
\[5]that they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.
\[6]And Jehovah said moreover to him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom, and took it out, and behold, his hand was leprous, as snow.
\[7]And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again, and took it out of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again as his flesh.
\[8]And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the other sign.

\[10]And Moses said to Jehovah, Ah Lord! I am not eloquent, neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken to thy servant, for I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue.
\[11]And Jehovah said to him, Who gave man a mouth? or who maketh dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? [have] not I, Jehovah?
\[12]And now go, and I will be with thy mouth, and will teach thee what thou shalt say.
\[13]And he said, Ah Lord! send, I pray thee, by the hand [of him whom] thou wilt send.
\[14]Then the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also behold, he goeth out to meet thee; and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart.
\[15]And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.
\[16]And he shall speak for thee unto the people; and it shall come to pass that he shall be to thee for a mouth, and thou shalt be to him for God.

\[18]And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return to my brethren who are in Egypt, that I may see whether they are yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.
\[19]And Jehovah said to Moses in Midian, Go, return to Egypt; for all the men are dead who sought thy life.
\[20]And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them riding upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God in his hand.
\[21]And Jehovah said to Moses, When thou goest to return to Egypt, see that thou do all the wonders before Pharaoh that I have put in thy hand. And I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.
\[22]And thou shalt say to Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah: Israel is my son, my firstborn.

\[7]Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.

\[11]go ye, get yourselves straw where ye may find it; but none of your work shall be diminished.
\[12]And the people were scattered abroad throughout the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.

\[14]And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, [and] it was said, Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick, both yesterday and to-day, as heretofore?
\[15]Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why dost thou deal thus with thy bondmen?
\[16]There is no straw given to thy bondmen, and they say to us, Make brick; and behold, thy bondmen are beaten, but it is the fault of thy people.
\[17]And he said, Ye are idle, idle! therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah.
\[18]And now go—work! and straw shall not be given you, and ye shall deliver the measure of bricks.
\[19]And the officers of the children of Israel saw [that] it stood ill with them, because it was said, Ye shall not diminish anything from your bricks, the daily work.

\[15]Go unto Pharaoh in the morning—behold, he will go out unto the water—and take thy stand by the bank of the river in front of him; and take in thy hand the staff that was turned into a serpent.
\[16]And say unto him, Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has sent me to thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness; but behold, hitherto thou hast not hearkened.

\[18]And the fish that is in the river shall die; and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink the water out of the river.
\[19]And Jehovah said to Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy staff, and stretch out thy hand upon the waters of the Egyptians—upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their reservoirs of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout the land of Egypt, both in [vessels of] wood and in [vessels of] stone.
\[20]And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah had commanded; and he lifted up the staff, and smote the waters that were in the river before the eyes of Pharaoh, and before the eyes of his bondmen; and all the waters that were in the river were turned into blood.
\[21]And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river; and the blood was throughout the land of Egypt.
\[22]And the scribes of Egypt did so with their sorceries; and Pharaoh's heart was stubborn, neither did he hearken to them, as Jehovah had said.
\[23]And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and took not this to heart either.
\[24]And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.
\[25]And seven days were fulfilled, after Jehovah had smitten the river.

\[2]And if thou refuse to let [them] go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs.
\[3]And the river shall swarm with frogs, and they shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bedroom, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy bondmen, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs.
\[4]And the frogs shall come up both upon thee and upon thy people, and upon all thy bondmen.
\[5]And Jehovah said to Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy hand with thy staff over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.
\[6]And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
\[7]And the scribes did so with their sorceries, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.
\[8]And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat Jehovah, that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to Jehovah.
\[9]And Moses said to Pharaoh, Glory over me, for what time shall I intreat for thee, and for thy bondmen, and for thy people, to cut off the frogs from thee and from thy houses; [so that] they shall remain in the river only?
\[10]And he said, For to-morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like Jehovah our God.
\[11]And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy bondmen, and from thy people: they shall remain in the river only.
\[12]And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried to Jehovah because of the frogs that he had brought against Pharaoh.
\[13]And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.
\[14]And they gathered them in heaps; and the land stank.
\[15]And Pharaoh saw that there was respite; and he hardened his heart, and hearkened not to them, as Jehovah had said.
\[16]And Jehovah said to Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy staff, and smite the dust of the earth, and it shall become gnats throughout the land of Egypt.
\[17]And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, and smote the dust of the earth, and there arose gnats on man and on beast: all the dust of the land became gnats throughout the land of Egypt.
\[18]And the scribes did so with their sorceries, to bring forth gnats; but they could not. And the gnats were on man and on beast.
\[19]Then the scribes said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God! But Pharaoh's heart was stubborn, and he hearkened not to them, as Jehovah had said.
\[20]And Jehovah said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh—behold, he will go out to the water—and say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[21]For, if thou do not let my people go, behold, I will send dog-flies upon thee, and upon thy bondmen, and upon thy people, and into thy houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of dog-flies, and also the ground on which they are.
\[22]And I will distinguish in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no dog-flies shall be there; that thou mayest know that I Jehovah am in the midst of the land.
\[23]And I will put a separation between my people and thy people; to-morrow shall this sign be.
\[24]And Jehovah did so; and there came dog-flies in a multitude into the house of Pharaoh, and [into] the houses of his bondmen; and throughout the land of Egypt, the land was corrupted by the dog-flies.
\[25]And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.
\[26]And Moses said, It is not proper to do so; for we should sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God: lo, if we sacrificed the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, would they not stone us?
\[27]We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God, as he shall command us.
\[28]And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only, go not very far away: intreat for me!
\[29]And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and will intreat Jehovah; and the dog-flies will depart from Pharaoh, from his bondmen, and from his people, to-morrow; only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah.
\[30]And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated Jehovah.
\[31]And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the dog-flies from Pharaoh, from his bondmen, and from his people; there remained not one.

\[2]For if thou refuse to let them go, and shalt retain them still,
\[3]behold, the hand of Jehovah shall be on thy cattle which is in the field, on the horses, on the asses, on the camels, on the oxen and on the sheep, with a very grievous plague.
\[4]And Jehovah will distinguish between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that the children of Israel have.
\[5]And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow will Jehovah do this thing in the land.
\[6]And Jehovah did this thing on the following day, and all the cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.
\[7]And Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
\[8]And Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to yourselves handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses scatter it toward the heavens before the eyes of Pharaoh.
\[9]And it shall become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall become boils on man and on cattle, breaking out [with] blisters, throughout the land of Egypt.
\[10]And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it toward the heavens; and it became boils [with] blisters breaking out on man and on cattle.
\[11]And the scribes could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were on the scribes, and on all the Egyptians.
\[12]And Jehovah made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he did not hearken to them, as Jehovah had told Moses.
\[13]And Jehovah said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and set thyself before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews: Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[14]For I will at this time send all my plagues to thy heart, and on thy bondmen, and on thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.
\[15]For now shall I put forth my hand, and I will smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.
\[16]And for this very cause have I raised thee up, to shew thee my power; and that my name may be declared in all the earth.
\[17]Dost thou still exalt thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?
\[18]Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since its foundation until now.
\[19]And now send, [and] secure thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field: all the men and the cattle that are found in the field, and are not brought home—on them the hail shall come down, and they shall die.
\[20]He that feared the word of Jehovah among the bondmen of Pharaoh made his bondmen and his cattle flee into the houses.
\[21]But he that did not regard the word of Jehovah left his bondmen and his cattle in the field.
\[22]And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward the heavens, that there may be hail throughout the land of Egypt, upon men, and upon cattle, and upon every herb of the field in the land of Egypt.
\[23]And Moses stretched out his staff toward the heavens, and Jehovah gave thunder and hail; and the fire ran along the ground; and Jehovah rained hail on the land of Egypt.
\[24]And there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there had been none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
\[25]And the hail smote throughout the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both men and cattle; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.
\[26]Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.
\[27]And Pharaoh sent, and called Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time: Jehovah is the righteous [one], but I and my people are the wicked [ones].
\[28]Intreat Jehovah that it may be enough, that there be no more thunder of God and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer!
\[29]And Moses said to him, When I go out of the city, I will spread out my hands to Jehovah: the thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail; that thou mayest know that the earth is Jehovah's.
\[30]But as to thee and thy bondmen, I know that ye do not yet fear Jehovah Elohim.
\[31]And the flax and the barley were smitten; for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.
\[32]But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten; for they were not come out into ear.
\[33]And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread out his hands to Jehovah; and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not [any more] poured on the earth.
\[34]And Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased, and he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he, and his bondmen.
\[35]And the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, neither would he let the children of Israel go, as Jehovah had spoken by Moses.

\[2]and that thou mightest tell in the ears of thy son and thy son's son what I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[3]And Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah the God of the Hebrews: How long dost thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[4]For, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, I will to-morrow bring locusts into thy borders;
\[5]and they shall cover the face of the land, so that ye will not be able to see the land; and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which ye have remaining from the hail, and shall eat every tree which ye have growing in the field;
\[6]and they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy bondmen, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned and went out from Pharaoh.
\[7]And Pharaoh's bondmen said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? let the men go, that they may serve Jehovah their God: dost thou not yet know that Egypt is ruined?
\[8]And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh. And he said to them, Go, serve Jehovah your God. Who are they that shall go?
\[9]And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters; with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we have a feast of Jehovah.
\[10]And he said to them, Let Jehovah be so with you, as I let you go, and your little ones: see that evil is before you!
\[11]Not so: go now, ye [that are] men, and serve Jehovah! for it is that ye have desired. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
\[12]And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up over the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land—all that the hail hath left.
\[13]And Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind on the land all that day and all that night. When it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
\[14]And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt, very grievous; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them will be such.
\[15]And they covered the face of the whole land, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left; and there remained not any green thing on the trees, and in the herbs of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.
\[16]And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you.
\[17]And now, forgive, I pray you, my sin only this time, and intreat Jehovah your God that he may take away from me this death only!
\[18]And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated Jehovah.
\[19]And Jehovah turned a very powerful west wind, which took away the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea: there remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.
\[20]And Jehovah made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he did not let the children of Israel go.
\[21]And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward the heavens, that there may be darkness in the land of Egypt—so that one may feel darkness.
\[22]And Moses stretched out his hand toward the heavens; and there was a thick darkness throughout the land of Egypt three days:
\[23]they saw not one another, neither rose any from his place, for three days. But all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
\[24]And Pharaoh called Moses and said, Go, serve Jehovah; only, let your flocks and your herds remain; let your little ones also go with you.
\[25]And Moses said, Thou must give also sacrifices and burnt-offerings into our hands, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.
\[26]Our cattle also must go with us: there shall not a hoof be left behind; for we must take thereof to serve Jehovah our God; and we do not know with what we must serve Jehovah, until we come there.

\[4]And if the household be too small for a lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take [it] according to the number of the souls; each according to [the measure] of his eating shall ye count for the lamb.
\[5]Your lamb shall be without blemish, a yearling male; ye shall take [it] from the sheep, or from the goats.
\[6]And ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; and the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel shall kill it between the two evenings.
\[7]And they shall take of the blood, and put [it] on the two door-posts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.
\[8]And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter [herbs] shall they eat it.
\[9]Ye shall eat none of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with its in-wards.
\[10]And ye shall let none of it remain until the morning; and what remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.
\[11]And thus shall ye eat it: your loins shall be girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste; it is Jehovah's passover.
\[12]And I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am Jehovah.
\[13]And the blood shall be for you as a sign on the houses in which ye are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be among you for destruction, when I smite the land of Egypt.
\[14]And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall celebrate it [as] a feast to Jehovah; throughout your generations [as] an ordinance for ever shall ye celebrate it.
\[15]Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread: on the very first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses; for whoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day—that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
\[16]And on the first day ye shall have a holy convocation, and on the seventh day a holy convocation: no manner of work shall be done on them, save what is eaten by every person—that only shall be done by you.
\[17]And ye shall keep the [feast of] unleavened [bread]; for in this same day have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; and ye shall keep this day in your generations [as] an ordinance for ever.
\[18]In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month in the evening.

\[40]And the residence of the children of Israel that they resided in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.
\[41]And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, on that same day it came to pass that all the hosts of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt.

\[44]but every man's bondman that is bought for money—let him be circumcised: then shall he eat it.
\[45]A settler and a hired servant shall not eat it.
\[46]In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth any of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.

\[48]And when a sojourner sojourneth with thee, and would hold the passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and hold it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land; but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.
\[49]One law shall be for him that is home-born and for the sojourner that sojourneth among you.

\[6]Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread; and in the seventh day is a feast to Jehovah.
\[7]Unleavened bread shall be eaten the seven days; and leavened bread shall not be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy borders.

\[9]And it shall be for a sign to thee on thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of Jehovah may be in thy mouth; for with a powerful hand hath Jehovah brought thee out of Egypt.

\[11]And it shall be when Jehovah hath brought thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he hath sworn to thee and to thy fathers, and hath given it thee,
\[12]that thou shalt offer unto Jehovah all that breaketh open the womb, and every firstling that cometh of cattle which is thine: the males [shall be] Jehovah's.
\[13]And every firstling of an ass shalt thou ransom with a lamb; and if thou do not ransom it, thou shalt break its neck; and every firstborn of a man among thy sons shalt thou ransom.
\[14]And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say to him, With a powerful hand Jehovah brought us out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
\[15]And it came to pass, when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, that Jehovah slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of men and the firstborn of cattle: therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that breaketh open the womb—being males; and every firstborn of my children I ransom.
\[16]And it shall be for a sign on thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes, for with a powerful hand Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt.
\[17]And it came to pass, when Pharaoh let the people go, that God did not lead them the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, That the people may not repent when they see conflict, and return to Egypt.
\[18]And God led the people about, the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went arrayed out of the land of Egypt.
\[19]And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him; for he had made the children of Israel swear an oath, saying, God will be sure to visit you; then ye shall carry my bones with you hence.
\[20]And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, at the end of the wilderness.
\[21]And Jehovah went before their face by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them [in] the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; so that they could go day and night.

\[9]And the Egyptians pursued after them,—all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them where they had encamped by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, opposite to Baal-Zephon.
\[10]And Pharaoh approached; and the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and the children of Israel were much afraid, and cried out to Jehovah.
\[11]And they said to Moses, Is it because there were no graves in Egypt, thou hast taken us away to die in the wilderness? why hast thou done this to us, that thou hast led us out of Egypt?
\[12]Is not this what we told thee in Egypt, when we said, Let us alone, and we will serve the Egyptians? For [it had been] better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.
\[13]And Moses said to the people, Fear not: stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will work for you to-day; for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.
\[14]Jehovah will fight for you, and ye shall be still.
\[15]And Jehovah said to Moses, Why dost thou cry unto me? Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.
\[16]And thou, lift thy staff, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go on dry [ground] through the midst of the sea.
\[17]And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall pursue after them; and I will glorify myself in Pharaoh and in all his host, in his chariots and in his horsemen.
\[18]And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have glorified myself in Pharaoh, in his chariots and in his horsemen.
\[19]And the Angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before them, and stood behind them.
\[20]And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and was a cloud and darkness, and lit up the night; and the one did not come near the other all the night.
\[21]And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah made the sea go [back] by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry [land], and the waters were divided.
\[22]And the children of Israel went through the midst of the sea on the dry [ground]; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
\[23]And the Egyptians pursued and came after them—all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots and his horsemen, into the midst of the sea.
\[24]And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Jehovah looked upon the camp of the Egyptians, in the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and embarrassed the camp of the Egyptians.
\[25]And he took off their chariot wheels, and caused them to drive with difficulty; and the Egyptians said, Let us flee before Israel, for Jehovah is fighting for them against the Egyptians!
\[26]And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may return upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and upon their horsemen.
\[27]And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength toward the morning; and the Egyptians fled against it; and Jehovah overturned the Egyptians into the midst of the sea.
\[28]And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen of all the host of Pharaoh that had come into the sea after them; there remained not even one of them.
\[29]And the children of Israel walked on dry [ground] through the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
\[30]Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the sea-shore.
\[31]And Israel saw the great power [with] which Jehovah had wrought against the Egyptians; and the people feared Jehovah, and believed in Jehovah, and in Moses his bondman.

\[2]My strength and song is Jah, and he is become my salvation: This is my God, and I will glorify him; My father's God, and I will extol him.
\[3]Jehovah is a man of war; Jehovah, his name.
\[4]Pharaoh's chariots and his army hath he cast into the sea; His chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea.
\[5]The depths covered them; they sank to the bottom as a stone.
\[6]Thy right hand, Jehovah, is become glorious in power: Thy right hand, Jehovah, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.
\[7]And by the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown thine adversaries: Thou sentest forth thy burning wrath, it consumed them as stubble.
\[8]And by the breath of thy nostrils the waters were heaped up; The streams stood as a mound; The depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.
\[9]The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my soul shall be sated upon them; I will unsheath my sword, my hand shall dispossess them.
\[10]Thou didst blow with thy breath, the sea covered them; They sank as lead in the mighty waters.
\[11]Who is like unto thee, Jehovah, among the gods? Who is like unto thee, glorifying thyself in holiness, Fearful [in] praises, doing wonders?
\[12]Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.
\[13]Thou by thy mercy hast led forth the people that thou hast redeemed; Thou hast guided them by thy strength unto the abode of thy holiness.
\[14]The peoples heard it, they were afraid: A thrill seized the inhabitants of Philistia.
\[15]Then the princes of Edom were amazed; The mighty men of Moab, trembling hath seized them; All the inhabitants of Canaan melted away.
\[16]Fear and dread fall upon them; By the greatness of thine arm they are still as a stone; Till thy people pass over, Jehovah, Till the people pass over that thou hast purchased.
\[17]Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, The place that thou, Jehovah, hast made thy dwelling, The Sanctuary, Lord, that thy hands have prepared.
\[18]Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever!
\[19]For the horse of Pharaoh, with his chariots and with his horsemen, came into the sea, and Jehovah brought again the waters of the sea upon them; and the children of Israel went on dry [ground] through the midst of the sea.
\[20]And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took the tambour in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambours and with dances.
\[21]And Miriam answered them, Sing to Jehovah, for he is highly exalted: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
\[22]And Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
\[23]And they came to Marah, and could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore the name of it was called Marah.
\[24]And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
\[25]And he cried to Jehovah; and Jehovah shewed him wood, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters became sweet. There he made for them a statute and an ordinance; and there he tested them.
\[26]And he said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, and do what is right in his eyes, and incline thine ears to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the complaints upon thee that I have put upon the Egyptians; for I am Jehovah who healeth thee.
\[27]And they came to Elim; and twelve springs of water were there, and seventy palm trees; and they encamped there by the waters.

nd they journeyed from Elim, and the whole assembly of the children of Israel came into the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure out of the land of Egypt.
\[2]And the whole assembly of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness.
\[3]And the children of Israel said to them, Would that we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, when we ate bread to the full; for ye have brought us out into this wilderness, to kill this whole congregation with hunger!
\[4]Then said Jehovah to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather the daily need on its day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.
\[5]And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare what they have brought in; and it shall be twice as much as they shall gather daily.
\[6]And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, In the evening, then shall ye know that Jehovah has brought you out from the land of Egypt;
\[7]and in the morning, then shall ye see the glory of Jehovah; for he has heard your murmurings against Jehovah;—and what are we, that ye murmur against us?
\[8]And Moses said, When Jehovah gives you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for Jehovah hears your murmurings which ye murmur against him … and what [are] we? your murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah.
\[9]And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the assembly of the children of Israel, Come near into the presence of Jehovah; for he has heard your murmurings.
\[10]And it came to pass, when Aaron spoke to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, that they turned toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud.
\[11]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[12]I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak to them, saying, Between the two evenings ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God.
\[13]And it came to pass in the evening, that quails came up, and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay round the camp.
\[14]And when the dew that lay [round it] was gone up, behold, on the face of the wilderness there was [something] fine, granular, fine as hoar-frost, on the ground.
\[15]And the children of Israel saw [it], and said one to another, What is it? for they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, This is the bread which Jehovah has given you to eat.
\[16]This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded: Gather of it every man according to what he can eat, an omer a poll, [according to] the number of your persons: ye shall take every man for those that are in his tent.
\[17]And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some much, some little.
\[18]And they measured with the omer: then he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little wanted nothing: they had gathered every man according to the measure of his eating.
\[19]And Moses said to them, Let no man leave [any] of it until the morning.
\[20]But they did not hearken to Moses; and some men left of it until the morning; then worms bred in it and it stank. And Moses was wroth with them.
\[21]And they gathered it every morning, every man as much as he could eat; and when the sun became hot, it melted.
\[22]And it came to pass on the sixth day, that they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one; and all the princes of the assembly came and told Moses.
\[23]And he said to them, This is what Jehovah has said: To-morrow is the rest, the holy sabbath, of Jehovah: bake what ye will bake, and cook what ye will cook; and lay up for yourselves all that remains over, to be kept for the morning.
\[24]And they laid it up for the morning, as Moses had commanded; and it did not stink, neither was there any worm in it.
\[25]And Moses said, Eat it to-day; for to-day is sabbath to Jehovah: to-day ye shall not find it in the field.
\[26]Six days shall ye gather it; but on the seventh day is sabbath: on it there shall be none.
\[27]And it came to pass on the seventh day that there went out [some] from the people to gather [it], and they found none.
\[28]And Jehovah said to Moses, How long do ye refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?
\[29]See, for Jehovah hath given you the sabbath; therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread for two days. Abide every man in his place: let no man go from his place on the seventh day.
\[30]And the people rested on the seventh day.
\[31]And the house of Israel called its name Manna; and it was like coriander-seed, white; and the taste of it was like cake with honey.
\[32]And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded: Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread that I gave you to eat in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.
\[33]And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put in it an omer full of manna, and deposit it before Jehovah, to be kept for your generations.
\[34]As Jehovah had commanded Moses, so Aaron deposited it before the Testimony, to be kept.
\[35]And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came into an inhabited land: they ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.

\[2]And the people contended with Moses, and said, Give us water, that we may drink! And Moses said to them, Why do ye dispute with me? Why do ye tempt Jehovah?
\[3]And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why is it that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?
\[4]And Moses cried to Jehovah, saying, What shall I do with this people? Yet a little, and they will stone me!
\[5]And Jehovah said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel, and thy staff with which thou didst smite the river, take in thy hand, and go.
\[6]Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock on Horeb; and thou shalt strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel.
\[7]And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the contention of the children of Israel, and because they had tempted Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah among us, or not?
\[8]And Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
\[9]And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us men, and go out, fight with Amalek; to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.
\[10]And Joshua did as Moses had said to him, to fight with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
\[11]And it came to pass when Moses raised his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
\[12]And Moses' hands were heavy; then they took a stone, and put [it] under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on this side, and one on that side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
\[13]And Joshua broke the power of Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
\[14]And Jehovah said to Moses, Write this [for] a memorial in the book, and rehearse [it] in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens.
\[15]And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi.

\[3]and her two sons, of whom the name of the one was Gershom—for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land,
\[4]—and the name of the other, Eliezer—For the God of my father has been my help, and has delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.

\[7]And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other [after] their welfare, and went into the tent.
\[8]And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake; all the trouble that had befallen them on the way, and [how] Jehovah had delivered them.
\[9]And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness that Jehovah had done to Israel; that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
\[10]And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

\[16]When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between one and another; and I make known [to them] the statutes of God, and his laws.

\[18]Thou wilt be quite exhausted, both thou and this people that is with thee; for the thing is too heavy for thee: thou canst not perform it alone.
\[19]Hearken now to my voice: I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee. Be thou for the people with God, and bring the matters before God;
\[20]and teach them the statutes and the laws, and make known to them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.

\[22]that they may judge the people at all times; and it shall be [that] they shall bring to thee every great matter, and that they shall judge every small matter, and they shall lighten [the task] on thee, and they shall bear [it] with thee.
\[23]If thou do this thing, and God command thee [so], thou wilt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.
\[24]And Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.
\[25]And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens.

\[2]they departed from Rephidim, and came [into] the wilderness of Sinai, and encamped in the wilderness; and Israel encamped there before the mountain.
\[3]And Moses went up to God, and Jehovah called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:
\[4]Ye have seen what I have done to the Egyptians, and [how] I have borne you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.
\[5]And now, if ye will hearken to my voice indeed and keep my covenant, then shall ye be my own possession out of all the peoples—for all the earth is mine—
\[6]and ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak to the children of Israel.
\[7]And Moses came and called the elders of the people, and laid before the mall these words which Jehovah had commanded him.
\[8]And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah has spoken will we do! And Moses brought the words of the people back to Jehovah.
\[9]And Jehovah said to Moses, Lo, I will come to thee in the cloud's thick darkness, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee also for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to Jehovah.
\[10]And Jehovah said to Moses, Go to the people, and hallow them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their clothes;
\[11]and let them be ready for the third day; for on the third day Jehovah will come down before the eyes of all the people on mount Sinai.
\[12]And set bounds round about the people, saying, Take heed to yourselves, [not] to go up unto the mountain nor touch the border of it: whatever toucheth the mountain shall certainly be put to death:
\[13]not a hand shall touch it, but it shall certainly be stoned, or shot through; whether it be a beast or a man, it shall not live. When the long drawn note of the trumpet soundeth, they shall come up to the mountain.
\[14]And Moses came down from the mountain to the people, and hallowed the people; and they washed their clothes.
\[15]And he said to the people, Be ready for the third day; do not come near [your] wives.
\[16]And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings and a heavy cloud on the mountain, and the sound of the trumpet exceeding loud; and the whole people that was in the camp trembled.
\[17]And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
\[18]And the whole of mount Sinai smoked, because Jehovah descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended as the smoke of a furnace; and the whole mountain shook greatly.
\[19]And the sound of the trumpet increased and became exceeding loud; Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.
\[20]And Jehovah came down on mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain; and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
\[21]And Jehovah said to Moses, Go down, testify to the people that they break not through to Jehovah to gaze, and many of them perish.
\[22]And the priests also, who come near to Jehovah, shall hallow themselves, lest Jehovah break forth on them.
\[23]And Moses said to Jehovah, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai; for thou hast testified to us, saying, Set bounds about the mountain, and hallow it.
\[24]And Jehovah said to him, Go, descend, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee; but the priests and the people shall not break through to go up to Jehovah, lest he break forth on them.

\[4]Thou shalt not make thyself any graven image, or any form of what is in the heavens above, or what is in the earth beneath, or what is in the waters under the earth:
\[5]thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them; for I, Jehovah thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and to the fourth [generation] of them that hate me,
\[6]and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
\[7]Thou shalt not idly utter the name of Jehovah thy God; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that idly uttereth his name.
\[8]Remember the sabbath day to hallow it.
\[9]Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work;
\[10]but the seventh day is the sabbath of Jehovah thy God: thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy bondman, nor thy handmaid, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates.
\[11]For in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore Jehovah blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
\[12]Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be prolonged in the land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee.
\[13]Thou shalt not kill.
\[14]Thou shalt not commit adultery.
\[15]Thou shalt not steal.
\[16]Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
\[17]Thou shalt not desire thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not desire thy neighbour's wife, nor his bondman, nor his handmaid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbour's.
\[18]And all the people saw the thunderings, and the flames, and the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw [it], they trembled, and stood afar off,
\[19]and said to Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
\[20]And Moses said to the people, Fear not; for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before you, that ye sin not.
\[21]And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near to the obscurity where God was.
\[22]And Jehovah said to Moses, Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: Ye have seen that I have spoken with you from the heavens.
\[23]Ye shall not make beside me gods of silver, and ye shall not make to you gods of gold.
\[24]An altar of earth shalt thou make unto me, and shalt sacrifice on it thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep and thine oxen: in all places where I shall make my name to be remembered, I will come unto thee, and bless thee.
\[25]And if thou make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone; for if thou lift up thy sharp tool upon it, thou hast profaned it.

\[2]If thou buy a Hebrew bondman, six years shall he serve; and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
\[3]If he came in alone, he shall go out alone: if he had a wife, then his wife shall go out with him.
\[4]If his master have given him a wife, and she have borne him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out alone.
\[5]But if the bondman shall say distinctly, I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go free;
\[6]then his master shall bring him before the judges, and shall bring him to the door, or to the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall be his bondman for ever.
\[7]And if a man shall sell his daughter as a handmaid, she shall not go out as the bondmen go out.
\[8]If she is unacceptable in the eyes of her master, who had taken her for himself, then shall he let her be ransomed: to sell her unto a foreign people he hath no power, after having dealt unfaithfully with her.
\[9]And if he have appointed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the law of daughters.
\[10]If he take himself another, her food, her clothing, and her conjugal rights he shall not diminish.
\[11]And if he do not these three things unto her, then shall she go out free without money.
\[12]He that striketh a man, so that he die, shall certainly be put to death.
\[13]But if he have not lain in wait, and God have delivered [him] into his hand, I will appoint thee a place to which he shall flee.
\[14]But if a man act wantonly toward his neighbour, and slay him with guile, thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.
\[15]And he that striketh his father, or his mother, shall certainly be put to death.
\[16]And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall certainly be put to death.
\[17]And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall certainly be put to death.
\[18]And if men dispute, and one strike the other with a stone, or with the fist, and he die not, but take to [his] bed,
\[19]—if he rise, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that struck [him] be guiltless; only he shall pay [for] the loss of his time, and shall cause [him] to be thoroughly healed.
\[20]And if a man strike his bondman or his handmaid with a staff, and he die under his hand, he shall certainly be avenged.
\[21]Only, if he continue [to live] a day or two days, he shall not be avenged; for he is his money.
\[22]And if men strive together, and strike a woman with child, so that she be delivered, and no mischief happen, he shall in any case be fined, according as the woman's husband shall impose on him, and shall give it as the judges estimate.
\[23]But if mischief happen, then thou shalt give life for life,
\[24]eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
\[25]branding for branding, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
\[26]And if a man strike the eye of his bondman or the eye of his handmaid, and it be marred, he shall let him go for his eye.

\[21]Be careful in his presence, and hearken unto his voice: do not provoke him, for he will not forgive your transgressions; for my name is in him.

\[29]I will not drive them out from before thee in one year: lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.
\[30]By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou art fruitful, and possess the land.
\[31]And I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the river; for I will give the inhabitants of the land into your hand, that thou mayest dispossess them from before thee.
\[32]Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

\[12]And Jehovah said to Moses, Come up to me into the mountain, and be there; and I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law, and the commandment that I have written, for their instruction.
\[13]And Moses rose up, and Joshua his attendant; and Moses went up to the mountain of God.

\[30]And thou shalt put into the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim, that they may be upon Aaron's heart when he goeth in before Jehovah; and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before Jehovah continually.
\[31]And thou shalt make the cloak of the ephod all of blue.
\[32]And its opening for the head shall be in the midst thereof; there shall be a binding of woven work at its opening round about; as the opening of a coat of mail, it shall be in it—it shall not rend.
\[33]And on the skirts thereof thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, round about the skirts thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:
\[34]a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, in the skirts of the cloak round about.
\[35]And it shall be on Aaron for service; that his sound may be heard when he goeth into the sanctuary before Jehovah, and when he cometh out, that he may not die.
\[36]And thou shalt make a thin plate of pure gold, and engrave on it, as the engravings of a seal, Holiness to Jehovah!
\[37]And thou shalt put it on a lace of blue, and it shall be upon the turban—upon the front of the turban shall it be.
\[38]And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, and Aaron shall bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all gifts of their holy things; and it shall be continually on his forehead, that they may be accepted before Jehovah.
\[39]And thou shalt weave the vest of byssus; and thou shalt make a turban of byssus; and thou shalt make a girdle of embroidery.
\[40]And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make vests; and thou shalt make for them girdles; and high caps shalt thou make for them, for glory and for ornament.
\[41]And thou shalt clothe with them Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and hallow them, that they may serve me as priests.
\[42]And thou shalt make them linen trousers to cover the flesh of nakedness; from the loins even to the hips shall they reach.
\[43]And they shall be upon Aaron and his sons when they enter into the tent of meeting, or when they come near to the altar to serve in the sanctuary; that they may not bear iniquity and die—an everlasting statute for him and his seed after him.

\[2]and unleavened bread, and unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil—of wheaten flour shalt thou make them.
\[3]And thou shalt put them into one basket, and present them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.
\[4]And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring near the entrance of the tent of meeting, and shalt bathe them with water.
\[5]And thou shalt take the garments, and clothe Aaron with the vest, and the cloak of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and shalt gird him with the girdle of the ephod.

\[9]And thou shalt gird them with the girdle—Aaron and his sons, and bind the high caps on them; and the priesthood shall be theirs for an everlasting statute; and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons.
\[10]And thou shalt present the bullock before the tent of meeting; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock;
\[11]and thou shalt slaughter the bullock before Jehovah, at the entrance of the tent of meeting;
\[12]and thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it on the horns of the altar with thy finger, and shalt pour all the blood at the bottom of the altar.
\[13]And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the net of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.
\[14]And the flesh of the bullock, and its skin, and its dung, shalt thou burn with fire outside the camp: it is a sin-offering.
\[15]And thou shalt take one of the rams, and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram;
\[16]and thou shalt slaughter the ram, and shalt take its blood, and sprinkle [it] on the altar round about.
\[17]And thou shalt cut up the ram into its pieces, and wash its inwards, and its legs, and put [them] upon its pieces, and upon its head;
\[18]and thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering to Jehovah—a sweet odour; it is an offering by fire to Jehovah.
\[19]And thou shalt take the second ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram;
\[20]and thou shalt slaughter the ram, and take of its blood, and put [it] on the tip of the [right] ear of Aaron, and on the tip of the right ear of his sons, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot; and thou shalt sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
\[21]And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle [it] on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him; and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
\[22]Also of the ram shalt thou take the fat, and the fat-tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the net of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder—for it is a ram of consecration—
\[23]and one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened [bread] that is before Jehovah;

\[25]And thou shalt receive them of their hand and burn [them] upon the altar over the burnt-offering, for a sweet odour before Jehovah: it is an offering by fire to Jehovah.
\[26]And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of consecration which is for Aaron, and wave it as a wave-offering before Jehovah; and it shall be thy part.
\[27]And thou shalt hallow the breast of the wave-offering, and the shoulder of the heave-offering, that hath been waved and heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, of that which is for Aaron, and of [that] which is for his sons.
\[28]And they shall be for Aaron and his sons, as an everlasting statute, on the part of the children of Israel; for it is a heave-offering; and it shall be a heave-offering on the part of the children of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, [as] their heave-offering to Jehovah.
\[29]And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.
\[30]The son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tent of meeting to serve in the sanctuary.
\[31]And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and boil its flesh in a holy place.
\[32]And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
\[33]They shall eat the things with which the atonement was made, to consecrate [and] to hallow them; but a stranger shall not eat [of them], for they are holy.
\[34]And if [any] of the flesh of the consecration, and of the bread, remain until the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, for it is holy.
\[35]And thus shalt thou do to Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.
\[36]And thou shalt offer every day a bullock as a sin-offering for atonement; and the altar shalt thou cleanse from sin, by making atonement for it, and shalt anoint it, to hallow it.
\[37]Seven days shalt thou make atonement for the altar and hallow it; and the altar shall be most holy: whatever toucheth the altar shall be holy.
\[38]And this is what thou shalt offer upon the altar—two lambs of the first year, day by day continually.
\[39]The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer between the two evenings.
\[40]And with the one lamb a tenth part of wheaten flour mingled with beaten oil, a fourth part of a hin; and a drink-offering, a fourth part of a hin of wine.
\[41]And the second lamb shalt thou offer between the two evenings; as the oblation in the morning, and as its drink-offering shalt thou offer with this, for a sweet odour, an offering by fire to Jehovah.
\[42]It shall be a continual burnt-offering throughout your generations at the entrance of the tent of meeting before Jehovah, where I will meet with you, to speak there with thee.
\[43]And there will I meet with the children of Israel; and it shall be hallowed by my glory.
\[44]And I will hallow the tent of meeting, and the altar; and I will hallow Aaron and his sons, that they may serve me as priests.
\[45]And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and will be their God.

\[10]And Aaron shall make atonement for its horns once in the year: with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement shall he make atonement for it, once in the year, throughout your generations: it is most holy to Jehovah.
\[11]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[12]When thou shalt take the sum of the children of Israel according to those of them that are numbered, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to Jehovah on their being numbered, that there be no plague among them on their being numbered.
\[13]This shall they give—every one that passeth among them that are numbered—half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary,—twenty gerahs the shekel; a half shekel shall be the heave-offering for Jehovah.
\[14]Every one that passeth among those that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give the heave-offering of Jehovah.
\[15]The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when ye give the heave-offering of Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.
\[16]And thou shalt take the atonement-money of the children of Israel, and devote it to the service of the tent of meeting; and it shall be a memorial to the children of Israel before Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.
\[17]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[18]Thou shalt also make a laver of copper, and its stand of copper, for washing; and thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shalt put water in it.
\[19]And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet out of it.
\[20]When they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they may not die; or when they come near to the altar to serve, to burn an offering by fire to Jehovah.
\[21]And they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they may not die; and it shall be an everlasting statute for them, for him and for his seed throughout their generations.
\[22]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[23]And thou, take best spices—of liquid myrrh five hundred [shekels], and of sweet cinnamon the half—two hundred and fifty, and of sweet myrtle two hundred and fifty,
\[24]and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin;
\[25]and make of it an oil of holy ointment, a perfume of perfumery after the work of the perfumer: it shall be the holy anointing oil.

\[27]and the table and all its utensils, and the lamp-stand and its utensils, and the altar of incense,
\[28]and the altar of burnt-offering and all its utensils, and the laver and its stand.

\[30]And Aaron and his sons thou shalt anoint, and shalt hallow them, that they may serve me as priests.
\[31]And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel, saying, A holy anointing oil shall this be unto me throughout your generations.
\[32]Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make [any] like it, after the preparation of it: it is holy—holy shall it be unto you.
\[33]Whoever compoundeth [any] like it, or whoever putteth [any] of it upon any strange thing, shall be cut off from his peoples.
\[34]And Jehovah said to Moses, Take fragrant drugs—stacte, and onycha, and galbanum—fragrant drugs and pure frankincense; in like proportions shall it be.
\[35]And thou shalt make it into incense, a perfume, after the work of the perfumer, salted, pure, holy.
\[36]And thou shalt beat [some] of it to powder, and put [some] of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.

\[4]to devise artistic work—to work in gold, and in silver, and in copper,
\[5]and in cutting of stones, for setting, and for carving of timber—to work in all manner of work.
\[6]And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of every one that is wise-hearted have I given wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee—

\[14]Keep the sabbath, therefore; for it is holy unto you; every one that profaneth it shall certainly be put to death: yea, whoever doeth work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his peoples.
\[15]Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, holy to Jehovah: whoever doeth work on the sabbath day shall certainly be put to death.
\[16]And the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations—[it is] an everlasting covenant.

nd when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people collected together to Aaron, and said to him, Up, make us a god, who will go before us; for this Moses, the man that has brought us up out of the land of Egypt,—we do not know what is become of him!
\[2]And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden rings that are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring [them] to me.
\[3]Then all the people broke off the golden rings that were in their ears, and brought [them] to Aaron.
\[4]And he took [them] out of their hand, and fashioned it with a chisel and made of it a molten calf: and they said, This is thy god, Israel, who has brought thee up out of the land of Egypt!
\[5]And Aaron saw [it], and built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, To-morrow is a feast to Jehovah!
\[6]And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered up burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to sport.
\[7]Then Jehovah said to Moses, Away, go down! for thy people, which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, is acting corruptly.
\[8]They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them: they have made themselves a molten calf, and have bowed down to it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, This is thy god, Israel, who has brought thee up out of the land of Egypt!
\[9]And Jehovah said to Moses, I see this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.
\[10]And now let me alone, that my anger may burn against them, and I may consume them; and I will make of thee a great nation.
\[11]And Moses besought Jehovah his God, and said, Why, Jehovah, doth thy wrath burn against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand?
\[12]Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For misfortune he has brought them out, to slay them on the mountains, and to annihilate them from the face of the earth? Turn from the heat of thine anger, and repent of this evil against thy people!
\[13]Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou sworest by thyself, and saidst to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall possess [it] for ever!
\[14]And Jehovah repented of the evil that he had said he would do to his people.
\[15]And Moses turned and went down from the mountain, [with] the two tables of the testimony in his hand—tables written on both their sides: on this side and on that were they written.
\[16]And the tables [were] God's work, and the writing was God's writing, engraven on the tables.
\[17]And Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, and said to Moses, There is a shout of war in the camp.
\[18]And he said, It is not the sound of a shout of victory, neither is it the sound of a shout of defeat: it is the noise of alternate singing I hear.
\[19]And it came to pass, when he came near the camp, and saw the calf and the dancing, that Moses' anger burned, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and shattered them beneath the mountain.
\[20]And he took the calf that they had made, and burned [it] with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed [it] on the water, and made the children of Israel drink [it].
\[21]And Moses said to Aaron, What has this people done to thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin on them?
\[22]And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord burn! thou knowest the people, that they are [set] on mischief.
\[23]And they said to me, Make us a god, who will go before us; for this Moses, the man that has brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what is become of him!
\[24]And I said to them, Who has gold? They broke [it] off, and gave [it] me, and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.
\[25]And Moses saw the people how they were stripped; for Aaron had stripped them to [their] shame before their adversaries.
\[26]And Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, He that is for Jehovah, [let him come] to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered to him.
\[27]And he said to them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Put every man his sword upon his hip; go and return from gate to gate through the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his friend, and every man his neighbour.
\[28]And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
\[29]And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to Jehovah, yea, every man with his son, and with his brother, and bring on yourselves a blessing to-day.
\[30]And it came to pass the next day, that Moses said to the people, Ye have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to Jehovah: perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin.
\[31]And Moses returned to Jehovah, and said, Alas, this people has sinned a great sin, and they have made themselves a god of gold!
\[32]And now, if thou wilt forgive their sin … but if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book that thou hast written.
\[33]And Jehovah said to Moses, Whoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
\[34]And now go, lead the people whither I have told thee: behold, my Angel shall go before thee; but in the day of my visiting I will visit their sin upon them.
\[35]And Jehovah smote the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron had made.

\[2](and I will send an angel before thee, and dispossess the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite,)
\[3]into a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiff-necked people,—lest I consume thee on the way.
\[4]And when the people heard this evil word, they mourned; and no man put on his ornaments.
\[5]Now Jehovah had said to Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiff-necked people: in one moment I will come up into the midst of thee and will consume thee. And now put off thine ornaments from thee, and I will know what I will do unto thee.
\[6]And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments at mount Horeb.
\[7]And Moses took the tent, and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and called it the Tent of meeting. And it came to pass [that] every one who sought Jehovah went out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp.
\[8]And it came to pass, when Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose up, and stood every man at the entrance of his tent, and they looked after Moses until he entered into the tent.
\[9]And it came to pass when Moses entered into the tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the entrance of the tent, and [Jehovah] talked with Moses.
\[10]And all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent; and all the people rose and worshipped, every man at the entrance of his tent.
\[11]And Jehovah spoke with Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend. And he returned to the camp; but his attendant, Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, departed not from within the tent.
\[12]And Moses said to Jehovah, Behold, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people; but thou dost not let me know whom thou wilt send with me; and thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in mine eyes.
\[13]And now, if indeed I have found grace in thine eyes, make me now to know thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thine eyes; and consider that this nation is thy people!
\[14]And he said, My presence shall go, and I will give thee rest.
\[15]And he said to him, If thy presence do not go, bring us not up hence.
\[16]And how shall it be known then that I have found grace in thine eyes—I and thy people? [Is it] not by thy going with us? so shall we be distinguished, I and thy people, from every people that is on the face of the earth.
\[17]And Jehovah said to Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast said; for thou hast found grace in mine eyes, and I know thee by name.
\[18]And he said, Let me, I pray thee, see thy glory.
\[19]And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thy face, and I will proclaim the name of Jehovah before thee; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.
\[20]And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for Man shall not see me, and live.
\[21]And Jehovah said, Behold, [there is] a place by me: there shalt thou stand on the rock.
\[22]And it shall come to pass, when my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand, until I have passed by.

\[3]And let no man go up with thee, neither shall any man be seen on all the mountain; neither shall sheep and oxen feed in front of that mountain.
\[4]And he hewed two tables of stone like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.
\[5]And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and stood beside him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.
\[6]And Jehovah passed by before his face, and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in goodness and truth,
\[7]keeping mercy unto thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but by no means clearing [the guilty]; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, upon the third and upon the fourth [generation].
\[8]And Moses made haste, and bowed his head to the earth and worshipped,
\[9]and said, If indeed I have found grace in thine eyes, Lord, let the Lord, I pray thee, go in our midst; for it is a stiff-necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for an inheritance!
\[10]And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels that have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people in the midst of which thou [art] shall see the work of Jehovah; for a terrible thing it shall be that I will do with thee.
\[11]Observe what I command thee this day: behold, I will drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
\[12]Take heed to thyself, that thou make no covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which thou shalt come, lest it be a snare in the midst of thee;
\[13]but ye shall demolish their altars, shatter their statues, and hew down their Asherahs.
\[14]For thou shalt worship no other God; for Jehovah—Jealous is his name—is a jealous God;
\[15]lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and then, when they go a whoring after their gods, and sacrifice unto their gods, thou be invited, and eat of their sacrifice,
\[16]and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.

\[18]—The feast of the unleavened bread shalt thou keep: seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I have commanded thee, at the appointed time of the month Abib; for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.
\[19]—All that openeth the womb [is] mine; and all the cattle that is born a male, the firstling of ox and sheep.
\[20]But the firstling of an ass thou shalt ransom with a lamb; and if thou ransom [it] not, then shalt thou break its neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt ransom; and none shall appear before me empty.
\[21]—Six days shalt thou work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; in ploughing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.
\[22]—And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the first-fruits of wheat-harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the turn of the year.
\[23]Thrice in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord Jehovah, the God of Israel.
\[24]For I will dispossess the nations before thee, and enlarge thy border, and no man shall desire thy land, when thou goest up to appear before the face of Jehovah thy God thrice in the year.
\[25]—Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left over night until the morning.
\[26]—The first of the first-fruits of thy land shalt thou bring into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk.
\[27]And Jehovah said to Moses, Write thee these words; for after the tenor of these words have I made a covenant with thee and with Israel.
\[28]—And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he ate no bread, and drank no water.—And he wrote on the tables the words of the covenant, the ten words.
\[29]And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai—and the two tables of testimony were in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mountain—that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone through his talking with him.
\[30]And Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, and behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him.
\[31]And Moses called to them; and they turned to him,—Aaron and all the principal men of the assembly; and Moses talked with them.
\[32]And afterwards, all the children of Israel came near; and he gave them in commandment all that Jehovah had spoken with him on mount Sinai.
\[33]And Moses ended speaking with them; and he had put on his face a veil.
\[34]And when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spoke to the children of Israel what he was commanded.
\[35]And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone; and Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

\[2]Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of rest to Jehovah: whoever does work on it shall be put to death.
\[3]Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your dwellings upon the sabbath day.
\[4]And Moses spoke to all the assembly of the children of Israel, saying, This is the word which Jehovah has commanded, saying,
\[5]Take from among you a heave-offering to Jehovah: every one whose heart [is] willing, let him bring it, Jehovah's heave-offering—gold, and silver, and copper,
\[6]and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and byssus, and goats' [hair],
\[7]and rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and acacia-wood,
\[8]and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the incense of fragrant drugs;
\[9]and onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.
\[10]And all who are wise-hearted among you shall come and make all that Jehovah has commanded:
\[11]the tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its clasps, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its bases;
\[12]the ark, and its staves; the mercy-seat, and the veil of separation;
\[13]the table and its staves, and all its utensils, and the shewbread;

\[20]And all the assembly of the children of Israel departed from before Moses.
\[21]And they came, every one whose heart moved him, and every one whose spirit prompted him; they brought Jehovah's heave-offering for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all its service, and for the holy garments.
\[22]And they came, both men and women; every one who was of willing heart brought nose-rings, and earrings, and rings, and bracelets, all kinds of utensils of gold: every man that waved a wave-offering of gold to Jehovah.
\[23]And every man with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and byssus, and goats' [hair], and rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, brought [them].
\[24]All they that offered a heave-offering of silver and copper brought Jehovah's heave-offering. And every one with whom was found acacia-wood for all manner of work of the service, brought [it].
\[25]And every woman that was wise-hearted spun with her hands, and brought what she had spun: the blue, and the purple, and the scarlet, and the byssus.

\[29]The children of Israel brought a voluntary offering to Jehovah, every man and woman whose heart prompted them to bring for all manner of work, which Jehovah, by the hand of Moses, had commanded to be done.
\[30]And Moses said to the children of Israel, See, Jehovah has called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
\[31]and he has filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
\[32]and to devise artistic things: to work in gold, and in silver, and in copper,
\[33]and in cutting of stones, for setting, and in carving of wood, to execute all artistic work;
\[34]and he has put in his heart to teach, he and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan:
\[35]he has filled them with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work of the engraver, and of the artificer, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in byssus, and of the weaver, [even] of them that do every kind of work, and of those that devise artistic work

\[2]And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every man that was wise-hearted, in whose heart God had put wisdom, every one whose heart moved him to come to the work to do it.
\[3]And they took from Moses every heave-offering that the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it. And they still brought him voluntary offerings morning by morning.
\[4]And all the wise men that wrought all the work of the sanctuary came, every man from his work which they wrought,
\[5]and spoke to Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work that Jehovah commanded to be done.
\[6]Then Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed through the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the heave-offering of the sanctuary! So the people were restrained from bringing;
\[7]for the work they had was sufficient for all the work to do it, and it was too much.
\[8]And every wise-hearted man among those that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of twined byssus, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: [with] cherubim of artistic work did he make them.
\[9]The length of one curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits—one measure for all the curtains.
\[10]And he coupled five of the curtains one to another, and [the other] five curtains coupled he one to another.

\[22]two tenons in one board, connected one with the other: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

\[32]and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle at the rear, westward.
\[33]And he made the middle bar in the midst of the boards reach from one end to the other.
\[34]And he overlaid the boards with gold; and made their rings of gold [as] receptacles for the bars; and overlaid the bars with gold.
\[35]And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined byssus: of artistic work he made it [with] cherubim.
\[36]And he made four pillars of acacia[-wood] for it, and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four bases of silver.

\[2]On the day of the first month, on the first of the month, shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
\[3]And thou shalt put in it the ark of the testimony, and shalt cover the ark with the veil.
\[4]And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it. And thou shalt bring in the candlestick and light its lamps.
\[5]And thou shalt set the golden altar for the incense before the ark of the testimony; and hang up the curtain of the entrance to the tabernacle.
\[6]And thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
\[7]And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shalt put water in it.
\[8]And thou shalt fix the court round about, and hang up the curtain at the gate of the court.
\[9]And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is in it, and shalt hallow it, and all its utensils; and it shall be holy.
\[10]And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering, and all its utensils; and thou shalt hallow the altar, and the altar shall be most holy.
\[11]And thou shalt anoint the laver and its stand, and hallow it.
\[12]And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons near, at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and bathe them with water.
\[13]And thou shalt clothe Aaron with the holy garments, and anoint him, and hallow him, that he may serve me as priest.
\[14]And thou shalt bring his sons near, and clothe them with vests.
\[15]And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may serve me as priests. And their anointing shall be to them an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.
\[16]And Moses did so: as Jehovah had commanded him, so did he.
\[17]And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first of the month, that the tabernacle was set up.
\[18]And Moses set up the tabernacle, and put in its bases, and fixed its boards, and put in its bars, and set up its pillars.
\[19]And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above over it; as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
\[20]And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and put the staves in the ark, and put the mercy-seat above on the ark.
\[21]And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and hung up the veil of separation, and covered the ark of the testimony; as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
\[22]And he put the table in the tent of meeting, on the side of the tabernacle northward, outside the veil,
\[23]and arranged the bread in order upon it before Jehovah; as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
\[24]And he put the candlestick in the tent of meeting, opposite to the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.
\[25]And he lighted the lamps before Jehovah; as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
\[26]And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil.
\[27]And he burnt on it fragrant incense; as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
\[28]And he hung up the curtain of the entrance to the tabernacle.
\[29]And he put the altar of burnt-offering at the entrance to the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt-offering and the oblation; as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
\[30]And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it for washing.
\[31]And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet out of it:
\[32]when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they drew near to the altar, they washed; as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
\[33]And he set up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and hung up the curtain of the gate of the court. And so Moses finished the work.
\[34]And the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.
\[35]And Moses could not enter into the tent of meeting, for the cloud abode on it, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.
\[36]And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel journeyed in all their journeys.
\[37]And if the cloud were not taken up, then they did not journey until the day that it was taken up.
\[38]For the cloud of Jehovah was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was in it by night, before the eyes of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.

\[23]and one slaughtered [it]; and Moses took of its blood, and put [it] on the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot;
\[24]and he brought Aaron's sons near, and Moses put of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
\[25]And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the inwards, and the net of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and the right shoulder;
\[26]and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before Jehovah he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat and upon the right shoulder;
\[27]and he gave all into Aaron's hands, and into his sons' hands, and waved them as a wave-offering before Jehovah.
\[28]And Moses took them from off their hands, and burned [them] on the altar, over the burnt-offering: they were a consecration-offering for a sweet odour: it was an offering by fire to Jehovah.
\[29]And Moses took the breast, and waved it as a wave-offering before Jehovah; of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
\[30]And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood that was on the altar, and sprinkled [it] on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons' garments with him; and hallowed Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
\[31]And Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting; and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of the consecration-offering, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
\[32]And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.
\[33]And ye shall not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting seven days, until the day when the days of your consecration are at an end: for seven days shall ye be consecrated.
\[34]As he hath done this day, [so] Jehovah hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you.
\[35]And ye shall abide at the entrance of the tent of meeting day and night seven days, and keep the charge of Jehovah, that ye die not; for so I am commanded.

\[2]and said to Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and present [them] before Jehovah;
\[3]and to the children of Israel shalt thou speak, saying, Take a buck of the goats for a sin-offering, and a calf and a lamb, yearlings, without blemish, for a burnt-offering;
\[4]and a bullock and a ram for a peace-offering, to sacrifice before Jehovah; and an oblation mingled with oil; for to-day Jehovah will appear to you.
\[5]And they brought what Moses commanded before the tent of meeting; and all the assembly approached and stood before Jehovah.
\[6]And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded that ye should do; and the glory of Jehovah shall appear to you.
\[7]And Moses said unto Aaron, Go to the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as Jehovah has commanded.
\[8]And Aaron went to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin-offering which was for himself;
\[9]and the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put [it] on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar.
\[10]And the fat, and the kidneys, and the net above the liver, of the sin-offering, he burned on the altar, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
\[11]And the flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.
\[12]And he slaughtered the burnt-offering; and Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled on the altar round about.
\[13]And they delivered the burnt-offering to him, in the pieces thereof, and the head; and he burned [them] on the altar.
\[14]And he washed the inwards and the legs, and burned [them] upon the burnt-offering, on the altar.
\[15]And he presented the people's offering, and took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people and slaughtered it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
\[16]And he presented the burnt-offering and offered it according to the ordinance.
\[17]And he presented the oblation, and took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning.
\[18]And he slaughtered the bullock and the ram of the sacrifice of peace-offering which was for the people. And Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, and he sprinkled it on the altar round about;
\[19]and the pieces of fat of the bullock and of the ram, the fat tail and what covers [the inwards], and the kidneys, and the net of the liver;
\[20]and they put the pieces of fat on the breast-pieces, and he burned the pieces of fat on the altar;
\[21]and the breast-pieces and the right shoulder Aaron waved as a wave-offering before Jehovah, as Moses had commanded.
\[22]And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and came down after the offering of the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offering.
\[23]And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out and blessed the people; and the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the people.
\[24]And there went out fire from before Jehovah, and consumed on the altar the burnt-offering, and the pieces of fat; and all the people saw it, and they shouted, and fell on their face.

\[2]And there went out fire from before Jehovah, and devoured them, and they died before Jehovah.
\[3]And Moses said to Aaron, This is what Jehovah spoke, saying, I will be hallowed in them that come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron was silent.
\[4]And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
\[5]And they went near, and carried them in their vests out of the camp, as Moses had said.
\[6]And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar his sons, Your heads shall ye not uncover, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come on all the assembly; but your brethren, the whole house of Israel, shall bewail the burning which Jehovah hath kindled.
\[7]And ye shall not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
\[8]And Jehovah spoke to Aaron, saying,
\[9]Thou shalt not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, and thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, lest ye die—[it is] an everlasting statute throughout your generations,
\[10]that ye may put difference between the holy and the unholy, and between unclean and clean,
\[11]and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah hath spoken to them by the hand of Moses.
\[12]And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the oblation that is left of Jehovah's offerings by fire, and eat it with unleavened bread beside the altar; for it is most holy.
\[13]And ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of Jehovah's offerings by fire; for so I am commanded.
\[14]And the breast of the wave-offering, and the shoulder of the heave-offering shall ye eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee; for [as] thy due, and thy sons' due, are they given of the sacrifices of peace-offerings of the children of Israel.
\[15]The shoulder of the heave-offering and the breast of the wave-offering shall they bring, with the fire-offering of the pieces of fat, to wave [them] as a wave-offering before Jehovah; and they shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, for an everlasting statute, as Jehovah has commanded.
\[16]And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and behold, it was burnt up: then he was wroth with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, saying,
\[17]Why have ye not eaten the sin-offering in a holy place? for it is most holy, and he has given it to you that ye might bear the iniquity of the assembly, to make atonement for them before Jehovah.
\[18]Lo, its blood was not brought in within the sanctuary: ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.
\[19]And Aaron said to Moses, Behold, to-day have they presented their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before Jehovah; and such things have befallen me; and had I to-day eaten the sin-offering, would it have been good in the sight of Jehovah?

\[3]And when the priest looketh on the sore in the skin of the flesh, and the hair in the sore is turned white, and the sore looketh deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the sore of leprosy; and the priest shall look on him and pronounce him unclean.
\[4]But if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and look not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white, the priest shall shut up [him that hath] the sore seven days.
\[5]And the priest shall look on him the seventh day; and behold, in his sight, the sore remaineth as it was, the sore hath not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days a second time.
\[6]And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day, and behold, the sore is become pale and the sore hath not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is a scab; and he shall wash his garments and be clean.
\[7]But if the scab have spread much in the skin, after that he hath been seen by the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen by the priest again;
\[8]and the priest shall look on him, and behold, the scab hath spread in the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy.
\[9]When a sore [as] of leprosy is in a man, he shall be brought unto the priest;
\[10]and the priest shall look on him, and behold, there is a white rising in the skin, and it hath turned the hair white, and a trace of raw flesh is in the rising:
\[11]it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh; and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and he shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.

\[31]of what his hand was able to get shall the one be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-offering, with the oblation; and the priest shall make atonement for him that is to be cleansed before Jehovah.
\[32]This is the law for him in whom is the sore of leprosy, whose hand cannot get what is [regularly prescribed] in his cleansing.
\[33]And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
\[34]When ye come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put a leprous plague in a house of the land of your possession,
\[35]then he whose house it is shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me like a plague in the house;
\[36]and the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean; and afterwards the priest shall go in to see the house.
\[37]And when he looketh on the plague, and behold, the plague is in the walls of the house, greenish or reddish hollows, and their look is deeper than the surface of the wall,
\[38]then the priest shall go out of the house to the entrance of the house, and shut up the house seven days.
\[39]And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and when he looketh, and behold, the plague hath spread in the walls of the house,
\[40]then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them out of the city, in an unclean place.
\[41]And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the mortar that they have scraped off, out of the city in an unclean place.
\[42]And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and they shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.
\[43]And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plastered,
\[44]then the priest shall come, and when he looketh, and behold, the plague hath spread in the house, it is a corroding leprosy in the house: it is unclean.
\[45]And they shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house, and shall carry them forth out of the city to an unclean place.
\[46]And he that goeth into the house as long as it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.
\[47]And he that sleepeth in the house shall wash his garments, and he that eateth in the house shall wash his garments.
\[48]But if the priest shall come in and look, and behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house hath been plastered, the priest shall pronounce the house clean; for the plague is healed.
\[49]And he shall take, to purge the house from the defilement, two birds, and cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop;
\[50]and he shall kill one bird in an earthen vessel over running water;
\[51]and he shall take the cedar-wood and the hyssop and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times;
\[52]and he shall purge the house from the defilement with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar-wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet;
\[53]and he shall let the living bird loose out of the city into the open field; and he shall make atonement for the house, and it is clean.
\[54]This is the law for every sore of leprosy, and for the scall,
\[55]and for the leprosy of garments, and of houses,
\[56]and for the rising, and for the scab, and for the bright spot,
\[57]to teach when there is uncleanness, and when it is purified: this is the law of leprosy.

\[2]and Jehovah said to Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the sanctuary inside the veil before the mercy-seat which is upon the ark, that he die not; for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy-seat.
\[3]In this manner shall Aaron come into the sanctuary: with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering.
\[4]A holy linen vest shall he put on, and linen trousers shall be upon his flesh, and he shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and put them on.
\[5]And of the assembly of the children of Israel shall he take two bucks of the goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering.
\[6]And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself, and for his house.
\[7]And he shall take the two goats, and set them before Jehovah, before the entrance of the tent of meeting.
\[8]And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats: one lot for Jehovah, and the other lot for Azazel.
\[9]And Aaron shall present the goat upon which the lot fell for Jehovah, and offer it [as] a sin-offering.
\[10]And the goat upon which the lot fell for Azazel shall be set alive before Jehovah, to make atonement with it, to send it away as Azazel into the wilderness.
\[11]And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house, and shall slaughter the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself.
\[12]And he shall take the censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before Jehovah, and both his hands full of fragrant incense beaten small, and bring it inside the veil.
\[13]And he shall put the incense upon the fire before Jehovah, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat which is upon the testimony, that he die not.
\[14]And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle with his finger upon the front of the mercy-seat eastward; and before the mercy-seat shall he sprinkle of the blood seven times with his finger.
\[15]And he shall slaughter the goat of the sin-offering, which is for the people, and bring its blood inside the veil, and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat;
\[16]and he shall make atonement for the sanctuary, [to cleanse it] from the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and from their transgressions in all their sins; and so shall he do for the tent of meeting which dwelleth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
\[17]And there shall be no man in the tent of meeting when he goeth in to make atonement in the sanctuary until he come out; and he shall make atonement for himself, and for his house, and for the whole congregation of Israel.
\[18]And he shall go out unto the altar which is before Jehovah, and make atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about;

\[22]that the goat may bear upon him all their iniquities to a land apart [from men]; and he shall send away the goat into the wilderness.
\[23]And Aaron shall go into the tent of meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the sanctuary, and shall leave them there;
\[24]and he shall bathe his flesh with water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and go forth, and offer his burnt-offering, and the burnt-offering of the people, and make atonement for himself, and for the people.
\[25]And the fat of the sin-offering shall he burn upon the altar.
\[26]And he that letteth go the goat for Azazel shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water; and afterwards he may come into the camp.
\[27]And the bullock of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the sanctuary, shall one carry forth outside the camp; and they shall burn with fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.
\[28]And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water; and afterwards he may come into the camp.
\[29]And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you. In the seventh month, on the tenth of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, the home-born, and the stranger that sojourneth among you;
\[30]for on that day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you: from all your sins shall ye be clean before Jehovah.

\[10]And every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood,—I will set my face against the soul that hath eaten blood, and will cut him off from among his people;
\[11]for the soul of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that maketh atonement for the soul.
\[12]Therefore have I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall the stranger who sojourneth among you eat blood.
\[13]And every one of the children of Israel, and of the strangers who sojourn among them, that catcheth in the hunt a beast or fowl that may be eaten, he shall pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with earth;
\[14]for as to the life of all flesh, its blood is the life in it; and I have said unto the children of Israel, Of the blood of no manner of flesh shall ye eat, for the life of all flesh is its blood: whoever eateth it shall be cut off.
\[15]And every soul that eateth of a dead carcase, or of that which was torn, be it one home-born, or a stranger, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the even: then he shall be clean.

\[19]And the nakedness of thy mother's sister, and of thy father's sister shalt thou not uncover; for he hath laid naked his near relation: they shall bear their iniquity.

\[21]And if a man take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness: they shall be childless.
\[22]And ye shall observe all my statutes, and all mine ordinances, and do them, that the land whither I bring you to dwell therein vomit you not out.
\[23]And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation which I am casting out before you; for all these things have they done, and they became an abomination to me.
\[24]And I have said unto you, Ye shall possess their land, and I will give it unto you for a possession; a land flowing with milk and honey: I am Jehovah your God, who have separated you from the peoples.
\[25]And ye shall make a separation between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean, and ye shall not make yourselves an abomination by beast, or by fowl, or by anything that creepeth on the ground which I have separated for you, declaring [it] as unclean.

\[2]except for his immediate relation, who is near unto him—for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother;
\[3]and for his sister, a virgin, that is near unto him, who hath had no husband, for her may he make himself unclean.
\[4]He shall not make himself unclean [who is] a chief among his peoples, to profane himself.
\[5]They shall not make any baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
\[6]They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God; for they present Jehovah's offerings by fire, the bread of their God; therefore shall they be holy.
\[7]They shall not take as wife a whore, or a dishonoured woman; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband; for he is holy unto his God.
\[8]And thou shalt hallow him; for the bread of thy God doth he present: he shall be holy unto thee; for I, Jehovah, who hallow you am holy.
\[9]And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burned with fire.
\[10]And the high priest among his brethren, on whose head the anointing oil was poured, and who is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his garments.
\[11]Neither shall he come near any person dead, nor make himself unclean for his father and for his mother;
\[12]neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am Jehovah.
\[13]And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
\[14]A widow, or a divorced woman, or a dishonoured one, a harlot, these shall he not take; but he shall take as wife a virgin from among his peoples.
\[15]And he shall not profane his seed among his peoples; for I am Jehovah who do hallow him.
\[16]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[17]Speak unto Aaron, saying, Any of thy seed throughout their generations that hath any defect, shall not approach to present the bread of his God;
\[18]for whatever man hath a defect, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or one limb longer than the other,
\[19]or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed,
\[20]or hump-backed, or withered, or that hath a spot in his eye, or hath the itch, or scabs, or his testicles broken.
\[21]No man of the seed of Aaron the priest that hath defect shall come near to present Jehovah's offerings by fire: he hath a defect; he shall not come near to present the bread of his God.
\[22]The bread of his God, of the most holy and of the holy, shall he eat;

\[16]even unto the morning after the seventh sabbath shall ye count fifty days; and ye shall present a new oblation to Jehovah.
\[17]Out of your dwellings shall ye bring two wave-loaves, of two tenths of fine flour; with leaven shall they be baken; [as] first-fruits to Jehovah.

\[4]but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest for the land, a sabbath to Jehovah. Thy field shalt thou not sow, and thy vineyard shalt thou not prune.
\[5]That which springeth up from the scattered seed of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of thine undressed vines thou shalt not gather: a year of rest shall it be for the land.
\[6]And the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you, for thee, and for thy bondman, and for thy handmaid, and for thy hired servant, and for him that dwelleth as a sojourner with thee, and for thy cattle,
\[7]and for the beasts that are in thy land: all the produce thereof shall be for food.
\[8]And thou shalt count seven sabbaths of years, seven times seven years; so that the days of the seven sabbaths of years be unto thee forty-nine years.
\[9]Then shalt thou cause the loud sound of the trumpet to go forth in the seventh month, on the tenth of the month; on the day of atonement shall ye cause the trumpet to go forth throughout your land.

\[13]In this year of the jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession.
\[14]And if ye sell ought unto your neighbour, or buy of your neighbour's hand, ye shall not overreach one another.
\[15]According to the number of years since the jubilee, thou shalt buy of thy neighbour; according to the number of years of the produce, he shall sell unto thee.
\[16]According to the greater number of the years, thou shalt increase the price thereof; and according to the fewness of years, thou shalt diminish the price of it; for it is the number of crops that he selleth unto thee.

\[30]But if it be not redeemed until a whole year is complete, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubilee.

\[41]Then shall he depart from thee, he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.

\[49]Either his uncle or his uncle's son may redeem him, or one of his next relations of his family may redeem him; or if his means be sufficient, he may redeem himself.

\[51]If there are yet many years, according unto them shall he return his redemption [money] out of the money that he was bought for;

\[53]As a hired servant shall he be with him year by year; [his master] shall not rule with rigour over him before thine eyes.
\[54]And if he be not redeemed in this manner, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he and his children with him.

\[25]And I will bring a sword upon you that avengeth with the vengeance of the covenant, and ye shall be gathered together into your cities, and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
\[26]When I break the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and shall deliver you the bread again by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
\[27]And if for this ye hearken not to me, but walk contrary unto me,
\[28]then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven-fold for your sins.
\[29]And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
\[30]And I will lay waste your high places, and cut down your sun-pillars, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you.
\[31]And I will lay waste your cities and desolate your sanctuaries; and I will not smell your sweet odours.
\[32]And I will bring the land into desolation; that your enemies who dwell there in may be astonished at it.
\[33]And I will scatter you among the nations, and will draw out the sword after you; and your land shall be desolation, and your cities waste.
\[34]Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths all the days of the desolation, when ye are in your enemies' land; then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.
\[35]All the days of the desolation it shall rest, [the days in] which it did not rest on your sabbaths, when ye dwelt therein.
\[36]And as to those that remain of you—I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies, that the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth;
\[37]and they shall stumble one over another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth; and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
\[38]And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
\[39]And they that remain of you shall waste away through their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also through the iniquities of their fathers shall they waste away with them.
\[40]And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, through their unfaithfulness wherein they were unfaithful to me, and also that they have walked contrary unto me,
\[41]so that I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies. If then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity,
\[42]I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
\[43]For the land shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, when it is in desolation without them; and they shall accept the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they despised my judgments, and their soul abhorred my statutes.
\[44]And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not despise them, and will not abhor them, to make an end of them utterly, to break my covenant with them, for I am Jehovah their God.
\[45]But I will remember toward them the covenant with their ancestors whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah.
\[46]These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.

nd Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[2]Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them, When any one devoteth [anything] by a vow, the persons shall be for Jehovah according to thy valuation.
\[3]And thy valuation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old: thy valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary;
\[4]and if it be of a female, thy valuation shall be thirty shekels.
\[5]And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, thy valuation of the male shall be twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
\[6]And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, thy valuation of the male shall be five shekels of silver; and for the female thy valuation shall be three shekels of silver.
\[7]And if it be from sixty years old and above, if it be a male, thy valuation shall be fifteen shekels; and for the female ten shekels.
\[8]And if he be poorer than thy valuation, he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him: according to his means that vowed shall the priest value him.
\[9]And if it be a beast whereof men bring an offering unto Jehovah, all that they give of such unto Jehovah shall be holy.
\[10]They shall not alter it nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.
\[11]And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not bring an offering unto Jehovah, then he shall present the beast before the priest;
\[12]and the priest shall value it, [judging] between good and bad: according to the valuation of the priest, so shall it be.
\[13]And if they will in any wise redeem it, then they shall add a fifth [part] thereof unto thy valuation.
\[14]And when any one halloweth his house, that it may be holy to Jehovah, the priest shall value it, [judging] between good and bad: as the priest shall value it, so shall it stand.
\[15]And if he that halloweth it will redeem his house, he shall add the fifth of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be his.
\[16]And if a man hallow to Jehovah [part] of a field of his possession, thy valuation shall be according to what may be sown in it: the homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver.
\[17]If he hallow his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy valuation shall it stand;
\[18]but if he hallow his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, until the year of the jubilee; and there shall be a reduction from thy valuation.
\[19]And if he that hallowed the field will in any wise redeem it, he shall add the fifth of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be assured to him;
\[20]but if he do not redeem the field, or if he sell the field to another man, it cannot be redeemed any more;
\[21]and the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy to Jehovah, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.
\[22]And if he hallow to Jehovah a field that he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession,
\[23]the priest shall reckon unto him the amount of thy valuation, unto the year of the jubilee; and he shall give thy valuation on that day, [as] holy to Jehovah.
\[24]In the year of the jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought—to him to whom the land belonged.
\[25]And all thy valuation shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
\[26]Only the firstling which is offered as firstling to Jehovah among the cattle, that shall no man hallow, whether it be ox or sheep; it is Jehovah's.
\[27]But if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thy valuation, and shall add a fifth of it thereto; and if it be not redeemed, it shall be sold according to thy valuation.
\[28]Notwithstanding, no devoted thing that a man hath devoted to Jehovah of all that he hath, of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to Jehovah.
\[29]Nothing devoted, which shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed: it shall certainly be put to death.
\[30]And as to every tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, and of the fruit of the tree, it is Jehovah's: it is holy to Jehovah.
\[31]And if any one will at all redeem of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth thereof.
\[32]And as to every tithe of the herd, or of the flock, of whatever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to Jehovah.
\[33]He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it; and if he change it at all, then both it and the exchange thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
\[34]These are the commandments which Jehovah commanded Moses for the children of Israel upon mount Sinai.

\[2]Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by a dead person:
\[3]both male and female shall ye put out; outside the camp shall ye put them, that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.
\[4]And the children of Israel did so, and put them outside the camp: as Jehovah had said to Moses, so did the children of Israel.
\[5]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[6]Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any of all the sins of man to work unfaithfulness against Jehovah, and that soul is guilty,
\[7]then they shall confess their sin which they have done; and he shall recompense his trespass according to the principal thereof, and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed.
\[8]And if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, the trespass which is recompensed to Jehovah shall be the priest's, besides the ram of the atonement, wherewith an atonement is made for him.
\[9]And every heave-offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they present unto the priest, shall be his.
\[10]And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatever any man giveth the priest shall be his.
\[11]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[12]Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife go astray, and commit unfaithfulness against him,
\[13]and a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and she be defiled in secret, and there be no witness against her, and she have not been caught;
\[14]and the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she have been defiled,—or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she have not been defiled,
\[15]—then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, a tenth part of an ephah of barley-meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an oblation of jealousy, a memorial oblation, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
\[16]And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before Jehovah.
\[17]And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and the priest shall take of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle, and put it into the water.
\[18]And the priest shall set the woman before Jehovah, and uncover the woman's head, and put the memorial oblation in her hands, which is the jealousy offering; and in the hand of the priest shall be the bitter water that bringeth the curse.
\[19]And the priest shall adjure her, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone astray in uncleanness, in being with another instead of thy husband, be free from this bitter water that bringeth the curse.
\[20]But if thou hast gone astray to another instead of thy husband, and hast been defiled, and a man other than thy husband have lain with thee,
\[21]—then the priest shall adjure the woman with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman: Jehovah make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when Jehovah doth make thy thigh to shrink, and thy belly to swell;
\[22]and this water that bringeth the curse shall enter into thy bowels, to make the belly to swell, and the thigh to shrink. And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.
\[23]And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and shall blot them out with the bitter water,
\[24]and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that bringeth the curse, that the water that bringeth the curse may enter into her for bitterness.
\[25]And the priest shall take out of the woman's hand the oblation of jealousy, and shall wave the oblation before Jehovah, and shall present it at the altar.
\[26]And the priest shall take a handful of the oblation as a memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar; and afterwards he shall make the woman drink the water.
\[27]And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, if she have been defiled, and have committed unfaithfulness against her husband, that the water that bringeth the curse shall enter into her, for bitterness, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall shrink; and the woman shall become a curse among her people.
\[28]But if the woman have not been defiled, and be clean, then she shall be clear, and shall conceive seed.
\[29]This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth astray to another instead of her husband and is defiled,
\[30]or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon a man, and he is jealous as regards his wife; then shall he set the woman before Jehovah, and the priest shall do to her according to all this law.

\[2]Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If a man or a woman have vowed the special vow of a Nazarite, to consecrate themselves to Jehovah;
\[3]he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink: he shall drink no vinegar of wine, nor vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat grapes, fresh or dried.
\[4]All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine, from the seed-stones, even to the skin.
\[5]All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head; until the days be fulfilled, that he hath consecrated himself to Jehovah, he shall be holy; he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.
\[6]All the days that he hath consecrated himself to Jehovah, he shall come near no dead body.
\[7]He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister when they die; for the consecration of his God is upon his head.
\[8]All the days of his separation he is holy to Jehovah.
\[9]And if any one die unexpectedly by him suddenly, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration, then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day shall he shave it.
\[10]And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
\[11]And the priest shall offer one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead person; and he shall hallow his head that same day.
\[12]And he shall [again] consecrate to Jehovah the days of his separation, and shall bring a yearling lamb for a trespass-offering. But the first days are forfeited, for his consecration hath been defiled.
\[13]And this is the law of the Nazarite on the day when the days of his consecration are fulfilled: he shall be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting.
\[14]And he shall present his offering to Jehovah, one yearling he-lamb without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one yearling ewe-lamb without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for a peace-offering;
\[15]and a basket with unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their oblation, and their drink-offerings.
\[16]And the priest shall present them before Jehovah, and shall offer his sin-offering and his burnt-offering:
\[17]and he shall offer the ram, a sacrifice of peace-offering to Jehovah, with the basket of unleavened bread; the priest shall offer also his oblation and his drink-offering.
\[18]And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his consecration at the entrance to the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his consecration, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace-offering.
\[19]And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after he hath shaven [the hair of] his consecration.
\[20]And the priest shall wave them as wave-offering before Jehovah; it is holy for the priest, with the breast of the wave-offering and with the shoulder of the heave-offering; and afterwards the Nazarite may drink wine.
\[21]This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed: his offering to Jehovah for his consecration, beside what his hand is able to get; according to the vow which he vowed, so shall he do, according to the law of his consecration.
\[22]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[23]Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel: saying unto them,
\[24]Jehovah bless thee, and keep thee;
\[25]Jehovah make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee;

\[25]And from fifty years old he shall retire from the labour of the service, and shall serve no more;

\[2]Make thee two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them; and they shall serve for the calling together of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.
\[3]And when they shall blow with them, the whole assembly shall gather to thee at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
\[4]And if they blow with one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather unto thee.
\[5]And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie eastward shall set forward.
\[6]And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie southward shall set forward; they shall blow an alarm on their setting forward.
\[7]And when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not blow an alarm:
\[8]the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an everlasting statute throughout your generations.
\[9]And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before Jehovah your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
\[10]And in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in your new moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings and over your sacrifices of peace-offering; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am Jehovah your God.
\[11]And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth of the month, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.
\[12]And the children of Israel set forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud stood still in the wilderness of Paran.
\[13]And they first took their journey, according to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses.
\[14]The standard of the camp of the children of Judah set forward first according to their hosts, and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab;
\[15]and over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar;
\[16]and over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.
\[17]And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward bearing the tabernacle.
\[18]And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their hosts, and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur;
\[19]and over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai;
\[20]and over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
\[21]And the Kohathites set forward bearing the sanctuary: and [the others] set up the tabernacle whilst they came.
\[22]And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their hosts, and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud;
\[23]and over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur;
\[24]and over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.
\[25]And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, the rear-guard of all the camps according to their hosts, and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai;
\[26]and over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran;
\[27]and over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
\[28]These were the settings forward of the children of Israel according to their hosts: so did they set forward.
\[29]And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, We are journeying to the place of which Jehovah said, I will give it unto you: come with us, and we will do thee good; for Jehovah has spoken good concerning Israel.
\[30]And he said to him, I will not go; but to mine own land, and to my kindred will I go.
\[31]And he said, Leave me not, I pray thee, because thou knowest where we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou wilt be to us for eyes.
\[32]And it shall be, if thou come with us, that whatever good Jehovah doeth unto us, so will we do to thee.
\[33]And they set forward from the mountain of Jehovah [and went] three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting-place for them.
\[34]And the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day when they set forward out of the camp.
\[35]And it came to pass when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered; And let them that hate thee flee before thy face.

nd it came to pass that when the people murmured, it was evil in the ears of Jehovah; and Jehovah heard it, and his anger was kindled, and the fire of Jehovah burned among them, and consumed [some] in the extremity of the camp.
\[2]And the people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Jehovah—and the fire abated.
\[3]And they called the name of that place Taberah; because a fire of Jehovah burned among them.
\[4]And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted; and the children of Israel also wept again and said, Who will give us flesh to eat?
\[5]We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic;
\[6]and now our soul is dried up: there is nothing at all but the manna before our eyes.
\[7]And the manna was as coriander seed, and its appearance as the appearance of bdellium.
\[8]The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it with hand-mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it; and the taste of it was as the taste of oil-cakes.
\[9]And when the dew fell upon the camp by night, the manna fell upon it.
\[10]And Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every one at the entrance of his tent; and the anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly; it was also evil in the eyes of Moses.
\[11]And Moses said to Jehovah, Why hast thou done evil to thy servant, and why have I not found favour in thine eyes, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?
\[12]Have I conceived all this people, have I brought them forth, that thou sayest to me, Carry them in thy bosom, as the nursing-father beareth the suckling, unto the land which thou didst swear unto their fathers?
\[13]Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh that we may eat!
\[14]I am not able to bear all this people alone, for it is too heavy for me.
\[15]And if thou deal thus with me, slay me, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, that I may not behold my wretchedness.
\[16]And Jehovah said to Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and their officers; and take them to the tent of meeting, and they shall stand there with thee.
\[17]And I will come down and talk with thee there; and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, and thou shalt not bear it alone.
\[18]And unto the people shalt thou say, Hallow yourselves for to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who will give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt; and Jehovah will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.
\[19]Not one day shall ye eat, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;
\[20][but] for a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it become loathsome unto you; because that ye have despised Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?
\[21]And Moses said, The people in whose midst I am are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou sayest, I will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month.
\[22]Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered for them, to suffice them?
\[23]And Jehovah said to Moses, Hath Jehovah's hand become short? Now shalt thou see whether my word will come to pass unto thee or not.
\[24]And Moses went out and told the people the words of Jehovah; and he gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tent.
\[25]And Jehovah came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy men, the elders; and it came to pass, that when the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did not repeat [it].
\[26]And two men remained in the camp, the name of the one, Eldad, and the name of the other, Medad; and the Spirit rested upon them (and they were among them that were written, but they had not gone out to the tent); and they prophesied in the camp.
\[27]And there ran a youth, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.
\[28]And Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them!
\[29]But Moses said to him, Enviest thou for my sake? would that all Jehovah's people were prophets, [and] that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them!
\[30]And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
\[31]And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and drove quails from the sea, and cast them about the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and about a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the earth.
\[32]And the people rose up all that day, and the whole night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered little gathered ten homers; and they spread them abroad for themselves round about the camp.
\[33]The flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, when the wrath of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.
\[34]And they called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah; because there they buried the people who lusted.
\[35]From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth; and they were at Hazeroth.

\[3]But the man Moses was very meek, above all men that were upon the face of the earth.
\[4]Then Jehovah spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting. And they went out, they three.
\[5]And Jehovah came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood at the entrance of the tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth.
\[6]And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I Jehovah will make myself known to him in a vision, I will speak to him in a dream.
\[7]Not so my servant Moses: he is faithful in all my house.
\[8]Mouth to mouth do I speak to him openly, and not in riddles; and the form of Jehovah doth he behold. Why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?

\[10]and the cloud departed from off the tent. And behold, Miriam was leprous as snow; and Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.

\[12]Let her not be as one stillborn, half of whose flesh is consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.
\[13]And Moses cried to Jehovah, saying, O God, heal her, I beseech thee!
\[14]And Jehovah said to Moses, But had her father anyways spat in her face, should she not be shamed seven days? She shall be shut outside the camp seven days, and afterwards she shall be received in [again].

\[3]And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran: according to the commandment of Jehovah, all of them heads of the children of Israel.
\[4]And these are their names: for the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;
\[5]for the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;
\[6]for the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
\[7]for the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;

\[13]for the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;
\[14]for the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;
\[15]for the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
\[16]These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to search out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Jehoshua.
\[17]And Moses sent them to search out the land of Canaan, and said to them, Go up this way by the south and go up into the hill-country,
\[18]and ye shall see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell in it, whether they are strong or weak, few or many;
\[19]and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;
\[20]and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there are trees in it, or not. And take courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first grapes.
\[21]And they went up, and searched out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, where one comes towards Hamath.
\[22]And they went up by the south, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. Now Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.
\[23]And they came as far as the valley of Eshcol, and cut down thence a branch with one bunch of grapes, and they bore it between two upon a pole; and [they brought] of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
\[24]That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the grapes which the children of Israel had cut down there.
\[25]And they returned from searching out the land after forty days.
\[26]And they came, and went to Moses and to Aaron, and to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to the whole assembly; and shewed them the fruit of the land.
\[27]And they told him, and said, We came to the land to which thou didst send us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.
\[28]Only, the people are strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, very great; moreover we saw the children of Anak there.
\[29]Amalek dwells in the land of the south; and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill-country; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the side of the Jordan.
\[30]And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up boldly and possess it, for we are well able to do it.
\[31]But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.
\[32]And they brought to the children of Israel an evil report of the land which they had searched out, saying, The land, which we have passed through to search it out, is a land that eateth up its inhabitants; and all the people that we have seen in it are men of great stature;
\[33]and there have we seen giants—the sons of Anak are of the giants—and we were in our sight as grasshoppers, and so we were also in their sight.

\[3]And why is Jehovah bringing us to this land that we may fall by the sword, that our wives and our little ones may become a prey? Is it not better for us to return to Egypt?
\[4]And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return to Egypt.
\[5]Then Moses and Aaron fell upon their faces before the whole congregation of the assembly of the children of Israel.
\[6]And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of them that searched out the land, rent their garments.
\[7]And they spoke to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it out, is a very, very good land.
\[8]If Jehovah delight in us, he will bring us into this land, and give it us, a land that flows with milk and honey;
\[9]only rebel not against Jehovah; and fear not the people of the land; for they shall be our food. Their defence is departed from them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not.
\[10]And the whole assembly said that they should be stoned with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of meeting to all the children of Israel.
\[11]And Jehovah said to Moses, How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe me, for all the signs which I have done among them?
\[12]I will smite them with the pestilence, and destroy them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they.
\[13]And Moses said to Jehovah, Then the Egyptians will hear it; for in thy might thou broughtest up this people from the midst of them;
\[14]and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land, [who] have heard that thou, Jehovah, art in the midst of this people, that thou, Jehovah, lettest thyself be seen eye to eye, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night;
\[15]if thou now slayest this people as one man, then the nations that have heard thy fame will speak, saying,
\[16]Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land that he had sworn unto them, he has therefore slain them in the wilderness.
\[17]And now, I beseech thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,
\[18]Jehovah is slow to anger, and abundant in goodness, forgiving iniquity and transgression, but by no means clearing [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and fourth [generation].
\[19]Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy loving-kindness, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.
\[20]And Jehovah said, I have pardoned according to thy word.
\[21]But as surely as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah!
\[22]for all those men who have seen my glory, and my signs, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice,
\[23]shall in no wise see the land which I did swear unto their fathers: none of them that despised me shall see it.
\[24]But my servant Caleb, because he hath another spirit in him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he came; and his seed shall possess it.
\[25](Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valley.) To-morrow turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness, on the way to the Red sea.

\[27]How long [shall I bear] with this evil assembly, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.
\[28]Say unto them, As surely as I live, saith Jehovah, if I do not do unto you as ye have spoken in mine ears!
\[29]In this wilderness shall your carcases fall; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number from twenty years old and upwards, who have murmured against me,
\[30]shall in no wise come into the land, concerning which I have lifted up my hand to make you dwell in it; save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
\[31]But your little ones, of whom ye said they should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land that ye have despised.
\[32]And as to you, your carcases shall fall in this wilderness.
\[33]And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.
\[34]After the number of the days in which ye have searched out the land, forty days, each day for a year shall ye bear your iniquities forty years, and ye shall know mine estrangement [from you].
\[35]I Jehovah have spoken; I will surely do it unto all this evil assembly which have gathered together against me! in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.
\[36]And the men whom Moses had sent to search out the land, who returned, and made the whole assembly to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report upon the land,
\[37]even those men who had brought up an evil report upon the land, died by a plague before Jehovah.
\[38]But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, lived still of the men that had gone to search out the land.
\[39]And Moses told all these sayings to all the children of Israel; then the people mourned greatly.
\[40]And they rose up early in the morning, and went up to the hill-top, saying, Here are we, and we will go up to the place of which Jehovah has spoken; for we have sinned.
\[41]And Moses said, Why now do ye transgress the commandment of Jehovah? but it shall not prosper!
\[42]Go not up, for Jehovah is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies;
\[43]for the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword; for as ye have turned away from Jehovah, Jehovah will not be with you.
\[44]Yet they presumed to go up to the hill-top; but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and Moses, did not depart from the midst of the camp.

\[3]and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, It is enough; for all the assembly, all of them are holy, and Jehovah is among them; and why do ye lift up yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah?
\[4]When Moses heard this, he fell on his face.
\[5]And he spoke to Korah and to all his band, saying, Even to-morrow will Jehovah make known who is his, and who is holy; and he will cause him to come near to him; and him whom he has chosen, him will he cause to come near to him.
\[6]This do: take you censers, Korah, and all his band,
\[7]and put fire therein, and lay incense thereon before Jehovah to-morrow; and it shall be that the man whom Jehovah doth choose, he shall be holy. It is enough, ye sons of Levi!
\[8]And Moses said to Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi!
\[9]Is it too little for you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the assembly of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the work of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the assembly to minister to them?
\[10]—that he has brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee; and seek ye now the priesthood also?
\[11]For which cause thou and all thy band are banded together against Jehovah; and Aaron, who is he that ye murmur against him?
\[12]And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; but they said, We will not come up!
\[13]Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that thou must make thyself altogether a ruler over us?
\[14]Moreover, thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up!
\[15]Then Moses was very wroth, and said to Jehovah, Have no regard to their oblation: not one ass have I taken from them, neither have I hurt one of them.
\[16]And Moses said to Korah, Be thou and all thy band before Jehovah, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow.
\[17]And take each his censer, and put incense thereon, and present before Jehovah every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; and thou, and Aaron, each his censer.
\[18]And they took each his censer, and put fire on them, and laid incense thereon, and stood before the entrance to the tent of meeting, as well as Moses and Aaron.
\[19]And Korah gathered the whole assembly against them to the entrance of the tent of meeting. And the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the assembly.
\[20]And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
\[21]Separate yourselves from the midst of this assembly, and I will consume them in a moment.
\[22]And they fell on their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh! shall *one* man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with the whole assembly?
\[23]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[24]Speak unto the assembly, saying, Get you up from about the habitation of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
\[25]And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
\[26]And he spoke to the assembly, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye perish in all their sins.
\[27]And they got up from the habitation of Koran, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. And Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the entrance of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.
\[28]And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these deeds, for they are not out of my own heart:
\[29]if these men die as all men die, and are visited with the visitation of all men, Jehovah has not sent me;
\[30]but if Jehovah make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth, and swallow them up, and all that they have, and they go down alive into Sheol, then ye shall know that these men have despised Jehovah.
\[31]And it came to pass when he had ended speaking all these words, that the ground clave apart that was under them.
\[32]And the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that belonged to Korah, and all their property.
\[33]And they went down, they and all that they had, alive into Sheol, and the earth covered them; and they perished from among the congregation.
\[34]And all Israel that were round about them fled at their cry; for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up!
\[35]And there came out a fire from Jehovah, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that had presented incense.
\[36]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[37]Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning; and scatter the fire afar; for they are hallowed,
\[38]the censers of these sinners who have forfeited their life; and they shall make them into broad plates for the covering of the altar; for they presented them before Jehovah, therefore they are hallowed; and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.
\[39]And Eleazar the priest took the copper censers, which they that were burnt had presented; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:
\[40]as a memorial to the children of Israel, that no stranger who is not of the seed of Aaron come near to burn incense before Jehovah, that he be not as Korah, and as his band,—as Jehovah had said to him through Moses.
\[41]And the whole assembly of the children of Israel murmured on the morrow against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of Jehovah.
\[42]And it came to pass, when the assembly was gathered together against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting, and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared.
\[43]And Moses and Aaron went before the tent of meeting.
\[44]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[45]Get you up from the midst of this assembly, and I will consume them in a moment. And they fell on their faces.
\[46]And Moses said to Aaron, Take the censer, and put fire thereon from off the altar, and lay on incense, and carry it quickly to the assembly, and make atonement for them; for there is wrath gone out from Jehovah: the plague is begun.
\[47]And Aaron took as Moses had said, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and behold, the plague had begun among the people; and he put on incense, and made atonement for the people.
\[48]And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
\[49]Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides them that had died because of the matter of Korah.
\[50]And Aaron returned to Moses to the entrance of the tent of meeting; and the plague was stayed.

\[3]And Aaron's name shalt thou write upon the staff of Levi; for one staff shall be for [each] head of their fathers' houses.
\[4]And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.
\[5]And it shall come to pass, that the man whom I shall choose, his staff shall bud forth; and I will make to cease from before me the murmurings of the children of Israel, that they murmur against you.
\[6]And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and all their princes gave him a staff, one staff for each prince according to their fathers' houses, twelve staves, and the staff of Aaron was among their staves.
\[7]And Moses laid the staves before Jehovah in the tent of the testimony.
\[8]And it came to pass, when on the morrow Moses went into the tent of the testimony, behold, the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and ripened almonds.
\[9]And Moses brought out all the staves from before Jehovah to all the children of Israel, and they looked and took each one his staff.
\[10]And Jehovah said to Moses, Bring Aaron's staff again before the testimony, to be kept as a token for the sons of rebellion, that thou mayest put an end to their murmurings before me, that they may not die.
\[11]And Moses did so: as Jehovah had commanded him, so did he.
\[12]And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Lo, we expire, we perish, we all perish.
\[13]Every one that comes at all near to the tabernacle of Jehovah shall die: shall we then expire altogether?

\[2]And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring near with thee, that they may unite with thee, and minister unto thee; but thou and thy sons with thee [shall serve] before the tent of the testimony.
\[3]And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of the whole tent: only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar, that they may not die, and you as well as they.
\[4]And they shall unite with thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; and no stranger shall come near to you.
\[5]And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there come no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.
\[6]And I, behold, I have taken your brethren, the Levites, from among the children of Israel; to you are they given as a gift for Jehovah to perform the service of the tent of meeting.
\[7]But thou and thy sons with thee shall attend to your priesthood for all that concerneth the altar, and for that which is inside the veil; and ye shall perform the service: I give you your priesthood as a service of gift, and the stranger that cometh near shall be put to death.
\[8]And Jehovah spoke to Aaron, And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings, of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to thee have I given them, because of the anointing, and to thy sons by an everlasting statute.
\[9]This shall be thine of the most holy things, [reserved] from the fire: every offering of theirs, of all their oblations, and of all their sin-offerings, and of all their trespass-offerings, which they render unto me, it is most holy for thee and for thy sons.
\[10]As most holy shalt thou eat it: every male shall eat it; it shall be holy unto thee.
\[11]And this shall be thine: the heave-offering of their gift, with all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by an everlasting statute; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.
\[12]All the best of the oil, and all the best of the new wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they give to Jehovah, have I given thee.
\[13]The first ripe of everything that is in their land, which they shall bring to Jehovah, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.
\[14]Every devoted thing in Israel shall be thine.
\[15]Everything that breaketh open the womb of all flesh, which they present to Jehovah, of men or of beasts, shall be thine; nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou in any case ransom, and the firstborn of unclean beasts shalt thou ransom.
\[16]And those that are to be ransomed from a month old shalt thou ransom, according to thy valuation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.
\[17]But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat, thou shalt not ransom: they are holy. Thou shalt sprinkle their blood on the altar, and their fat shalt thou burn as an offering by fire for a sweet odour to Jehovah.
\[18]And their flesh shall be thine; as the wave-breast and as the right shoulder shall it be thine.
\[19]All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to Jehovah, have I given thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by an everlasting statute: it shall be an everlasting covenant of salt before Jehovah unto thee and thy seed with thee.
\[20]And Jehovah said to Aaron, In their land thou shalt have no inheritance, neither shalt thou have any portion among them: I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.
\[21]And to the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithes in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they perform, the service of the tent of meeting.
\[22]Neither shall the children of Israel henceforth come near the tent of meeting, to bear sin and die.
\[23]But the Levite, he shall perform the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it is an everlasting statute throughout your generations. And among the children of Israel shall they possess no inheritance;
\[24]for I have given for an inheritance to the Levites the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering to Jehovah; therefore I have said of them, They shall possess no inheritance among the children of Israel.
\[25]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[26]And to the Levites shalt thou speak, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer a heave-offering from it for Jehovah, the tenth of the tithe.
\[27]And your heave-offering shall be reckoned unto you, as the corn from the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the winepress.
\[28]Thus ye also shall offer Jehovah's heave-offering of all your tithes, which ye take of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof Jehovah's heave-offering to Aaron the priest.
\[29]Out of all that is given you ye shall offer the whole heave-offering of Jehovah,—of all the best thereof the hallowed part thereof.
\[30]And thou shalt say unto them, When ye heave the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as produce of the threshing-floor, and as produce of the winepress.
\[31]And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households; for it is your reward for your service in the tent of meeting.

\[3]And the people contended with Moses, and spoke, saying, Would that we had died when our brethren died before Jehovah!
\[4]And why have ye brought the congregation of Jehovah into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our beasts?
\[5]And why have ye made us to go up out of Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates, neither is there any water to drink.

\[13]These are the waters of Meribah, where the children of Israel contended with Jehovah, and he hallowed himself in them.

\[15]how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians evil entreated us and our fathers;
\[16]and when we cried to Jehovah, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt; and behold, we are at Kadesh, a city at the extremity of thy border.
\[17]Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country; we will not pass through fields, or through vineyards, neither will we drink water out of the wells: we will go by the king's road; we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border.
\[18]But Edom said to him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.
\[19]And the children of Israel said to him, We will go by the high way; and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then I will pay for it: I will only, without anything else, go through on my feet.
\[20]And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.

\[3]And Jehovah listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them, and their cities. And they called the name of the place Hormah.
\[4]And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to go round the land of Edom; and the soul of the people became impatient on the way;
\[5]and the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have ye brought us up out of Egypt that we should die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, and no water, and our soul loathes this light bread.
\[6]Then Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, which bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
\[7]And the people came to Moses and said, We have sinned, in that we have spoken against Jehovah, and against thee: pray to Jehovah that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
\[8]And Jehovah said to Moses, Make thee a fiery [serpent], and set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, and looketh upon it, shall live.

\[11]And they removed from Oboth, and encamped at Ijim-Abarim, in the wilderness that is before Moab, toward the sun-rising.
\[12]From thence they removed, and encamped at the torrent Zered.
\[13]From thence they removed, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites. For the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.

\[22]Let us pass through thy land; we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink water out of the wells; on the king's road will we go until we have passed thy border.
\[23]But Sihon would not suffer Israel to go through his border; and Sihon gathered all his people, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
\[24]And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
\[25]And Israel took all these cities, and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, at Heshbon, and in all its dependent villages.
\[26]For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites; and he had fought against the former king of Moab, and had taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the Arnon.
\[27]Therefore the poets say, Come to Heshbon; let the city of Sihon be built and established.
\[28]For there went forth fire from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; It consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of the high places of the Arnon.
\[29]Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, people of Chemosh: He gave his sons that had escaped, and his daughters into captivity to Sihon the king of the Amorites.
\[30]And we have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon; and we have laid [them] waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.
\[31]And Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
\[32]And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took its dependent villages, and he dispossessed the Amorites that were there.
\[33]And they turned and went up by the way to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, for battle to Edrei.
\[34]And Jehovah said to Moses, Fear him not! for into thy hand have I given him, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.

\[14]And the princes of Moab rose up; and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam has refused to come with us.
\[15]Then sent Balak yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.

\[17]for very highly will I honour thee, and whatever thou shalt say to me will I do; come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.

\[19]And now, I pray you, abide ye also here this night, and I shall know what Jehovah will say to me further.
\[20]Then God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men have come to call thee, rise up, [and] go with them; but only what I shall say unto thee shalt thou do.
\[21]And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
\[22]And God's anger was kindled because he went; and the Angel of Jehovah set himself in the way to withstand him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two young men were with him.
\[23]And the ass saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field, and Balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way.
\[24]And the Angel of Jehovah stood in a hollow of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.
\[25]And the ass saw the Angel of Jehovah, and she pressed herself against the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall; and he smote her again.
\[26]Then the Angel of Jehovah went still further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
\[27]And the ass saw the Angel of Jehovah, and lay down under Balaam; and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff.
\[28]And Jehovah opened the mouth of the ass, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?
\[29]And Balaam said to the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in my hand, for now would I kill thee!
\[30]And the ass said to Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine to this day? was I ever wont to do so to thee? And he said, No.
\[31]Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed and prostrated himself on his face.
\[32]And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, it was I who came forth to withstand thee, for the way [thou walkest in] is for ruin before me.
\[33]And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times; had she not turned from me, I had now certainly slain thee, and saved her alive.
\[34]And Balaam said to the Angel of Jehovah, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me; and now, if it be evil in thine eyes, I will get me back again.
\[35]And the Angel of Jehovah said to Balaam, Go with the men, but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that shalt thou speak. And Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
\[36]And when Balak heard that Balaam came, he went out to meet him, to the city of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is at the extremity of the border.
\[37]And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to thee to call thee? why didst thou not come to me? am I not surely able to honour thee?
\[38]And Balaam said to Balak, Lo, I am come to thee; but shall I now be able at all to say anything? the word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.
\[39]And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjath-huzoth.
\[40]And Balak offered oxen and small cattle, and sent to Balaam and to the princes that were with him.
\[41]And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up to the high places of Baal, and he saw from thence the extremity of the people.

\[2]And Balak did as Balaam had said; and Balak and Balaam offered up a bullock and a ram on [each] altar.
\[3]And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go; perhaps Jehovah will come to meet me; and whatever he shews me I will tell thee. And he went to a hill.
\[4]And God met Balaam; and [Balaam] said to him, I have disposed seven altars, and have offered up a bullock and a ram upon [each] altar.
\[5]And Jehovah put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.
\[6]And he returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.
\[7]And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, from the mountains of the east: Come, curse me Jacob, and come, denounce Israel!
\[8]How shall I curse whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I denounce whom Jehovah doth not denounce?
\[9]For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: Lo, [it is] a people that shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
\[10]Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let my soul die the death of the righteous, and let my end be like his!
\[11]And Balak said to Balaam, What hast thou done to me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.
\[12]And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which Jehovah puts in my mouth?
\[13]And Balak said to him, Come, I pray thee, with me to another place, from whence thou wilt see them; thou shalt see only the extremity of them and shalt not see them all, and curse me them from thence.
\[14]And he took him to the watchmen's field, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on [each] altar.
\[15]And [Balaam] said to Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, and I will go to meet yonder.
\[16]And Jehovah met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.
\[17]And he came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him; and Balak said to him, What has Jehovah spoken?
\[18]Then he took up his parable and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear! hearken unto me, son of Zippor!
\[19]God is not a man, that he should lie; neither a son of man, that he should repent. Shall he say and not do? and shall he speak and not make it good?
\[20]Behold, I have received [mission] to bless; and he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.
\[21]He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen wrong in Israel; Jehovah his God is with him, and the shout of a king is in his midst.
\[22]God brought him out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of a buffalo.
\[23]For there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel. At this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!
\[24]Lo, the people will rise up as a lioness, and lift himself up as a lion. He shall not lie down until he have eaten the prey and drunk the blood of the slain.
\[25]And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
\[26]And Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not tell thee, saying, All that Jehovah shall speak, that will I do?
\[27]And Balak said to Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee to another place; perhaps it will be right in the sight of God that thou curse me them from thence.
\[28]And Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor, which looks over the surface of the waste.
\[29]And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
\[30]And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on each altar.

nd Balaam saw that it was good in the sight of Jehovah to bless Israel, and he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
\[2]And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel dwelling [in tents] according to his tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
\[3]And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, and the man of opened eye saith,
\[4]He saith, who heareth the words of God, who seeth the vision of the Almighty, who falleth down, and who hath his eyes open:
\[5]How goodly are thy tents, Jacob, and thy tabernacles, Israel!
\[6]Like valleys are they spread forth, like gardens by the river side, Like aloe-trees which Jehovah hath planted, like cedars beside the waters.
\[7]Water shall flow out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in great waters, And his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
\[8]God brought him out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of a buffalo. He shall consume the nations his enemies, and break their bones, and with his arrows shall smite [them] in pieces.
\[9]He stooped, he lay down like a lion, and like a lioness: who will stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.
\[10]Then Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and behold, thou hast altogether blessed [them] these three times!
\[11]And now flee thou to thy place; I said I would very highly honour thee, and behold, Jehovah has kept thee back from honour.
\[12]And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not also speak to thy messengers whom thou sentest to me, saying,
\[13]If Balak gave me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the commandment of Jehovah to do good or bad out of my heart: what Jehovah shall say, that will I speak?
\[14]And now behold, I go to my people: come, I will admonish thee what this people will do to thy people at the end of days.
\[15]And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, and the man of opened eye saith,
\[16]He saith, who heareth the words of God, who knoweth the knowledge of the Most High, Who seeth the vision of the Almighty, who falleth down, and who hath his eyes open:
\[17]I shall see him, but not now; I shall behold him, but not nigh: There cometh a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and he shall cut in pieces the corners of Moab, and destroy all the sons of tumult.
\[18]And Edom shall be a possession, and Seir a possession,—they, his enemies; but Israel will do valiantly.
\[19]And one out of Jacob shall have dominion, and will destroy out of the city what remaineth.
\[20]And he saw Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, Amalek is the first of the nations, but his latter end shall be for destruction.
\[21]And he saw the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Firm is thy dwelling-place, and thy nest fixed in the rock;
\[22]But the Kenite shall be consumed, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.
\[23]And he took up his parable, and said, Alas! Who shall live when God doeth this?
\[24]And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and afflict Asshur, and afflict Eber, and he also shall be for destruction.

\[3]And Israel joined himself to Baal-Peor; and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel.
\[4]And Jehovah said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up to Jehovah before the sun, that the fierce anger of Jehovah may be turned away from Israel.
\[5]And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Slay every one his men that have joined themselves to Baal-Peor.
\[6]And behold, a man of the children of Israel came and brought a Midianitish woman to his brethren, in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of the whole assembly of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the entrance of the tent of meeting.

\[11]Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.
\[12]Therefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace!

\[15]And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was tribal head of a father's house in Midian.

\[18]for they have harassed you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague because of the matter of Peor.

\[7]The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.
\[8]And unto the children of Israel shalt thou speak, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.
\[9]And if he have no daughter, ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.
\[10]And if he have no brethren, ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren.
\[11]And if his father have no brethren, ye shall give his inheritance to his kinsman that is nearest to him in his family, and he shall possess it; and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of right, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

\[13]And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy peoples, as Aaron thy brother was gathered,
\[14]because ye rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, as to hallowing me in the matter of the water before their eyes. (That is the water of Meribah at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
\[15]And Moses spoke to Jehovah, saying,
\[16]Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the assembly,
\[17]who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in, that the assembly of Jehovah be not as sheep that have no shepherd.
\[18]And Jehovah said to Moses, Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and thou shalt lay thy hand upon him;
\[19]and thou shalt set him before Eleazar the priest, and before the whole assembly; and give him commandment before their eyes.
\[20]And thou shalt put of thine honour upon him, that the whole assembly of the children of Israel may obey him.
\[21]And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him, by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, he, and all the children of Israel with him, even the whole assembly.

\[5]and a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for an oblation, mingled with beaten oil, a fourth part of a hin:

\[8]And the second lamb thou shalt offer between the two evenings; [with the] like oblation as that of the morning, and the like drink-offering, shalt thou offer it as an offering by fire of a sweet odour to Jehovah.
\[9]And on the sabbath day two yearling lambs without blemish, and two tenth parts of fine flour as an oblation, mingled with oil, and the drink-offering thereof:

\[19]and ye shall present an offering by fire, a burnt-offering to Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven yearling lambs; they shall be unto you without blemish;
\[20]and their oblation shall be of fine flour mingled with oil: three tenth parts shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth parts for the ram;
\[21]one tenth part shalt thou offer for each lamb, of the seven lambs;
\[22]and a he-goat as a sin-offering, to make atonement for you.
\[23]Besides the burnt-offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt-offering, shall ye offer this.

\[3]If a woman also vow a vow to Jehovah, and bind herself by a bond, in her father's house in her youth,
\[4]and her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall be silent at her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.
\[5]But if her father prohibited her in the day that he heard, none of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand; and Jehovah shall pardon her, because her father prohibited her.
\[6]And if she have a husband, when she hath her vow upon her or ought that hath passed her lips wherewith she hath bound her soul,
\[7]and her husband hear it and be silent at her in the day that he heareth it, then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
\[8]But if her husband prohibit her on the day that he heareth it, and annul her vow which is upon her, and what hath passed her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul, then Jehovah shall pardon her.
\[9]But the vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced,—everything wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand against her.
\[10]And if she have vowed in her husband's house, or have bound her soul by an oath with a bond,
\[11]and her husband have heard it, and been silent at her, and hath not prohibited her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.
\[12]But if her husband have expressly annulled them on the day that he heard them, then nothing of that which is gone out of her lips as to her vows or the bond on her soul, shall stand: her husband hath annulled them; and Jehovah will pardon her.
\[13]Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband can establish it, or her husband can annul it.
\[14]And if her husband be altogether silent at her from day to day, then he hath established all her vows or all her bonds which are upon her; he hath confirmed them, for he hath been silent at her in the day that he heard them.
\[15]But if he in any way annul them after he hath heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.

\[3]And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm from amongst you men for military service, that they go against Midian to execute Jehovah's vengeance upon Midian.
\[4]Of every tribe a thousand, of all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.
\[5]And there were levied out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand by tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
\[6]And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand by the tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, and the holy instruments, even the alarm-trumpets in his hand.
\[7]And they warred against Midian, as Jehovah had commanded Moses, and slew all the males.
\[8]And they slew the kings of Midian, besides the others slain, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian; and Balaam the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
\[9]And the children of Israel took the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took for a spoil all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods;
\[10]and all their cities in their settlements and all their encampments they burned with fire.
\[11]And they took all the booty, and all the prey, of man and of cattle;
\[12]and they brought to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to the assembly of the children of Israel, the captives and the prey and the booty, to the camp in the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan of Jericho.
\[13]And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the assembly went forth to meet them outside the camp.
\[14]And Moses was wroth with the officers of the army, with the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war;
\[15]and Moses said to them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
\[16]Lo, these, through the counsel of Balaam, caused the children of Israel to commit sin against Jehovah in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague on the assembly of Jehovah.
\[17]And now slay every male among the little ones, and slay every woman that hath known man by lying with him,
\[18]but all the children among the women that have not known lying with a man, keep alive for yourselves.
\[19]And encamp outside the camp seven days; whoever hath killed a person, and whoever hath touched any slain; ye shall purify yourselves on the third day, and on the seventh day, you and your captives.
\[20]And every garment, and every vessel of skin, and all work of goat's hair, and every utensil of wood shall ye purify.
\[21]And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war that had gone to the battle, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded Moses.
\[22]Only the gold, and the silver, the copper, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
\[23]everything that passeth through the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean; only it shall be purified with the water of separation; and everything that cannot pass through the fire ye shall make go through the water.
\[24]And ye shall wash your garments on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean; and afterwards ye may come into the camp.

\[27]and divide the prey into halves, between them that conducted the war, who went out to the battle, and the whole assembly.
\[28]And thou shalt levy a tribute for Jehovah of the men of war who went out to the army, one soul of five hundred of the persons, and of the oxen, and of the asses, and of the small cattle.
\[29]Of their half shall ye take it, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for a heave-offering of Jehovah.
\[30]And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the asses, and of the small cattle, of every [kind of] beasts, and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, who keep the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.

\[33]and seventy-two thousand oxen,
\[34]and sixty-one thousand asses,

\[49]and they said to Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war who were under our hand, and there is not one man of us lacking.
\[50]So we present the offering of Jehovah, that which each one hath found, jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for our souls before Jehovah.
\[51]And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, all manner of wrought jewels.
\[52]And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered to Jehovah was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels, from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds.

nd the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had much cattle, a very great multitude; and they saw the land of Jaazer, and the land of Gilead, and behold, the place was a place for cattle.
\[2]And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the assembly, saying,
\[3]Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jaazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elaleh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
\[4]the country that Jehovah smote before the assembly of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle;
\[5]and they said, If we have found favour in thine eyes, let this land be given to thy servants for a possession: bring us not over the Jordan.
\[6]And Moses said to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall *ye* abide here?
\[7]And why do ye discourage the children of Israel from going over into the land that Jehovah has given them?
\[8]Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land:
\[9]they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, and discouraged the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land that Jehovah had given them.
\[10]And Jehovah's anger was kindled the same time, and he swore, saying,
\[11]If the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land that I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob! for they have not wholly followed me;
\[12]save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; for they have wholly followed Jehovah.
\[13]And Jehovah's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the whole generation was consumed that had done evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
\[14]And behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, a progeny of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of Jehovah toward Israel.
\[15]If ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.
\[16]And they drew near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones;
\[17]but we ourselves will go with diligence armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place; and our little ones shall dwell in the strong cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
\[18]We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited each one his inheritance.
\[19]For we will not inherit with them on yonder side the Jordan, and further, because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side the Jordan eastward.
\[20]And Moses said to them, If ye do this thing, if ye arm yourselves before Jehovah for war,
\[21]and all of you that are armed go over the Jordan before Jehovah, until he have dispossessed his enemies from before him,
\[22]and the land is subdued before Jehovah, and afterwards ye return, ye shall be guiltless toward Jehovah and toward Israel, and this land shall be your possession before Jehovah.
\[23]But if ye do not do so, behold, ye have sinned against Jehovah, and be sure your sin will find you out.
\[24]Build yourselves cities for your little ones, and folds for your flocks, and do that which has gone out of your mouth.
\[25]And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commands.
\[26]Our little ones, our wives, our cattle, and all our beasts shall be there in the cities of Gilead;
\[27]but thy servants will pass over, every one armed for war, before Jehovah to battle, as my lord says.
\[28]So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel.
\[29]And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben pass with you over the Jordan, every one armed for battle, before Jehovah, and the land be subdued before you, then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession;
\[30]but if they do not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
\[31]And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As Jehovah has said to thy servants, so will we do.
\[32]We will pass over armed before Jehovah into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance on this side the Jordan shall be ours.
\[33]And Moses gave to them, to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og the king of Bashan, the land, according to its cities and territories, the cities of the land round about.
\[34]And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
\[35]and Atroth-Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbebah,
\[36]and Beth-Nimrah, and Beth-haran, strong cities, and sheepfolds.
\[37]—And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elaleh, and Kirjathaim,
\[38]and Nebo, and Baal-meon (of which the names were changed), and Sibmah; and they gave other names to the cities that they built.
\[39]—And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and they dispossessed the Amorites that were therein.
\[40]And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.
\[41]And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took their hamlets, and called them Havoth-Jair.
\[42]And Nobah went and took Kenath, and its dependent villages, and called it Nobah, after his name.

\[54]And ye shall take for yourselves the land as an inheritance by lot according to your families: to the many ye shall increase their inheritance, and to the few thou shalt diminish their inheritance: where the lot falleth to him, there shall be each man's [inheritance]; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye take for yourselves the inheritance.
\[55]But if ye will not dispossess the inhabitants of the land from before you, those that ye let remain of them shall be thorns in your eyes, and pricks in your sides, and they shall harass you in the land wherein ye dwell.

\[5]And ye shall measure, without the city, the east side two thousand cubits, and the south side two thousand cubits, and the west side two thousand cubits, and the north side two thousand cubits, and the city shall be in the midst: they shall have this as suburbs of the cities.
\[6]And [among] the cities that ye shall give unto the Levites [shall be] the six cities of refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither,—and besides them ye shall give forty-two cities:
\[7]all the cities that ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities, they and their suburbs.
\[8]And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have much ye shall take much, and from them that have little ye shall take little; each one according to his inheritance which he will inherit shall give of his cities to the Levites.
\[9]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[10]Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
\[11]then ye shall appoint for yourselves cities: cities of refuge shall they be for you; that a manslayer may flee thither, who without intent smiteth a person mortally.
\[12]And ye shall have these cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he have stood before the assembly in judgment.
\[13]And the cities that ye shall give shall be six cities of refuge for you.
\[14]Three cities shall ye give on this side of the Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge.
\[15]For the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them shall these six cities be a refuge, that one who smiteth a person mortally without intent may flee thither.
\[16]And if he have smitten him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall certainly be put to death.
\[17]And if he have smitten him with a stone from the hand, wherewith one may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall certainly be put to death.
\[18]Or if he have smitten him with an instrument of wood, in the hand, wherewith one may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall certainly be put to death;
\[19]the avenger of blood, he shall put the murderer to death; when he meeteth him, he shall put him to death.
\[20]And if he thrust at him out of hatred, or hurl at him intentionally, so that he die,
\[21]or from enmity smite him with his hand, so that he die, he that smote him shall certainly be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meeteth him.—
\[22]But if he have thrust at him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him anything unintentionally,
\[23]or [have smitten him] with any stone wherewith one may die, without seeing him, and have cast it upon him so that he die, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:
\[24]then the assembly shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these judgments;
\[25]and the assembly shall rescue the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the assembly shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he had fled; and he shall abide in it until the death of the high-priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
\[26]But if the manslayer shall in any way come outside the limits of the city of his refuge whither he hath fled,
\[27]and the avenger of blood find him outside the limits of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kill the manslayer, there shall be no blood-guiltiness upon him;
\[28]for the manslayer should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high-priest; but after the death of the high-priest he may return into the land of his possession.
\[29]And this shall be unto you a statute of right throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
\[30]Whoever shall smite a person mortally, at the mouth of witnesses shall the murderer be put to death; but one witness shall not testify against a person to cause him to die.
\[31]And ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, who is guilty of death, but he shall certainly be put to death.
\[32]And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that hath fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
\[33]And ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are; for blood, it polluteth the land; and there can be no atonement made for the land, for the blood that hath been shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.
\[34]And ye shall not defile the land that ye inhabit, in the midst whereof I dwell; for I am Jehovah who dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.

nd the chief fathers of families of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:
\[2]and they said, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel; and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
\[3]Now if they be married to any of the sons of the [other] tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong; and it shall be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
\[4]And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall come, then shall their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong; and their inheritance shall be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
\[5]And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.
\[6]This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry whom they please; only they shall marry one of the tribe of their father,
\[7]that no inheritance of the children of Israel pass from tribe to tribe; for every one of the children of Israel shall keep to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
\[8]And every daughter that possesseth an inheritance among the tribes of the children of Israel, shall be married to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every one the inheritance of his fathers,
\[9]and the inheritance shall not pass from one tribe to another tribe; for each of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep to his inheritance.
\[10]Even as Jehovah had commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad;
\[11]and Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their uncles' sons.
\[12]To those that were of the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph were they married; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
\[13]These are the commandments and the ordinances which Jehovah commanded through Moses to the children of Israel, in the plains of Moab, by the Jordan of Jericho.

hese are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side the Jordan, in the wilderness, in the plain, opposite to Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
\[2]There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.
\[3]And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that Jehovah had given him in command to them;
\[4]after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt at Ashtaroth [and] at Edrei.
\[5]On this side the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to unfold this law, saying,
\[6]Jehovah our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have stayed long enough in this mountain.
\[7]Turn and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites, and unto all the neighbouring places in the plain, in the mountain, and in the lowland, and in the south, and by the seaside, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.
\[8]Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which Jehovah swore unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.
\[9]And I spoke unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone.
\[10]Jehovah your God hath multiplied you, and behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
\[11]Jehovah, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you as he hath said unto you!
\[12]How can I myself alone sustain your wear, and your burden, and your strife?
\[13]Provide you wise and understanding and known men, according to your tribes, that I may make them your chiefs.
\[14]And ye answered me, and said, The thing that thou hast spoken is good [for us] to do.
\[15]So I took the chiefs of your tribes, wise men and known, and made them chiefs over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers for your tribes.
\[16]And I commanded your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes] between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and him also that sojourneth with him.
\[17]Ye shall not respect persons in judgment: ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God's; and the matter that is too hard for you shall ye bring to me, that I may hear it.
\[18]And I commanded you at that time all the things that ye should do.
\[19]And we departed from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw, on the way to the mountain of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God had commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.
\[20]And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which Jehovah our God giveth us.
\[21]Behold, Jehovah thy God hath set the land before thee: go up, take possession, as Jehovah the God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.
\[22]And ye came near to me all of you, and said, We will send men before us, who shall examine the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and of the cities to which we shall come.
\[23]And the matter was good in mine eyes; and I took twelve men of you, one man for a tribe.
\[24]And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.
\[25]And they took of the fruit of the land in their hand, and brought it down unto us, and brought us answer, and said, The land is good that Jehovah our God hath given us.
\[26]But ye would not go up, and rebelled against the word of Jehovah your God;
\[27]and ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because Jehovah hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
\[28]Whither shall we go up? Our brethren have made our hearts melt, saying, [They are] a people greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.
\[29]And I said unto you, Be not afraid, neither fear them;
\[30]Jehovah your God who goeth before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;
\[31]and in the wilderness where thou hast seen that Jehovah thy God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came to this place.
\[32]But In this thing ye did not believe Jehovah your God,
\[33]who went in the way before you, to search you out a place for your encamping, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day.
\[34]And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying,
\[35]None among these men, this evil generation, shall in any wise see that good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers!
\[36]Except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed Jehovah.
\[37]Also Jehovah was angry with me on your account, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.
\[38]Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: strengthen him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
\[39]And your little ones, of whom ye said, They shall be a prey, and your children, who this day know neither good nor evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
\[40]But ye, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
\[41]—And ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against Jehovah, we will go up and fight, according to all that Jehovah our God hath commanded us. And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and ye would go presumptuously up the hill.
\[42]And Jehovah said to me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.
\[43]And I spoke unto you, but ye would not hear, and ye rebelled against the word of Jehovah, and acted presumptuously, and went up the hill.
\[44]And the Amorite that dwelt on that hill came out against you, and chased you, like as bees do, and cut you in pieces in Seir, as far as Hormah.
\[45]And ye returned and wept before Jehovah, but Jehovah would not listen to your voice, nor give ear unto you.
\[46]And ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode [there].

nd we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as Jehovah had said unto me; and we went round mount Seir many days.
\[2]And Jehovah spoke to me, saying,
\[3]Ye have gone round this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
\[4]And command the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you; and ye shall be very guarded:
\[5]attack them not; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot-breadth; for I have given mount Seir as a possession unto Esau.
\[6]Ye shall buy of them food for money, that ye may eat; and water shall ye also buy of them for money, that ye may drink;
\[7]for Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand. He hath known thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years hath Jehovah thy God been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.
\[8]And we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, by the plain, by Elath, and by Ezion-geber, and we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
\[9]And Jehovah said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither engage with them in battle; for I will not give thee of their land a possession; for unto the children of Lot have I given Ar as a possession.
\[10](The Emim dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall as the Anakim.
\[11]They also are reckoned as giants like the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.
\[12]And in Seir dwelt the Horites in times past; and the children of Esau dispossessed them, and destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did to the land of their possession, which Jehovah gave to them.)
\[13]Now rise up, and pass over the torrent Zered. And we passed over the torrent Zered.
\[14]Now the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we had come over the torrent Zered, were thirty-eight years; until the whole generation of the men of war was consumed from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah had sworn unto them.
\[15]Moreover the hand of Jehovah was against them to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.
\[16]And it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed, having died off from among the people,
\[17]that Jehovah spoke to me, saying,
\[18]Thou art to pass this day over the border of Moab, [which is] Ar,
\[19]and come near over against the children of Ammon; thou shalt not distress them nor attack them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon a possession; for unto the children of Lot have I given it as a possession.
\[20](That also is reckoned a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in time past, and the Ammonites call them Zamzummim;
\[21]a people great, and many, and tall as the Anakim; and Jehovah destroyed them before them, and they dispossessed them, and dwelt in their stead;
\[22]as he did to the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, from before whom he destroyed the Horites; and they dispossessed them, and dwelt in their stead, even to this day.
\[23]And the Avvites who dwelt in the hamlets as far as Gazah—the Caphtorim, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)
\[24]Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon. Behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the king of Heshbon, the Amorite, and his land: begin, take possession, and engage with him in battle.
\[25]This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples under the whole heaven; who will hear report of thee, and will tremble, and quake because of thee.
\[26]And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon the king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
\[27]Let me pass through thy land: by the highway alone will I go; I will neither turn to the right hand nor to the left.
\[28]Thou shalt sell me food for money that I may eat; and thou shalt give me water for money that I may drink; I will only pass through on my feet,
\[29]—as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me,—until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which Jehovah our God giveth us.
\[30]But Sihon the king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Jehovah thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obdurate, that he might give him into thy hand, as it is this day.
\[31]And Jehovah said to me, Behold, I begin to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin, take possession, that thou mayest possess his land.
\[32]And Sihon came out against us for battle, he and all his people, to Jahaz.
\[33]But Jehovah our God gave him up before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and his whole people.
\[34]And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every city, men, and women, and little ones: we let none escape.
\[35]Only the cattle we took as booty for ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.
\[36]From Aroer, which is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the ravine even to Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: Jehovah our God delivered all before us.
\[37]Only thou didst not approach the land of the children of Ammon, the whole border of the river Jabbok, nor the cities of the mountain, nor to whatsoever Jehovah our God had forbidden us.

nd we turned, and went up the way to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, for battle at Edrei.
\[2]And Jehovah said to me, Fear him not; for into thy hand have I given him, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.
\[3]And Jehovah our God gave into our hand Og the king of Bashan also, and all his people; and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.
\[4]And we took all his cities at that time: there was not a town which we took not from them, sixty cities, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\[5]All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides unwalled towns very many.
\[6]And we utterly destroyed them, as we had done to Sihon the king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every city, men, women and little ones.
\[7]But all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took as booty for ourselves.
\[8]And we took at that time the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites, that were on this side the Jordan, from the river Arnon to mount Hermon
\[9](the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir):
\[10]all the cities of the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, as far as Salchah and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\[11]For only Og the king of Bashan remained of the residue of giants: behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? its length was nine cubits, and its breadth four cubits, after the cubit of a man.
\[12]And this land we took in possession at that time. From Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and the half of mount Gilead, and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites;
\[13]and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob, even all Bashan, is called a land of giants.
\[14]Jair the son of Manasseh took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and called Bashan after his own name, Havoth-Jair, to this day.)
\[15]And I gave Gilead to Machir.
\[16]And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the river Arnon, the middle of the ravine and its border, as far as the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;
\[17]the plain also, and the Jordan, and [its] border from Chinnereth as far as the sea of the plain, the salt sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.
\[18]And I commanded you at that time, saying, Jehovah your God hath given you this land to take possession of it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all [who are] combatants.
\[19]Only your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle,—I know that ye have much cattle,—shall abide in your cities which I have given you,
\[20]until Jehovah give rest to your brethren, as well as to you, and they also take possession of the land that Jehovah your God giveth them beyond the Jordan; then shall ye return, each man to his possession, which I have given you.
\[21]And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done to these two kings: so will Jehovah do to all the kingdoms to which thou shalt go.
\[22]Ye shall not fear them; for Jehovah your God, he will fight for you.
\[23]And I besought Jehovah at that time, saying,
\[24]Lord Jehovah, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy powerful hand; for what God is in the heavens or in the earth that can do like to thy works, and like to thy might?
\[25]Let me go over, I pray thee, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
\[26]But Jehovah was wroth with me on your account, and did not hear me; and Jehovah said to me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter!
\[27]Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes; for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
\[28]But charge Joshua, and encourage him and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall put them in possession of the land which thou shalt see.

nd now, Israel, hearken to the statutes and to the ordinances which I teach you, to do [them], that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah the God of your fathers giveth you.
\[2]Ye shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall ye take from it, that ye may keep the commandments of Jehovah your God which I command you.
\[3]Your eyes have seen what Jehovah did because of Baal-Peor; for all the men that followed Baal-Peor, Jehovah thy God hath destroyed them from among you;
\[4]but ye that did cleave to Jehovah your God are alive every one of you this day.
\[5]See, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Jehovah my God commanded me, that ye may do so in the land into which ye enter to possess it.
\[6]And ye shall keep and do them; for that will be your wisdom and your understanding before the eyes of the peoples that shall hear all these statutes, and say, Verily this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
\[7]For what great nation is there that hath God near to them as Jehovah our God is in everything we call upon him for?
\[8]And what great nation is there that hath righteous statutes and ordinances, as all this law which I set before you this day?
\[9]Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things that thine eyes have seen (and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but thou shalt make them known to thy sons and to thy sons' sons),
\[10]the day that thou stoodest before Jehovah thy God in Horeb, when Jehovah said to me, Gather me the people together, that I may cause them to hear my words, that they may learn them, and fear me all the days that they live upon the earth, and teach them to their children.
\[11]And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and obscurity.
\[12]And Jehovah spoke to you from the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but ye saw no form; only [ye heard] a voice.
\[13]And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to do, the ten words; and he wrote them on two tables of stone.
\[14]And Jehovah commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that ye might do them in the land whither ye are passing over to possess it.
\[15]And take great heed to your souls (for ye saw no form on the day that Jehovah spoke to you in Horeb from the midst of the fire),
\[16]lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the form of any figure, the pattern of male or female,
\[17]the pattern of any beast that is on the earth, the pattern of any winged fowl that flieth in the heaven,
\[18]the pattern of anything that creepeth on the ground, the pattern of any fish that is in the waters under the earth;
\[19]and lest thou lift up thine eyes to the heavens, and see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, the whole host of heaven, and be drawn away and bow down to them and serve them, which Jehovah thy God hath assigned unto all peoples under the whole heaven.
\[20]But you hath Jehovah taken, and hath brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, that ye might be to him a people of inheritance, as it is this day.
\[21]And Jehovah was angry with me on your account, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not enter in to that good land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee [for] an inheritance;
\[22]for I shall die in this land, I shall not go over the Jordan; but ye shall go over, and possess this good land.
\[23]Take heed to yourselves lest ye forget the covenant of Jehovah your God, which he made with you, and make yourselves a graven image, the form of anything which Jehovah thy God hath forbidden thee.
\[24]For Jehovah thy God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
\[25]When thou begettest sons, and sons' sons, and ye have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, the form of anything, and do evil in the sight of Jehovah thy God, to provoke him to anger,
\[26]I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye pass over the Jordan to possess it: ye shall not prolong your days on it, but shall be utterly destroyed.
\[27]And Jehovah will scatter you among the peoples, and ye shall be left a small company among the nations to which Jehovah will lead you.
\[28]And ye shall there serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
\[29]And from thence ye shall seek Jehovah thy God, and thou shalt find him, if thou shalt seek him with thy whole heart and with thy whole soul.
\[30]In thy tribulation, and when all these things shall come upon thee, at the end of days, thou shalt return to Jehovah thy God, and shalt hearken to his voice,
\[31]—for Jehovah thy God is a merciful God,—he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he swore unto them.
\[32]For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man on the earth, and from one end of the heavens to the other end of the heavens, whether there hath been anything as this great thing is, or if anything hath been heard like it?
\[33]Did [ever] people hear the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?
\[34]Or hath God essayed to come to take him a nation from the midst of a nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a powerful hand, and by a stretched-out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Jehovah your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
\[35]Unto thee it was shewn, that thou mightest know that Jehovah, he is God—there is none other besides him.
\[36]From the heavens he made thee hear his voice, that he might instruct thee; and on the earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words from the midst of the fire.
\[37]And because he loved thy fathers, and chose their seed after them, he brought thee out with his countenance, with his great power, out of Egypt,
\[38]to dispossess nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.

\[41]Then Moses separated three cities on this side the Jordan toward the sun-rising,
\[42]that the manslayer might flee thither, who should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not previously, that fleeing to one of these cities, he might live:
\[43]Bezer in the wilderness, in the plateau, of the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.
\[44]And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:
\[45]these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances that Moses declared to the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt,
\[46]on this side the Jordan, in the valley opposite to Beth-Peor, in the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote when they came out of Egypt;
\[47]and they took possession of his land, and the land of Og the king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, who were on this side the Jordan, toward the sun-rising;
\[48]from Aroer, which is on the bank of the river Arnon, as far as mount Sion, which is Hermon,

\[3]Not with our fathers did Jehovah make this covenant, but with us, [even] us, those [who are] here alive all of us this day.
\[4]Face to face on the mountain from the midst of the fire Jehovah spoke with you
\[5](I stood between Jehovah and you at that time, to declare to you the word of Jehovah; for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up to the mountain), saying,
\[6]I am Jehovah thy God who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
\[7]Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
\[8]Thou shalt not make thyself any graven image, any form of what is in the heavens above, or what is in the earth beneath, or what is in the waters under the earth:
\[9]thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them; for I, Jehovah thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, and upon the third and upon the fourth [generation] of them that hate me,
\[10]and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
\[11]Thou shalt not idly utter the name of Jehovah thy God; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that idly uttereth his name.
\[12]Keep the sabbath day to hallow it, as Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee.
\[13]Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work;
\[14]but the seventh day is the sabbath of Jehovah thy God: thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy bondman, nor thy handmaid, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy sojourner that is within thy gates; that thy bondman and thy handmaid may rest as well as thou.
\[15]And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and that Jehovah thy God brought thee out thence with a powerful hand and with a stretched-out arm; therefore Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee to observe the sabbath day.
\[16]Honour thy father and thy mother, as Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may be well with thee in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.
\[17]Thou shalt not kill.
\[18]Neither shalt thou commit adultery.
\[19]Neither shalt thou steal.
\[20]Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.
\[21]Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, nor his bondman, nor his handmaid, his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbour's.
\[22]These words Jehovah spoke to all your congregation on the mountain from the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the obscurity, with a great voice, and he added no more; and he wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me.
\[23]And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, and the mountain burned with fire, that ye came near to me, all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
\[24]and ye said, Behold, Jehovah our God has shewn us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice from the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God talks with man, and he lives.
\[25]And now, why should we die? for this great fire will consume us. If we hear the voice of Jehovah our God any more, we shall die.
\[26]For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we, and has lived?
\[27]Come thou near, and hear all that Jehovah our God will say; and speak thou to us all that Jehovah our God will speak to thee; and we will hear it, and do it.
\[28]And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke to me; and Jehovah said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people that have spoken to thee: they have well spoken all that they have spoken.
\[29]Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments continually, that it might be well with them and with their sons for ever!
\[30]Go, say unto them, Get you into your tents again.
\[31]But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.
\[32]Take heed then to do as Jehovah your God hath commanded you: turn not aside to the right hand or to the left.
\[33]In all the way that Jehovah your God hath commanded you shall ye walk, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.

\[22]and Jehovah shewed signs and wonders, great and grievous, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes;
\[23]and he brought us out thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore unto our fathers.
\[24]And Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Jehovah our God, for our good continually, that he might preserve us alive, as it is this day.

\[2]and when Jehovah thy God shall give them up before thee and thou shalt smite them, then shalt thou utterly destroy them: thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them.
\[3]And thou shalt make no marriages with them: thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor take his daughter for thy son;
\[4]for he will turn away thy son from following me, and they will serve other gods, and the anger of Jehovah will be kindled against you, and he will destroy thee quickly.
\[5]But thus shall ye deal with them: ye shall break down their altars, and shatter their statues, and hew down their Asherahs, and burn their graven images with fire.
\[6]For a holy people art thou unto Jehovah thy God: Jehovah thy God hath chosen thee to be unto him a people for a possession, above all the peoples that are upon the face of the earth.
\[7]Not because ye were more in number than all the peoples, hath Jehovah been attached to you and chosen you, for ye are the fewest of all the peoples;
\[8]but because Jehovah loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath Jehovah brought you out with a powerful hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
\[9]And thou shalt know that Jehovah thy God, he is God, the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and mercy to a thousand generations with them that love him and keep his commandments;
\[10]and repayeth them that hate him [each] to his face, to cause them to perish: he delayeth not with him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.
\[11]And thou shalt keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command thee this day, to do them.
\[12]And it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these ordinances, and keep and do them, that Jehovah thy God will keep with thee the covenant and the mercy which he swore unto thy fathers;
\[13]and he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee, and will bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy ground, thy corn and thy new wine, and thine oil, the offspring of thy kine, and the increase of thy sheep, in the land which he swore unto thy fathers to give thee.
\[14]Thou shalt be blessed above all the peoples; there shall not be male or female barren with thee, or with thy cattle;
\[15]and Jehovah will take away from thee all sickness, and none of the evil infirmities of Egypt, which thou knowest, will he put upon thee; but he will lay them upon all them that hate thee.
\[16]And thou shalt consume all the peoples that Jehovah thy God will give up unto thee; thine eye shall not spare them, and thou shalt not serve their gods; for that would be a snare unto thee.
\[17]If thou shouldest say in thy heart, These nations are greater than I; how can I dispossess them?
\[18]fear them not; remember well what Jehovah thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all the Egyptians;
\[19]the great trials which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the powerful hand, and the stretched-out arm, whereby Jehovah thy God brought thee out: so will Jehovah thy God do unto all the peoples whom thou fearest.
\[20]Moreover, Jehovah thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and they that hide themselves from thee, are destroyed.
\[21]Thou shalt not be afraid of them; for Jehovah thy God is in thy midst, a God great and terrible.

\[24]And he will give their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt put out their name from under the heavens; no man shall stand before thee, until thou hast destroyed them.
\[25]The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire; thou shalt not covet the silver and gold [that is] on them and take it unto thee, lest thou be ensnared therein; for it is an abomination to Jehovah thy God.
\[26]And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.

\[2]And thou shalt remember all the way which Jehovah thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or not.
\[3]And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with the manna, which thou hadst not known, and which thy fathers knew not; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread alone, but by everything that goeth out of the mouth of Jehovah doth man live.

\[6]and thou shalt keep the commandments of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
\[7]For Jehovah thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of water-brooks, of springs, and of deep waters, that gush forth in the valleys and hills;
\[8]a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig-trees, and pomegranates; a land of olive-trees and honey;
\[9]a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, where thou shalt lack nothing; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose mountains thou wilt dig copper.
\[10]And thou shalt eat and be filled, and shalt bless Jehovah thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.
\[11]Beware that thou forget not Jehovah thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command thee this day;
\[12]lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built and inhabited fine houses,
\[13]and thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied,

\[15]who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness, [a wilderness of] fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there is no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;
\[16]who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;
\[17]—and thou say in thy heart, My power and the might of my hand has procured me this wealth.
\[18]But thou shalt remember Jehovah thy God, that it is he who giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore unto thy fathers, as it is this day.
\[19]And it shall be, if thou do at all forget Jehovah thy God, and go after other gods, and serve them, and bow down to them, I testify against you this day that ye shall utterly perish.

\[2]a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard [say], Who can stand before the sons of Anak!
\[3]Know then this day, that Jehovah thy God is he that goeth over before thee, a consuming fire; he will destroy them, and he will cast them down before thee, and thou shalt dispossess them and cause them to perish quickly, as Jehovah hath said unto thee.
\[4]Thou shalt not say in thy heart, when Jehovah thy God thrusteth them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness Jehovah hath brought me in to possess this land; but for the wickedness of these nations doth Jehovah dispossess them from before thee.
\[5]Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart, dost thou enter in to possess their land, but for the wickedness of these nations doth Jehovah thy God dispossess them from before thee, and that he may perform the word which Jehovah swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
\[6]Know therefore that Jehovah thy God doth not give thee this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiff-necked people.
\[7]Remember, forget not, how thou provokedst Jehovah thy God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came to this place, ye have been rebellious against Jehovah.
\[8]And at Horeb ye provoked Jehovah to wrath, and Jehovah was angry with you, to destroy you,
\[9]when I went up the mountain to receive the tables of stone, the tables of the covenant which Jehovah made with you, and I abode in the mountain forty days and forty nights,—I ate no bread and drank no water,—
\[10]—and Jehovah delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them [was written] according to all the words which Jehovah spoke with you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly.
\[11]And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Jehovah gave me the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant.
\[12]And Jehovah said unto me, Arise, go down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them: they have made for themselves a molten image.
\[13]And Jehovah spoke unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.
\[14]Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.
\[15]And I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire; and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.
\[16]And I saw, and behold, ye had sinned against Jehovah your God: ye had made for yourselves a molten calf; ye had quickly turned aside from the way which Jehovah had commanded you.
\[17]And I seized the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.
\[18]And I fell down before Jehovah, as at the first, forty days and forty nights,—I ate no bread and drank no water,—because of all your sin which ye had sinned, in doing what is evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
\[19]For I was afraid of the anger and fury wherewith Jehovah was wroth against you to destroy you. And Jehovah listened unto me also at that time.
\[20]And with Aaron Jehovah was very angry to destroy him; and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
\[21]And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burned it with fire, and crushed it, and ground it very small, until it became fine dust; and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that flowed down from the mountain.
\[22]And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked Jehovah to wrath.
\[23]And when Jehovah sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and take possession of the land which I have given you, ye rebelled against the word of Jehovah your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.
\[24]Ye have been rebellious against Jehovah from the day that I knew you.
\[25]So I fell down before Jehovah the forty days and forty nights, as I fell down; for Jehovah had said he would destroy you.
\[26]I prayed therefore to Jehovah, and said, Lord Jehovah, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a powerful hand.
\[27]Remember thy servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not at the stubbornness of this people, nor at their wickedness, nor at their sin;
\[28]lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because Jehovah was not able to bring them into the land which he had promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.
\[29]They are indeed thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out with thy great power and with thy stretched-out arm.

\[3]And I made an ark of acacia-wood, and hewed two tables of stone like the first, and went up the mountain with the two tables in my hand.

\[7]From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of water-brooks.)
\[8]At that time Jehovah separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to do service unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.
\[9]Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah is his inheritance, according as Jehovah thy God told him.

\[11]And Jehovah said unto me, Rise up, take thy journey before the people, that they may enter in and possess the land, which I swore unto their fathers to give unto them.
\[12]And now, Israel, what doth Jehovah thy God require of thee, but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,
\[13]to keep the commandments of Jehovah, and his statutes, which I command thee this day, for thy good?

\[10]For the land, whither thou enterest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs;
\[11]but the land, whereunto ye are passing over to possess it, is a land of mountains and valleys, which drinketh water of the rain of heaven,
\[12]a land which Jehovah thy God careth for; the eyes of Jehovah thy God are constantly upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.
\[13]And it shall come to pass, if ye hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love Jehovah your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,

\[18]And ye shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.
\[19]And ye shall teach them unto your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou goest on the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up;
\[20]and write them upon the posts of thy house, and upon thy gates;
\[21]that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Jehovah swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens [which are] above the earth.
\[22]For if ye diligently keep all this commandment which I command you [this day] to do it, to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him,
\[23]then will Jehovah dispossess all these nations from before you, and ye shall take possession of nations greater and mightier than yourselves.

\[25]No man shall be able to stand before you: the fear of you and the dread of you will Jehovah your God lay upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.

\[27]a blessing, if ye obey the commandments of Jehovah your God, which I command you this day;

\[2]Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall dispossess have served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree;
\[3]and ye shall break down their altars, and shatter their statues, and burn their Asherahs with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and ye shall destroy the names of them out of that place.
\[4]Ye shall not do so unto Jehovah your God;
\[5]but unto the place which Jehovah your God will choose out of all your tribes to set his name there, his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come;
\[6]and thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and your vows, and your voluntary-offerings, and the firstlings of your kine and of your sheep;
\[7]and ye shall eat there before Jehovah your God, and ye shall rejoice, ye and your households, in all the business of your hand, wherein Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee.
\[8]Ye shall not do after all that we do here this day, each one whatever is right in his own eyes.
\[9]For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.
\[10]But when ye have gone over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which Jehovah your God causeth you to inherit, and when he hath given you rest from all your enemies round about, and ye dwell in safety,
\[11]then there shall be a place which Jehovah your God will choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you: your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye shall vow to Jehovah.
\[12]And ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your bondmen, and your handmaids, and the Levite that is within your gates; for he hath no portion nor inheritance with you.
\[13]Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest;
\[14]but in the place which Jehovah will choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.
\[15]Nevertheless, according to all the desire of thy soul thou mayest slay and eat flesh in all thy gates, according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the gazelle, and the hart.
\[16]Only, ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water.
\[17]Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy new wine, or of thine oil, or the firstlings of thy kine or of thy sheep, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy voluntary-offerings, nor the heave-offering of thy hand;
\[18]but before Jehovah thy God shalt thou eat them in the place which Jehovah thy God will choose, thou and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy bondman, and thy handmaid, and the Levite that is within thy gates; and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God in all the business of thy hand.
\[19]Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite all the days thou shalt be in thy land.
\[20]When Jehovah thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he promised thee, and thou say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh, thou mayest eat flesh, according to all the desire of thy soul.
\[21]If the place which Jehovah thy God will choose to set his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt slay of thy kine and of thy sheep which Jehovah hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates according to all the desire of thy soul.
\[22]Even as the gazelle and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean alike may eat of them.
\[23]Only, be sure that thou eat not the blood; for the blood is the life, and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh;
\[24]thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water:
\[25]thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do what is right in the eyes of Jehovah.
\[26]But thy hallowed things which thou hast, and what thou hast vowed, thou shalt take, and come to the place which Jehovah will choose;
\[27]and thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of Jehovah thy God; and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of Jehovah thy God, and the flesh shalt thou eat.
\[28]Take heed to hear all these words which I command thee, that it may be well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest what is good and right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God.
\[29]When Jehovah thy God cutteth off from before thee the nations whither thou goest, to take possession of them, and thou hast dispossessed them, and dwellest in their land,
\[30]take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared [to follow] after them, after that they are destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.
\[31]Thou shalt not do so to Jehovah thy God; for every [thing that is] abomination to Jehovah, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters have they burned in the fire to their gods.
\[32]Everything that I command you, ye shall take heed to do it; thou shalt not add thereto, nor take from it.

\[3]and shall say unto them, Hear, Israel, ye are approaching this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be afraid of them;
\[4]for Jehovah your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.
\[5]And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.
\[6]And what man is there that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not eaten of it? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.
\[7]And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.
\[8]And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and shall say, What man is there that is timid and faint-hearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart melt as well as his heart.
\[9]And it shall be, when the officers have ended speaking unto the people, that they shall place captains of the hosts at the head of the people.
\[10]When thou approachest unto a city to fight against it, thou shalt proclaim peace unto it.
\[11]And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then all the people that are found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.
\[12]And if it will not make peace with thee, but will make war with thee, then thou shalt besiege it;
\[13]and when Jehovah thy God delivereth it into thy hand, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:
\[14]only the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that shall be in the city, all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take as booty for thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee
\[15]Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities that are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.
\[16]But of the cities of these peoples which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth,
\[17]but shalt utterly devote them to destruction, the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, as Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee;
\[18]that they teach you not to do according to all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods, so that ye sin against Jehovah your God.
\[19]When thou shalt besiege a city many days, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by lifting up an axe against them; for thou canst eat of them; and thou shalt not cut them down, for is the tree of the field a man that it should be besieged?
\[20]Only the trees which thou knowest are not trees for meat, thou mayest destroy and cut them down, and build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it fall.

\[4]and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto an ever-flowing watercourse, which is not tilled, nor is it sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the watercourse;
\[5]and the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Jehovah thy God hath chosen to do service unto him, and to bless in the name of Jehovah; and according to their word shall be every controversy and every stroke.
\[6]And all the elders of that city, that are nearest unto him that is slain, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck is broken in the watercourse,

\[8]Forgive thy people Israel, whom thou, Jehovah, hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood to the charge of thy people Israel; and the blood shall be expiated for them.

\[17]but he shall acknowledge as firstborn the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that is found with him; for he is the firstfruits of his vigour: the right of the firstborn is his.
\[18]If a man have an unmanageable and rebellious son, who hearkeneth not unto the voice of his father, nor unto the voice of his mother, and they have chastened him, but he hearkeneth not unto them;
\[19]then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;
\[20]and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is unmanageable and rebellious, he hearkeneth not unto our voice; he is a profligate and a drunkard.
\[21]And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die. And thou shalt put evil away from thy midst; and all Israel shall hear and fear.
\[22]And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou have hanged him on a tree,
\[23]his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day (for he that is hanged is a curse of God); and thou shalt not defile thy land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.

\[19]and they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath caused an evil name to be spread abroad against a virgin in Israel. And she shall remain his wife: he may not put her away all his days.
\[20]But if this thing is true, [and] virginity hath not been found with the damsel;
\[21]then they shall bring out the damsel unto the entrance of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought infamy in Israel, committing fornication in her father's house; and thou shalt put evil away from thy midst.

\[12]Jehovah will open to thee his good treasure, the heavens, to give rain unto thy land in its season, and to bless all the work of thy hand; and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow.
\[13]And Jehovah will make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if thou hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah thy God, which I command thee this day, to keep and to do them,
\[14]and if thou turn not aside from any of the words that I command thee this day, to the right hand or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
\[15]But it shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to take heed to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day, that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee.
\[16]Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field.
\[17]Cursed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough.
\[18]Cursed shall be the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy ground, the offspring of thy kine, and the increase of thy sheep.
\[19]Cursed shalt thou be in thy coming in, and cursed shalt thou be in thy going out.
\[20]Jehovah will send upon thee cursing, confusion, and rebuke, in all the business of thy hand which thou doest, until thou be destroyed and until thou perish quickly, because of the wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.
\[21]Jehovah will make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have consumed thee from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.
\[22]Jehovah will smite thee with consumption, and with fever, and with inflammation, and with burning ague, and with drought, and with blight, and with mildew, and they shall pursue thee until thou perish.
\[23]And thy heavens which are over thy head shall be brass, and the earth which is under thee, iron.
\[24]Jehovah will give as the rain of thy land powder and dust; from the heavens shall it come down upon thee until thou be destroyed.
\[25]Jehovah will give thee up smitten before thine enemies; thou shalt go out against them one way, and by seven ways shalt thou flee before them; and thou shalt be driven hither and thither into all the kingdoms of the earth.
\[26]And thy carcase shall be meat unto all the fowl of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and there shall be no man to scare them away.
\[27]Jehovah will smite thee with the ulcers of Egypt, and with boils, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed.
\[28]Jehovah will smite thee with madness, and with blindness, and with astonishment of heart;
\[29]and thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways; and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled continually, and there shall be none to save.
\[30]Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her; thou shalt build a house, and thou shalt not dwell therein; thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not eat of it.
\[31]Thine ox shall be slaughtered before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof; thine ass shall be snatched away from before thy face, and shall not return to thee; thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to recover them.
\[32]Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and thine eyes shall look, and languish for them all the day long; and there shall be no power in thy hand [to help it].
\[33]The fruit of thy ground and all thy labour, shall a people that thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed continually.
\[34]And thou shalt be mad through the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.
\[35]Jehovah will smite thee in the knees and in the legs with evil ulcers, whereof thou canst not be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head.
\[36]Jehovah will bring thee, and thy king whom thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation that neither thou nor thy fathers have known, and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.
\[37]And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples whither Jehovah shall lead thee.
\[38]Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather little in; for the locust shall devour it.
\[39]Thou shalt plant and till vineyards, but shalt drink no wine, nor gather [the fruit]; for the worms shall eat it.
\[40]Olive-trees shalt thou have throughout all thy borders, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with oil; for thine olive-tree shall cast its fruit.
\[41]Sons and daughters shalt thou beget, but thou shalt not have them [to be with thee]; for they shall go into captivity.
\[42]All thy trees and the fruit of thy ground shall the locust possess.
\[43]The sojourner that is in thy midst shall rise above thee higher and higher, and thou shalt sink down lower and lower.
\[44]He shall lend to thee, but thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.
\[45]And all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, until thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee.
\[46]And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.
\[47]Because thou servedst not Jehovah thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of everything,
\[48]thou shalt serve thine enemies whom Jehovah will send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of everything; and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.
\[49]Jehovah will bring a nation against thee from afar, from the end of the earth, like as the eagle flieth, a nation whose tongue thou understandest not;
\[50]a nation of fierce countenance, which regardeth not the person of the old, nor is kind to the young;
\[51]and he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy ground, until thou be destroyed; for he shall not leave thee corn, new wine, or oil, offspring of thy kine, or increase of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.
\[52]And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and strong walls wherein thou trustedst come down, throughout all thy land; and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates in all thy land, which Jehovah thy God hath given thee.
\[53]And in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee, thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters whom Jehovah thy God hath given thee.
\[54]The eye of the man in thy midst that is tender and very luxurious shall be evil towards his brother, and the wife of his bosom, and the residue of his children which he hath left;
\[55]so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children that he eateth, because he hath nothing left him in the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.
\[56]The eye of the tender and luxurious woman in thy midst who would not attempt to set the sole of her foot upon the ground from luxuriousness and from tenderness, shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and her son, and her daughter,
\[57]because of her afterbirth which hath come out between her feet, and her children whom she shall bear; for she shall secretly eat them for want of everything in the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.
\[58]If thou wilt not take heed to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, to fear this glorious and fearful name, JEHOVAH THY GOD;
\[59]then Jehovah will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, great and persistent plagues and evil and persistent sicknesses;
\[60]and he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt which thou art afraid of, and they shall cleave unto thee.
\[61]Also every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book of this law, them will Jehovah bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.
\[62]And ye shall be left a small company, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou hast not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah thy God.
\[63]And it shall come to pass, that as Jehovah rejoiced over you to do you good and to multiply you, so Jehovah will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whereunto thou goest to possess it.
\[64]And Jehovah will scatter thee among all peoples, from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; and thou shalt there serve other gods, whom thou hast not known, neither thou nor thy fathers, wood and stone.
\[65]And among these nations shalt thou have no rest, neither shall the sole of thy foot have a resting-place, and Jehovah shall give thee there a trembling heart, languishing of the eyes, and pining of the soul.
\[66]And thy life shall hang in suspense before thee; and thou shalt be in terror day and night and shalt be afraid of thy life.
\[67]In the morning thou shalt say, Would that it were even! and in the evening thou shalt say, Would that it were morning! through the fright of thy heart wherewith thou shalt be in terror, and through the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.
\[68]And Jehovah will bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I said unto thee, Thou shalt see it again no more; and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and there shall be no man to buy [you].

hese are the words of the covenant that Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant that he made with them in Horeb.
\[2]And Moses called to all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that Jehovah did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his bondmen, and to all his land:
\[3]the great trials that thine eyes have seen, those great signs and wonders.
\[4]But Jehovah hath not given you a heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.
\[5]And I have led you forty years in the wilderness; your clothes are not grown old upon you, and thy sandal is not grown old upon thy foot;
\[6]ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink, that ye might know that I am Jehovah your God.
\[7]And ye came to this place; and Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out against us for battle, and we smote them.
\[8]And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of the Manassites.
\[9]Ye shall keep then the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.
\[10]Ye stand this day all of you before Jehovah your God: your chiefs [of] your tribes, your elders, and your officers, all the men of Israel,
\[11]your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, as well the hewer of thy wood as the drawer of thy water;
\[12]that thou mayest enter into the covenant of Jehovah thy God, and into his oath, which Jehovah thy God maketh with thee this day;
\[13]that he may establish thee this day for a people unto himself, and [that] he may be to thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
\[14]Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath,
\[15]but with him that standeth here with us this day before Jehovah our God, and with him that is not here with us this day
\[16](for ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the nations which ye passed;
\[17]and ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them);
\[18]lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from Jehovah our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood,
\[19]and it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to sweep away the drunken with the thirsty.
\[20]Jehovah will not pardon him, but the anger of Jehovah and his jealousy will then smoke against that man, and all the curse shall be upon him that is written in this book; and Jehovah will blot out his name from under the heavens;
\[21]and Jehovah will separate him for mischief out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law.
\[22]And the generation to come, your children who shall rise up after you, and the foreigner that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and its sicknesses wherewith Jehovah hath visited it,
\[23][that] the whole ground thereof is brimstone and salt, [and] burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, and no grass groweth in it, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger and in his fury:
\[24]even all nations shall say, Why has Jehovah done thus to this land? whence the heat of this great anger?
\[25]And men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of Jehovah the God of their fathers, which he had made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt;
\[26]and they went and served other gods, and bowed down to them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not assigned to them.
\[27]And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book;
\[28]and Jehovah rooted them out of their land in anger, and in fury, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as [it appears] this day.
\[29]The hidden things belong to Jehovah our God; but the revealed ones are ours and our children's for ever, to do all the words of this law.

\[2]and shalt return to Jehovah thy God, and shalt hearken to his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy sons, with all thy heart and with all thy soul;
\[3]that then Jehovah thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will gather thee again from all the peoples whither Jehovah thy God hath scattered thee.
\[4]Though there were of you driven out unto the end of the heavens, from thence will Jehovah thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee;
\[5]and Jehovah thy God will bring thee into the land that thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.
\[6]And Jehovah thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.
\[7]And Jehovah thy God will put all these curses on thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, who have persecuted thee.
\[8]But thou shalt return and hearken to the voice of Jehovah, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.
\[9]And Jehovah thy God will make thee abound in every work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, for good; for Jehovah will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers;
\[10]if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if thou turn to Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
\[11]For this commandment which I command thee this day is not too wonderful for thee, neither is it far off.
\[12]It is not in the heavens, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to the heavens, and bring it to us, that we should hear it and do it?
\[13]And it is not beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, that we should hear it and do it?
\[14]For the word is very near to thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.
\[15]See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil,
\[16]in that I command thee this day to love Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, that thou mayest live and multiply, and that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
\[17]But if thy heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and thou shalt bow down to other gods and serve them;
\[18]I denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish; ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whereunto thou passest over the Jordan to possess it.
\[19]I call heaven and earth to witness this day against you: life and death have I set before you, blessing and cursing: choose then life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed,
\[20]in loving Jehovah thy God, in hearkening to his voice, and in cleaving to him—for this is thy life and the length of thy days—that thou mayest dwell in the land which Jehovah swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

nd Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel;
\[2]and he said unto them, I am a hundred and twenty years old this day, I can no more go out and come in; and Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
\[3]Jehovah thy God, he will go over before thee, he will destroy these nations from before thee, that thou mayest take possession of them: Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as Jehovah hath said.
\[4]And Jehovah will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land; whom he destroyed.
\[5]And when Jehovah giveth them up before you, ye shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you.
\[6]Be strong and courageous, fear them not, neither be afraid of them; for Jehovah thy God, he it is that goeth with thee; he will not leave thee, nor forsake thee.
\[7]And Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and courageous, for thou must go with this people into the land which Jehovah hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.
\[8]And Jehovah, he it is that goeth before thee: he will be with thee; he will not leave thee, nor forsake thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.
\[9]And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and to all the elders of Israel.
\[10]And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, at the set time of the year of release, at the feast of tabernacles,
\[11]when all Israel cometh to appear before Jehovah thy God in the place which he will choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their ears.
\[12]Gather the people together, the men, and the women, and the children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Jehovah your God, and take heed to do all the words of this law;
\[13]and that their children who do not know it may hear it and learn, that they may fear Jehovah your God, as long as ye live in the land, whereunto ye pass over the Jordan to possess it.
\[14]And Jehovah said to Moses, Lo, the days are near for thee to die; call Joshua, and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting.
\[15]And Jehovah appeared at the tent in the pillar of cloud; and the pillar of cloud stood over the entrance to the tent.
\[16]And Jehovah said to Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the strange gods of the land into which they enter, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
\[17]And my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them, and they will say in that day, Have not these evils befallen me because my God is not in my midst?
\[18]And I will entirely hide my face in that day for all the evils that they have wrought, because they turned unto other gods.
\[19]And now, write ye this song, and teach it to the children of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
\[20]For I shall bring them into the land which I swore unto their fathers, which floweth with milk and honey; and they will eat and fill themselves, and wax fat, and will turn unto other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.
\[21]And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles have befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed; for I know their imagination which they are forming already this day, before I bring them into the land which I have sworn [unto them].
\[22]And Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel.
\[23]And [Jehovah] commanded Joshua the son of Nun, and said, Be strong and courageous; for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I have sworn unto them; and I will be with thee.
\[24]And it came to pass, when Moses had ended writing the words of this law in a book, until their conclusion,
\[25]that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, saying,
\[26]Take this book of the law, and put it at the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee;
\[27]for I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck. Lo, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against Jehovah; and how much more after my death!
\[28]Gather to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and take heaven and earth to witness against them.
\[29]For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and will turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and mischief will befall you at the end of days; because ye do evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.
\[30]And Moses spoke in the ears of the whole congregation of Israel the words of this song, until their conclusion.

ive ear, ye heavens, and I will speak; And hear, O earth, the words of my mouth!
\[2]My doctrine shall drop as rain, My speech flow down as dew, As small rain upon the tender herb, And as showers on the grass.
\[3]For the name of Jehovah will I proclaim: Ascribe greatness unto our God!
\[4][He is] the Rock, his work is perfect, For all his ways are righteousness; A God of faithfulness without deceit, Just and right is he.
\[5]They have dealt corruptly with him; Not his children's is their spot:—A crooked and perverted generation!
\[6]Do ye thus requite Jehovah, Foolish and unwise people? Is not he thy father that hath bought thee? Hath he not made thee and established thee?
\[7]Remember the days of old, Consider the years of generation to generation; Ask thy father, and he will shew thee; Thine elders, and they will tell thee.
\[8]When the Most High assigned to the nations their inheritance, When he separated the sons of Adam, He set the bounds of the peoples According to the number of the children of Israel.
\[9]For Jehovah's portion is his people; Jacob the lot of his inheritance.
\[10]He found him in a desert land, And in the waste, howling wilderness; He compassed him about, he watched over him, He preserved him as the apple of his eye.
\[11]As the eagle stirreth up its nest, Hovereth over its young, Spreadeth out its wings, Taketh them, beareth them on its feathers,
\[12]So Jehovah alone did lead him, And no strange god [was] with him.
\[13]He made him ride on the high places of the earth, And he ate the produce of the field; And he made him suck honey out of the crag, And oil out of the flinty rock;
\[14]Cream of kine, and milk of sheep, With the fat of lambs, And rams of the breed of Bashan, and he-goats, With the fat of kidneys of wheat; And thou didst drink pure wine, the blood of the grape.
\[15]Then Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked—Thou art waxen fat, Thou art grown thick, And thou art covered with fatness;—He gave up +God who made him, And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
\[16]They moved him to jealousy with strange gods, With abominations did they provoke him to anger.
\[17]They sacrificed unto demons who are not +God; To gods whom they knew not, To new ones, who came newly up, Whom your fathers revered not.
\[18]Of the Rock that begot thee wast thou unmindful, And thou hast forgotten God who brought thee forth.
\[19]And Jehovah saw it, and despised them, Because of the provoking of his sons and of his daughters.
\[20]And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be; For they are a perverse generation, Children in whom is no faithfulness.
\[21]They have moved me to jealousy with that which is no God; They have exasperated me with their vanities; And I will move them to jealousy with that which is not a people; With a foolish nation will I provoke them to anger.
\[22]For a fire is kindled in mine anger, And it shall burn into the lowest Sheol, And shall consume the earth and its produce, And set fire to the foundations of the mountains.
\[23]I will heap mischiefs upon them; Mine arrows will I spend against them.
\[24]They shall be consumed with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, And with poisonous pestilence; And the teeth of beasts will I send against them, With the poison of what crawleth in the dust.
\[25]From without shall the sword bereave them, and in the chambers, terror—Both the young man and the virgin, The suckling with the man of gray hairs.
\[26]I would say, I will scatter, I will make the remembrance of them to cease from among men,
\[27]If I did not fear provocation from the enemy, Lest their adversaries should misunderstand it, Lest they should say, Our hand is high, and Jehovah has not done all this.
\[28]For they are a nation void of counsel, And understanding is not in them.
\[29]Oh that they had been wise! they would have understood this, They would have considered their latter end!
\[30]How could one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Were it not that their Rock had sold them, And Jehovah had delivered them up?
\[31]For their rock is not as our Rock: Let our enemies themselves be judges.
\[32]For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, And of the fields of Gomorrah: Their grapes are grapes of poison, Bitter are their clusters;
\[33]Their wine is the poison of dragons, And the cruel venom of vipers.
\[34]Is not this hidden with me, Sealed up among my treasures?
\[35]Vengeance is mine, and recompense, For the time when their foot shall slip. For the day of their calamity is at hand, And the things that shall come upon them make haste.
\[36]For Jehovah will judge his people, And shall repent in favour of his servants; When he seeth that power is gone, And there is none shut up or left.
\[37]And he shall say, Where are their gods, Their rock in whom they trusted,
\[38]Who ate the fat of their sacrifices, [And] drank the wine of their drink-offering? Let them rise up and help you, That there may be a protection over you.
\[39]See now that I, I am HE, And there is no god with me; I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal, And there is none that delivereth out of my hand,
\[40]For I lift up my hand to the heavens, and say, I live for ever!
\[41]If I have sharpened my gleaming sword, And my hand take hold of judgment, I will render vengeance to mine adversaries, And will recompense them that hate me.
\[42]Mine arrows will I make drunk with blood, And my sword shall devour flesh; [I will make them drunk] with the blood of the slain and of the captives, With the head of the princes of the enemy.
\[43]Shout for joy, ye nations, with his people, For he avengeth the blood of his servants, And rendereth vengeance to his enemies, And maketh atonement for his land, for his people.
\[44]And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Hoshea the son of Nun.
\[45]And when Moses had ended speaking all these words to all Israel,
\[46]he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words that I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to take heed to do, all the words of this law.
\[47]For it is no vain word for you, but it is your life, and through this word ye shall prolong your days on the land whereunto ye pass over the Jordan to possess it.

\[49]Go up into this mountain Abarim, mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, which is opposite Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession,
\[50]and die on the mountain whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy peoples, as Aaron thy brother died on mount Hor, and was gathered unto his peoples;
\[51]because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye hallowed me not in the midst of the children of Israel.

\[10]They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances, And Israel thy law: They shall put incense before thy nostrils, And whole burnt-offering upon thine altar.
\[11]Bless, Jehovah, his substance! And let the work of his hands please thee; Crush the loins of his adversaries, And of them that hate him, that they may never rise again!
\[12]Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of Jehovah,—he shall dwell in safety by him; He will cover him all the day long, And dwell between his shoulders.
\[13]And of Joseph he said, Blessed of Jehovah be his land! By the precious things of the heavens, By the dew, and by the deep that lieth beneath,
\[14]And by the precious fruits of the sun, And by the precious things put forth by the months,
\[15]And by the best things of the ancient mountains, And by the precious things of the everlasting hills,
\[16]And by the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof. And let the good will of him that dwelt in the bush Come upon the head of Joseph, Upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.
\[17]His majesty is as the firstling of his ox; And his horns are as the horns of a buffalo. With them shall he push the peoples Together to the ends of the earth. These are the myriads of Ephraim, And these are the thousands of Manasseh.
\[18]And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; And thou, Issachar, in thy tents!
\[19]They shall invite [the] peoples to the mountain; There they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness; For they will suck the abundance of the seas, And the hidden treasures of the sand.
\[20]And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad! As a lion doth he dwell, and teareth the arm, even the top of the head.
\[21]And he provided the first part for himself, For there was reserved the portion of the lawgiver; And he came with the heads of the people; The justice of Jehovah and his judgments Hath he executed with Israel.
\[22]And of Dan he said, Dan is a young lion; He shall spring forth from Bashan.
\[23]And of Naphtali he said, Naphtali, satisfied with favour, And full of the blessing of Jehovah, Possess thou the west and the south.
\[24]And of Asher he said, Asher shall be blessed with sons; Let him be acceptable to his brethren, And let him dip his foot in oil.
\[25]Iron and brass shall be thy bolts; And thy rest as thy days.
\[26]There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, Who rideth upon the heavens to thy help, And in his majesty, upon the clouds.
\[27][Thy] refuge is the God of old, And underneath are the eternal arms; And he shall drive out the enemy from before thee, And shall say, Destroy [them]!
\[28]And Israel shall dwell in safety alone, The fountain of Jacob, in a land of corn and new wine; Also his heavens shall drop down dew.
\[29]Happy art thou, Israel! Who is like unto thee, a people saved by Jehovah, The shield of thy help, And the sword of thine excellency? And thine enemies shall come cringing to thee; And thou shalt tread upon their high places.

\[3]and the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm-trees, to Zoar.

\[5]And Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of Jehovah.
\[6]And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-Peor; and no man knows his sepulchre to this day.
\[7]And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
\[8]And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; and the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.
\[9]And Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
\[10]And there arose no prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom Jehovah had known face to face;
\[11]according to all the signs and wonders that Jehovah had sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;
\[12]and according to all that mighty hand; and according to all the great terribleness that Moses had wrought in the sight of all Israel.

\[2]Moses my servant is dead; and now, rise up, go over this Jordan, thou and all this people, into the land which I give unto them, to the children of Israel.
\[3]Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread have I given to you, as I said unto Moses.
\[4]From the wilderness and this Lebanon to the great river, the river Euphrates, the whole land of the Hittites, to the great sea, toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.
\[5]None shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee; I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee.
\[6]Be strong and courageous, for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I have sworn unto their fathers to give them.
\[7]Only be strong and very courageous, that thou mayest take heed to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded thee. Turn not from it to the right or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.
\[8]This book of the law shall not depart from thy mouth; and thou shalt meditate upon it day and night, that thou mayest take heed to do according to all that is written therein; for then shalt thou have good success in thy ways, and then shalt thou prosper.
\[9]Have I not commanded thee: Be strong and courageous? Be not afraid, neither be dismayed; for Jehovah thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.
\[10]And Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
\[11]Go through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare yourselves victuals, for in three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, that ye may enter in to take possession of the land which Jehovah your God giveth you to possess it.
\[12]And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to half the tribe of Manasseh spoke Joshua, saying,
\[13]Remember the word that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God has given you rest and has given you this land.
\[14]Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall abide in the land that Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan, but ye, all the valiant men, shall go over in array before your brethren and help them,
\[15]until Jehovah give your brethren rest as to you, and they also take possession of the land which Jehovah your God giveth them; then shall ye return into the land of your possession and possess it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you on this side of the Jordan toward the sun-rising.
\[16]And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us will we do, and whither thou shalt send us will we go.
\[17]According as we hearkened to Moses in all things, so will we hearken to thee; only may Jehovah thy God be with thee as he was with Moses.
\[18]Every one that is rebellious against thy commandment and hearkeneth not to thy words in everything that thou commandest us, shall be put to death. Only be strong and courageous.

\[2]And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, men have come hither to-night from the children of Israel to search out the land.
\[3]And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that have come to thee, who have come into thy house: for they have come to search out all the land.
\[4]And the woman had taken and concealed the two men; and she said, Yes, the men did come unto me, but I knew not whence they were;
\[5]and it came to pass when the gate had to be closed, at dark, that the men went out: I know not whither the men have gone. Pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.
\[6]But she had taken them up to the roof, and secreted them under the stalks of flax, which she had laid out on the roof.
\[7]And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan, to the fords; and when they who pursued after them had gone out, they closed the gate.
\[8]And before they had lain down, she went up to them upon the roof;
\[9]and said to the men, I know that Jehovah has given you the land, and that the dread of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.
\[10]For we have heard that Jehovah dried up the waters of the Red sea before you when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
\[11]We heard [of it], and our heart melted, and there remained no more spirit in any man because of you; for Jehovah your God, he is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath.
\[12]And now, I pray you, swear to me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye will also deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a certain sign,
\[13]that ye will let my father live, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that belong to them, and deliver our souls from death.
\[14]And the men said to her, Our lives shall pay for yours, if ye do not make this our business known; and it shall be when Jehovah shall give us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.
\[15]And she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was upon the city-wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
\[16]And she said to them, Go to the mountain, that the pursuers may not meet with you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned; and afterwards go your way.
\[17]And the men said to her, We will be quit of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.
\[18]Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind in the window this line of scarlet thread by which thou hast let us down; and thou shalt gather to thee in the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household;
\[19]and it shall be, that whoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street,—his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be innocent; but every one who shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be upon our head, if any hand be upon him.
\[20]And if thou make known this our business, we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us swear.
\[21]And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed. And she bound the scarlet line in the window.
\[22]And they went, and came to the mountain, and remained there three days, until the pursuers had returned; and the pursuers sought them all the way, and found them not.
\[23]And the two men returned and came down from the mountain, and went over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and related to him everything that had happened to them.
\[24]And they said to Joshua, Of a surety Jehovah has given the whole land into our hands, and even all the inhabitants of the land faint because of us.

\[2]And it came to pass at the end of three days, that the officers went through the camp;
\[3]and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then remove from your place, and go after it;
\[4]yet there shall be a distance between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Ye shall not come near it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore.
\[5]And Joshua said to the people, Hallow yourselves; for to-morrow Jehovah will do wonders in your midst.
\[6]And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and go over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
\[7]And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee.
\[8]And thou shalt command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, stand still in the Jordan.
\[9]And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of Jehovah your God.
\[10]And Joshua said, Hereby shall ye know that the living God is in your midst, and [that] he will without fail dispossess from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.
\[11]Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is going over before you into the Jordan.
\[12]And now take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe.
\[13]And it shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan, the waters flowing down from above, shall be cut off, and shall stand up in a heap.
\[14]And it came to pass when the people removed from their tents, to pass over the Jordan, that the priests bearing the ark of the covenant were before the people;
\[15]and when they that bore the ark were come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped in the edge of the water (and the Jordan is full over all its banks throughout the days of harvest),
\[16]the waters which flowed down from above stood [and] rose up in a heap, very far, by Adam, the city that is beside Zaretan; and those that flowed down towards the sea of the plain, the salt sea, were completely cut off. And the people went over opposite to Jericho.
\[17]And the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan. And all Israel went over on dry ground, until all the nation had completely gone over the Jordan.

\[3]and command them, saying, Take up hence out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging-place where ye shall lodge this night.
\[4]And Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had appointed of the children of Israel, a man out of every tribe;
\[5]and Joshua said to them, Pass before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and lift up each of you a stone [and put it] upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel,
\[6]that this may be a sign in your midst. When your children ask hereafter, saying, What mean ye by these stones?
\[7]then ye shall say to them, That the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it went through the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.
\[8]And the children of Israel did so, as Joshua had commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah had spoken to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them to the lodging-place, and laid them down there.
\[9]And twelve stones did Joshua set up in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant had stood firm; and they are there to this day.
\[10]And the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished that Jehovah had commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. And the people hasted and passed over.
\[11]And it came to pass, when all the people had completely gone over, that the ark of Jehovah went over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.
\[12]And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, went over in array before the children of Israel, as Moses had spoken to them.
\[13]About forty thousand armed for military service passed over before Jehovah to the war, unto the plains of Jericho.
\[14]On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life.
\[15]And Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying,
\[16]Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.

\[19]And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the eastern extremity of Jericho.
\[20]And those twelve stones which they had taken out of the Jordan did Joshua set up in Gilgal.
\[21]And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your children hereafter ask their fathers, saying, What [mean] these stones?
\[22]then ye shall let your children know, saying, On dry land did Israel come over this Jordan;
\[23]because Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until ye had passed over, as Jehovah your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had passed over;

\[2]At that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make thee stone-knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.
\[3]And Joshua made him stone-knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of Araloth.
\[4]And this is the cause why Joshua circumcised [them]: all the people that had come out of Egypt, the males, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way, after they came out of Egypt.
\[5]For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness on the way, after they came out of Egypt, [them] had they not circumcised.
\[6]For the children of Israel had walked forty years in the wilderness, till the whole nation of men of war had perished who had come out of Egypt, who had not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah; to whom Jehovah had sworn that he would not show them the land which Jehovah had sworn unto their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
\[7]And their sons [whom] he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.
\[8]And it came to pass when the whole nation had finished being circumcised, that they abode in their place in the camp, till they were whole.
\[9]And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. And the name of the place was called Gilgal to this day.
\[10]And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and held the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the plains of Jericho.
\[11]And they ate of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened loaves, and roasted [corn] on that same day.
\[12]And the manna ceased on the morrow, when they had eaten of the old corn of the land; and there was no more manna for the children of Israel; and they ate of the produce of the land of Canaan that year.
\[13]And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there stood a man before him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went to him, and said to him: Art thou for us, or for our enemies?
\[14]And he said, No; for [as] captain of the army of Jehovah am I now come. Then Joshua fell upon his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said to him, What saith my lord unto his servant?

\[3]And ye shall go round the city, all the men of war, encompassing the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.
\[4]And seven priests shall carry before the ark seven blast-trumpets; and on the seventh day ye shall go round the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.
\[5]And it shall come to pass when they make a long blast with the blast-horn, that all the people on hearing the sound of the trumpet shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall flat, and the people shall go up, each one straight before him.
\[6]And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Carry the ark of the covenant, and seven priests shall carry seven blast-trumpets before the ark of Jehovah.
\[7]And he said to the people, Pass on, go round the city, and they that are armed shall pass on before the ark of Jehovah.
\[8]And it came to pass when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests carrying the seven blast-trumpets before Jehovah passed on and blew with the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went after them.
\[9]And the armed men went before the priests who blew with the trumpets, and the rearguard came after the ark; they blew with the trumpets in marching.
\[10]And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, Shout; then shall ye shout.
\[11]And the ark of Jehovah went round the city, encompassing [it] once; and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.

\[13]And the seven priests carrying the seven blast-trumpets before the ark of Jehovah went on and blew continually with the trumpets; and the armed men went before them, and the rearguard went after the ark of Jehovah; they blew with the trumpets in marching.
\[14]And on the second day they went round the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.
\[15]And it was so that on the seventh day they rose early, about the morning-dawn, and went round the city after the same manner seven times; only on that day they went round the city seven times.
\[16]And it came to pass the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, that Joshua said to the people, Shout; for Jehovah has given you the city.
\[17]And the city shall be accursed, it and all that is in it, to Jehovah; only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
\[18]But in any wise keep from the accursed thing, lest ye make [yourselves] accursed in taking of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.
\[19]And all the silver, and gold, and vessels of copper and iron, shall be holy to Jehovah; they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.
\[20]And the people shouted, and they blew with the trumpets. And it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpets, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat; and the people went up into the city, each one straight before him, and they took the city.
\[21]And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city; both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.
\[22]And Joshua said to the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house and bring out thence the woman, and all that she has, as ye swore unto her.
\[23]And the young men, the spies, went in and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had: all her kindred did they bring out, and they left them outside the camp of Israel.
\[24]And they burned the city with fire, and all that was therein; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of copper and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.
\[25]And Joshua saved alive Rahab the harlot, and her father's household, and all that she had, and she dwelt in the midst of Israel to this day; because she hid the messengers whom Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho.
\[26]And Joshua swore at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah who shall rise up and build this city Jericho! In his first-born shall he lay its foundation, and in his youngest son shall he set up its gates.

\[2]And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and spy out the country. And the men went up and spied out Ai.
\[3]And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up; let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; make not all the people to toil thither, for they are few.
\[4]And there went up thither of the people about three thousand men, but they fled before the men of Ai.
\[5]And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty-six men; and they pursued them from before the gate to Shebarim, and smote them on the descent. Then the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.
\[6]And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and threw dust upon their heads.
\[7]And Joshua said, Alas, Lord Jehovah, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Oh that we had been content and had remained beyond the Jordan!
\[8]Ah Lord! what shall I say after Israel have turned their backs before their enemies?
\[9]When the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear [of it], they will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. And what wilt thou do unto thy great name?
\[10]And Jehovah said to Joshua, Rise up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?
\[11]Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them, and they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it among their stuff.
\[12]And the children of Israel shall not be able to stand before their enemies: they shall turn their backs before their enemies, for they have made themselves accursed. I will no more be with you, except ye destroy the accursed thing from your midst.
\[13]Rise up, hallow the people, and say, Hallow yourselves for to-morrow; for thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, Israel: thou shalt not be able to stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from your midst.
\[14]And ye shall be brought near in the morning according to your tribes; and it shall be, that the tribe which Jehovah taketh shall come forward by families, and the family which Jehovah taketh shall come forward by households; and the household which Jehovah taketh shall come forward man by man.
\[15]And it shall be, that he who is taken with the accursed thing shall be burned with fire, he and all that he hath, because he hath transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because he hath wrought wickedness in Israel.
\[16]And Joshua rose early in the morning, and caused Israel to come forward by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken.
\[17]And he caused the families of Judah to come forward, and he took the family of the Zarhites. And he caused the family of the Zarhites to come forward man by man, and Zabdi was taken.
\[18]And he caused his household to come forward man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
\[19]And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to Jehovah the God of Israel, and make confession to him: tell me now what thou hast done, keep it not back from me.
\[20]And Achan answered Joshua and said, Indeed I have sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done.
\[21]I saw among the spoils a beautiful mantle of Shinar, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a golden bar of fifty shekels weight, and I coveted them and took them; and behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
\[22]And Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
\[23]And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before Jehovah.
\[24]Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the bar of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up into the valley of Achor.
\[25]And Joshua said, How hast thou troubled us! Jehovah will trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.
\[26]And they raised over him a great heap of stones, [which is there] to this day. And Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called, The Valley of Achor, to this day.

nd Jehovah said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be dismayed. Take with thee all the people of war, and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land.
\[2]And thou shalt do to Ai and to its king as thou didst to Jericho and to its king; only, the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall ye take as prey for yourselves. Set an ambush against the city behind it.
\[3]And Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai. And Joshua chose thirty thousand valiant men, and sent them away by night.
\[4]And he commanded them, saying, See, ye shall be in ambush against the city, behind the city: go not very far from the city, and be all of you ready.
\[5]And I and all the people that are with me will approach to the city; and it shall come to pass when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them.
\[6]And they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first; and we will flee before them.
\[7]And ye shall rise up from the ambush and take possession of the city; and Jehovah your God will deliver it into your hand.
\[8]And it shall be when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire; according to the word of Jehovah shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.
\[9]And Joshua sent them forth; and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west of Ai. And Joshua lodged that night among the people.
\[10]And Joshua rose early in the morning, and inspected the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
\[11]And all the people of war that were with him went up, and drew near, and came before the city; and they encamped on the north of Ai; and the valley was between them and Ai.
\[12]Now he had taken about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west of the city.
\[13]And when they had set the people, the whole camp on the north of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
\[14]And it came to pass when the king of Ai saw it, that the men of the city hasted and rose early, and went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the appointed place before the plain. But he knew not that there was an ambush against him behind the city.
\[15]And Joshua and all Israel let themselves be beaten before them; and they fled by the way of the wilderness.
\[16]And all the people that were in the city were called together to pursue after them; and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
\[17]And not a man remained in Ai and Bethel that went not out after Israel; and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.
\[18]And Jehovah said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that he had in his hand toward the city.
\[19]And the ambush arose quickly from their place, and they ran when he stretched out his hand, and came into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.
\[20]And the men of Ai turned and saw, and behold, the smoke of the city went up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way; and the people that fled to the wilderness turned upon the pursuers.
\[21]When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city went up, they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.
\[22]And the others went out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side; and they smote them, until they let none of them escape or flee away.
\[23]And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
\[24]And it came to pass when Israel had ended slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they had chased them, and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
\[25]And so it was, that all who fell that day, men as well as women, were twelve thousand, all the people of Ai.
\[26]And Joshua did not draw back his hand, which he had stretched out with the javelin, until they had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
\[27]Only, the cattle and the spoil of the city Israel took as prey to themselves, according to the word of Jehovah which he had commanded Joshua.
\[28]And Joshua burned Ai, and made it an everlasting heap of desolation to this day.
\[29]And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the evening; and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his carcase down from the tree, and threw it down at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised upon it a great heap of stones, [which remains] to this day.
\[30]Then Joshua built an altar to Jehovah the God of Israel, in mount Ebal,
\[31]as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which iron had not been lifted up. And they offered up burnt-offerings on it to Jehovah, and sacrificed peace-offerings.
\[32]And he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written before the children of Israel.
\[33]And all Israel, and their elders, and their officers and judges, stood on this side and on that side of the ark before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, as well the stranger as the home-born [Israelite]; half of them toward mount Gerizim, and the other half of them toward mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded, that they should bless the people of Israel, in the beginning.
\[34]And afterwards he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
\[35]There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua read not before the whole congregation of Israel, and the women, and the children, and the strangers that lived among them.

\[2]that they assembled together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
\[3]And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
\[4]then they also acted with craft, and they went prepared as on a journey, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine-flasks, old and rent and tied up;
\[5]and old and patched sandals upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry [and] mouldy.
\[6]And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, From a far country are we come; and now make a covenant with us.
\[7]And the men of Israel said to the Hivite, Perhaps thou dwellest in the midst of us, and how should I make a covenant with thee?
\[8]And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said to them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?
\[9]And they said to him, From a very far country are thy servants come, because of the name of Jehovah thy God; for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
\[10]and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon the king of Heshbon, and to Og the king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.
\[11]And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take victuals in your hand for the way, and go to meet them, and say to them, We are your servants, and now make a covenant with us.
\[12]This our bread we took warm for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; and now, behold, it is dry, and is become mouldy.
\[13]And these flasks of wine which we filled new, behold, they are rent; and these our garments and our sandals are become old by reason of the very long journey.
\[14]And the men took of their victuals, but they did not inquire at the mouth of Jehovah.
\[15]And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live; and the princes of the assembly swore unto them.
\[16]And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt in their midst.
\[17]And the children of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day; and their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.
\[18]And the children of Israel did not smite them, because the princes of the assembly had sworn unto them by Jehovah the God of Israel. Then all the assembly murmured against the princes.
\[19]And all the princes said to all the assembly, We have sworn unto them by Jehovah the God of Israel, and now we may not touch them.
\[20]This we will do to them, and let them live, lest wrath come upon us, because of the oath which we swore unto them.
\[21]And the princes said to them, Let them live. And they were hewers of wood and drawers of water for all the assembly; as the princes had said to them.
\[22]And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have ye deceived us, saying, We are very far from you; whereas ye dwell in our midst?
\[23]And now ye are cursed, and ye shall never cease to be bondmen, and hewers of wood, and drawers of water for the house of my God.
\[24]And they answered Joshua and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants how that Jehovah thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; and we feared greatly for our lives because of you, and did this thing.
\[25]And now behold, we are in thy hand: as it is good and right in thine eyes to do to us, do.
\[26]And he did so to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, and they did not slay them.
\[27]And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the assembly, and for the altar of Jehovah, to this day, in the place which he should choose.

\[2]that they feared greatly; for Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.
\[3]And Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piream king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
\[4]Come up to me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
\[5]And the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, [and] the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their armies, and they encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.
\[6]And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua, to the camp at Gilgal, saying, Withdraw not thy hand from thy servants: come up to us quickly, and save us and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered against us.
\[7]So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, even all the valiant men.
\[8]And Jehovah said to Joshua, Fear them not; for into thy hand have I given them: not a man of them shall stand before thee.
\[9]And Joshua came upon them suddenly; he went up from Gilgal all night.
\[10]And Jehovah discomfited them before Israel, and smote them [with] a great slaughter at Gibeon; and he chased them on the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them up to Azekah and Makkedah.
\[11]And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel,—they were at the descent of Beth-horon,—that Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them up to Azekah, and they died. They were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel had slain with the sword.
\[12]Then spoke Joshua to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah gave up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand still upon Gibeon; And thou, moon, in the valley of Ajalon!
\[13]And the sun stood still, and the moon remained where it was, until the nation had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? And the sun remained standing in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a full day.
\[14]And there was no day like that before it or after it, that Jehovah hearkened to the voice of a man; for Jehovah fought for Israel.
\[15]And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp, to Gilgal.
\[16]And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
\[17]And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings have been found, hid in the cave at Makkedah.
\[18]And Joshua said, Roll great stones before the mouth of the cave, and set men before it to keep them.
\[19]And ye, stay not, pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities; for Jehovah your God has given them into your hand.
\[20]And it came to pass when Joshua and the children of Israel had ended smiting them with a very great slaughter, until they were consumed, that the remnant which remained of them entered into fortified cities;
\[21]and all the people returned to the camp to Joshua, at Makkedah, in peace; none moved his tongue against the children of Israel.
\[22]And Joshua said, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth to me those five kings out of the cave.
\[23]And they did so, and brought forth to him those five kings out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.
\[24]And it came to pass when they had brought forth those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called to all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him, Come forward, put your feet on the necks of these kings. And they came forward and put their feet on their necks.
\[25]And Joshua said to them, Fear not, neither be dismayed; be strong and courageous, for thus will Jehovah do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.
\[26]And afterwards Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees; and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
\[27]And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave where they had been hid, and laid great stones before the cave's mouth, [which remain] to this very day.
\[28]And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, him and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed; he let none remain; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
\[29]And Joshua passed, and all Israel with him, from Makkedah to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.
\[30]And Jehovah gave it also and the king thereof into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it: and he did to the king thereof as he had done to the king of Jericho.
\[31]And Joshua passed, and all Israel with him, from Libnah to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it.
\[32]And Jehovah gave Lachish into the hand of Israel; and they took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
\[33]Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
\[34]And Joshua, and all Israel with him, passed from Lachish to Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it.
\[35]And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed on that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
\[36]And Joshua went up, and all Israel with him, from Eglon to Hebron; and they fought against it.
\[37]And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein: he let none remain, according to all that he had done to Eglon; and he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls that were therein.
\[38]And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it.
\[39]And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: as he had done to Hebron, and as he had done to Libnah, and to the king thereof, so he did to Debir and to the king thereof.
\[40]And Joshua smote the whole country, the mountain, and the south, and the lowland, and the hill-slopes, and all their kings: he let none remain, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah the God of Israel had commanded.
\[41]And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even to Gazah, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon;
\[42]and all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time; for Jehovah the God of Israel fought for Israel.

\[4]And they went out, they and all their armies with them, a people numerous as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.
\[5]And all these kings met together, and came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
\[6]And Jehovah said to Joshua, Be not afraid because of them; for to-morrow about this time will I give them all up slain before Israel: their horses shalt thou hough, and thou shalt burn their chariots with fire.
\[7]And Joshua, and all the people of war with him, came upon them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them.
\[8]And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and to Misrephoth-maim, and to the valley of Mizpah eastward, and smote them until none were left remaining to them.
\[9]And Joshua did to them as Jehovah had said to him: he houghed their horses, and burned their chariots with fire.
\[10]And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword; for Hazor was in times past the head of all those kingdoms.
\[11]And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, destroying them utterly: there was not any left to breathe; and he burned Hazor with fire.
\[12]And all the cities of those kings and all their kings did Joshua take; and he smote them with the edge of the sword, destroying them utterly, as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded.
\[13]Only, all the cities that stood still upon their hills Israel did not burn, save Hazor alone, [which] Joshua burned.
\[14]And all the spoil of these cities and the cattle the children of Israel took as prey to themselves; only, they smote all the men with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them: they left none that breathed.
\[15]As Jehovah had commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua: he let nothing fail of all that Jehovah had commanded Moses.
\[16]And Joshua took all that land, the mountain and all the south, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and its lowland;
\[17]from the smooth mountain, which rises toward Seir, as far as Baal-Gad in the valley of Lebanon, at the foot of mount Hermon; and he took all their kings, and smote them, and put them to death.
\[18]Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
\[19]There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites who dwelt at Gibeon; they took all in battle.
\[20]For it was of Jehovah that their heart was hardened, to meet Israel in battle, that they might be utterly destroyed, and that there might be no favour shewn to them, but that they might be destroyed, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
\[21]And Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountain of Judah, and from all the mountain of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly, with their cities.
\[22]There were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel; only at Gazah, at Gath, and at Ashdod there remained.

\[7]And now divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes, and to half the tribe of Manasseh;

\[12]all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, who remained of the residue of the giants; and Moses smote them and dispossessed them.
\[13]But the children of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurites nor the Maachathites; but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites to this day.
\[14]Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance: the offerings by fire of Jehovah the God of Israel are their inheritance, as he said to them.

\[30]their territory was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, the whole kingdom of Og the king of Bashan, and all the villages of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities.

nd this is what the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, allotted for inheritance to them:
\[2]their inheritance was by lot, as Jehovah had commanded by Moses, for the nine tribes, and the half tribe.
\[3]For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half tribe beyond the Jordan, but to the Levites he had given no inheritance among them.
\[4]For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim; and they gave no part to the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, and their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.
\[5]As Jehovah had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.
\[6]Then the children of Judah came near to Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, Thou knowest the word that Jehovah spoke to Moses the man of God, concerning me and thee, in Kadesh-barnea.
\[7]Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh-barnea to search out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart.
\[8]And my brethren that had gone up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Jehovah my God.
\[9]And Moses swore on that day, saying, The land whereon thy feet have trodden shall assuredly be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever! for thou hast wholly followed Jehovah my God.
\[10]And now behold, Jehovah has kept me alive, as he said, these forty-five years, since Jehovah spoke this word to Moses, when Israel wandered in the wilderness; and now behold, I am this day eighty-five years old.
\[11]I am still this day strong, as in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out and to come in.
\[12]And now give me this mountain, of which Jehovah spoke in that day; for thou heardest in that day that Anakim are there, and great fortified cities. If so be Jehovah shall be with me, then I shall dispossess them, as Jehovah said.
\[13]And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
\[14]Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly followed Jehovah the God of Israel.
\[15]Now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-Arba; the great man among the Anakim. And the land rested from war.

\[13]And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah according to the commandment of Jehovah to Joshua, the city of Arba, the father of Anak, that is, Hebron.
\[14]And thence Caleb dispossessed the three sons of Anak, Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, who were born of Anak.
\[15]And from there he went up against the inhabitants of Debir; now the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher.
\[16]And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjath-sepher and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.
\[17]And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
\[18]And it came to pass as she came, that she urged him to ask of her father a field; and she sprang down from the ass. And Caleb said to her, What wouldest thou?
\[19]And she said, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a southern land; give me also springs of water. Then he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.

\[4]And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. And he gave them according to the commandment of Jehovah an inheritance among the brethren of their father.
\[5]And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which are beyond the Jordan.
\[6]For the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons; and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.
\[7]And the territory of Manasseh was from Asher to Micmethath, which is before Shechem, and the border went on the right hand toward the inhabitants of En-Tappuah.
\[8]Manasseh had the land of Tappuah; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.

\[13]And it came to pass when the children of Israel were become strong, that they made the Canaanites tributary; but they did not utterly dispossess them.
\[14]And the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me as inheritance one lot and one portion, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as Jehovah has blessed me hitherto?
\[15]And Joshua said unto them, If thou art a great people, then get thee up to the wood, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee.
\[16]And the children of Joseph said, The hill-country will not be enough for us; and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, those that are of Beth-shean and its dependent villages, and those that are in the valley of Jizreel.
\[17]And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only,

\[4]Provide you three men for a tribe; that I may send them, and they shall rise and go through the land, and describe it according to the proportion of their inheritance, and they shall come to me.

\[12]But the fields of the city and the hamlets thereof gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
\[13]And they gave to the children of Aaron the priest the city of refuge for the slayer, Hebron and its suburbs; and Libnah and its suburbs,
\[14]and Jattir and its suburbs, and Eshtemoa and its suburbs,
\[15]and Holon and its suburbs, and Debir and its suburbs,
\[16]and Ain and its suburbs, and Juttah and its suburbs, [and] Beth-shemesh and its suburbs: nine cities out of those two tribes;
\[17]and out of the tribe of Benjamin: Gibeon and its suburbs, Geba and its suburbs,
\[18]Anathoth and its suburbs, and Almon and its suburbs; four cities.
\[19]All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities and their suburbs.
\[20]And to the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites that remained of the children of Kohath, [they gave cities]. And the cities of their lot were out of the tribe of Ephraim,
\[21]and they gave them the city of refuge for the slayer, Shechem and its suburbs in mount Ephraim; and Gezer and its suburbs,
\[22]and Kibzaim and its suburbs, and Beth-horon and its suburbs: four cities;
\[23]and out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh and its suburbs, Gibbethon and its suburbs,
\[24]Ajalon and its suburbs, Gath-Rimmon and its suburbs: four cities;
\[25]and out of half the tribe of Manasseh, Taanach and its suburbs and Gath-Rimmon and its suburbs: two cities.
\[26]All the cities were ten and their suburbs, for the families of the children of Kohath that remained.
\[27]And to the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of half the tribe of Manasseh, [they gave] the city of refuge for the slayer, Golan in Bashan and its suburbs; and Beeshterah and its suburbs: two cities;
\[28]and out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion and its suburbs, Dabrath and its suburbs,
\[29]Jarmuth and its suburbs, En-gannim and its suburbs: four cities;

\[32]and out of the tribe of Naphtali, the city of refuge for the slayer, Kedesh in Galilee, and its suburbs; and Hammoth-Dor and its suburbs, and Kartan and its suburbs: three cities.
\[33]All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities and their suburbs.
\[34]And to the families of the children of Merari, that remained of the Levites, [they gave] out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam and its suburbs, Kartah and its suburbs,
\[35]Dimnah and its suburbs, Nahalal and its suburbs: four cities;
\[36]and out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer and its suburbs, and Jahzah and its suburbs,

\[38]and out of the tribe of Gad, the city of refuge for the slayer, Ramoth in Gilead and its suburbs; and Mahanaim and its suburbs,
\[39]Heshbon and its suburbs, Jaazer and its suburbs: four cities in all.
\[40][These were] all the cities of the children of Merari according to their families, which remained of the families of the Levites, and their lot was twelve cities.
\[41]All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty-eight cities and their suburbs.
\[42]Each one of these cities had its suburbs round about it: thus were all these cities.
\[43]And Jehovah gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give unto their fathers; and they took possession of it, and dwelt in it.
\[44]And Jehovah gave them rest round about, according to all that he had sworn unto their fathers; and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them: Jehovah gave all their enemies into their hand.
\[45]There failed nothing of all the good things that Jehovah had spoken to the house of Israel: all came to pass.

hen Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
\[2]and said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, and have hearkened to my voice in all that I commanded you.
\[3]Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, and ye have kept the charge of the commandment of Jehovah your God.
\[4]And now Jehovah your God hath given rest to your brethren, as he said unto them; and now return, and get you unto your tents, unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan.
\[5]Only, take great heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, to love Jehovah your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.
\[6]And Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went to their tents.
\[7]And to half the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given [inheritance] in Bashan, and to the other half thereof had Joshua given among their brethren on this side the Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them also,
\[8]and spoke to them, saying, Return unto your tents with much wealth and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with copper, and with iron, and with clothing, in very great quantity; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.
\[9]And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the country of Gilead, into the land of their possession, of which they had become possessed, according to the word of Jehovah through Moses.
\[10]And they came to the districts of the Jordan that are in the land of Canaan; and the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, an altar of grand appearance.
\[11]And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the districts of the Jordan, separately from the children of Israel.
\[12]And when the children of Israel heard [of it], the whole assembly of the children of Israel gathered together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.
\[13]And the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
\[14]and with him ten princes, of each father's house a prince, out of all the tribes of Israel; and each of them was head of a father's house, of the thousands of Israel.
\[15]And they came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and spoke with them, saying,
\[16]Thus saith the whole assembly of Jehovah: What wickedness is this which ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following Jehovah, in that ye have built yourselves an altar, rebelling this day against Jehovah?
\[17]Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us? from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the assembly of Jehovah.
\[18]And ye turn away this day from following Jehovah; and it will be, that since ye rebel this day against Jehovah, to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole assembly of Israel.
\[19]Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession is unclean, come over into the land of the possession of Jehovah, where Jehovah's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession amongst us; but rebel not against Jehovah, and rebel not against us, in building for yourselves an altar besides the altar of Jehovah our God.
\[20]Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing? and wrath fell on all the assembly of Israel, and he perished not alone in his iniquity.
\[21]And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered and said to the heads of the thousands of Israel,
\[22]The God of gods, Jehovah, the God of gods, Jehovah, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know [it]; if it is in rebellion, or if in trespass against Jehovah,—save us not this day!
\[23]—that we have built for ourselves an altar to turn from following Jehovah, and if it is to offer up burnt-offering and oblation on it, and if to offer peace-offerings thereon, let Jehovah himself require it [from us];
\[24]and if we have not done it from fear of this thing, saying, In future your children will speak to our children, saying, What have ye to do with Jehovah the God of Israel?
\[25]Jehovah hath made the Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad, ye have no portion in Jehovah! And so shall your children make our children cease from fearing Jehovah.
\[26]And we said, Let us now set to work to build an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice,
\[27]but to be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we might do service to Jehovah before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to our children in future, Ye have no portion in Jehovah.
\[28]And we said, If it shall be that in future they so say to us and to our generations, we will say, Behold the pattern of the altar of Jehovah which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice, but as a witness between us and you.
\[29]Far be it from us that we should rebel against Jehovah, and turn this day from following Jehovah, in building an altar for burnt-offering, for oblation, and for sacrifice, besides the altar of Jehovah our God that is before his tabernacle.
\[30]And when Phinehas the priest and the princes of the assembly and the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it was good in their sight.
\[31]And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that Jehovah is among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against Jehovah: now have ye delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah.
\[32]And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
\[33]And the thing was good in the sight of the children of Israel, and the children of Israel blessed God, and no more said that they would go up in warfare against them, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and the children of Gad dwelt.
\[34]And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad gave a name to the altar; for it is a witness between us that Jehovah is God.

nd it came to pass a long time after that Jehovah had given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua had become old, advanced in age,
\[2]that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am become old, advanced in age;
\[3]and ye have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done to all these nations because of you. For Jehovah your God is he that hath fought for you.
\[4]Behold, I have divided unto you by lot for an inheritance, according to your tribes, these nations that remain, from the Jordan, as well as all the nations that I have cut off, as far as the great sea toward the sun-setting.
\[5]And Jehovah your God, he will expel them from before you, and dispossess them from out of your sight; and ye shall take possession of their land, as Jehovah your God hath said unto you.
\[6]And be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;
\[7]that ye enter not among these nations, these that remain among you; and ye shall make no mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear [by them], neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them;
\[8]but ye shall cleave unto Jehovah your God, as ye have done unto this day.
\[9]For Jehovah hath dispossessed from before you great and strong nations; and as to you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day.
\[10]One man of you chaseth a thousand; for Jehovah your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath said unto you.
\[11]Take great heed therefore unto your souls, that ye love Jehovah your God.
\[12]For if ye in any wise go back, and cleave unto the residue of these nations, these that remain among you, and make marriages with them, and come in unto them and they unto you:
\[13]know for a certainty that Jehovah your God will no more dispossess these nations from before you, and they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which Jehovah your God hath given you.
\[14]And behold, I am going this day the way of all the earth; and ye know in all your heart, and in all your soul, that not one thing hath failed of all the good words that Jehovah your God hath spoken concerning you: all are come to pass unto you—not one thing hath failed thereof.
\[15]But it shall come to pass, that as every good word hath been fulfilled to you, that Jehovah your God spoke to you, so will Jehovah bring upon you every evil word, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which Jehovah your God hath given you;
\[16]when ye transgress the covenant of Jehovah your God which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow yourselves unto them, so that the anger of Jehovah shall be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.

nd Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
\[2]And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: Your fathers dwelt of old on the other side of the river, Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, and they served other gods.
\[3]And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the river, and led him throughout the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed and gave him Isaac.
\[4]And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau; and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; and Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt.
\[5]And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them; and afterwards I brought you out.
\[6]And I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.
\[7]Then they cried to Jehovah, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt; and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long time.
\[8]And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt beyond the Jordan, and they fought with you, and I gave them into your hand, and ye took possession of their land, and I destroyed them from before you.
\[9]And Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you;
\[10]but I would not hearken unto Balaam, and he blessed you expressly, and I delivered you out of his hand.
\[11]And ye went over the Jordan, and came unto Jericho, and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.
\[12]And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, [as] the two kings of the Amorites; not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.
\[13]And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.
\[14]And now fear Jehovah and serve him in perfectness and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the river, and in Egypt; and serve Jehovah.
\[15]And if it seem evil unto you to serve Jehovah, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods whom your fathers that were on the other side of the river served, or the gods of the Amorite, in whose land ye dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah.
\[16]And the people answered and said, Far be it from us that we should forsake Jehovah, to serve other gods;
\[17]for Jehovah our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did those great signs before our eyes, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed!
\[18]And Jehovah drove out from before us all the peoples, and the Amorites the inhabitants of the land: so therefore we will serve Jehovah, for he is our God.
\[19]And Joshua said to the people, Ye cannot serve Jehovah, for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.
\[20]If ye forsake Jehovah, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.
\[21]And the people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve Jehovah.
\[22]And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you Jehovah, to serve him. And they said, [We are] witnesses.
\[23]Now therefore put away the strange gods that are among you, and incline your heart unto Jehovah the God of Israel.
\[24]And the people said unto Joshua, Jehovah our God will we serve, and to his voice will we hearken.
\[25]So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
\[26]And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah.
\[27]And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us, for it hath heard all the words of Jehovah which he spoke unto us; and it shall be a witness against you, lest ye deny your God.
\[28]And Joshua dismissed the people, every man to his inheritance.
\[29]And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, a hundred and ten years old.
\[30]And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the mountain of Gaash.
\[31]And Israel served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders whose days were prolonged after Joshua, and who had known all the works of Jehovah, which he had done for Israel.
\[32]And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem in the portion of the field which Jacob had bought of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred kesitahs; and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
\[33]And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which had been given him in mount Ephraim.

nd it came to pass after the death of Joshua that the children of Israel asked Jehovah, saying, Which of us shall go up against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
\[2]And Jehovah said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
\[3]And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, and let us fight against the Canaanites, and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot; and Simeon went with him.
\[4]And Judah went up; and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they smote them in Bezek, ten thousand men.
\[5]And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
\[6]And Adoni-Bezek fled, and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
\[7]And Adoni-Bezek said, Seventy kings, with their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gleaned under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.
\[8]And the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
\[9]And afterwards the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the hill-country, and in the south, and in the lowland.
\[10]And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron—the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-Arba; and they slew Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.
\[11]And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir; now the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher.
\[12]And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjath-sepher and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.
\[13]And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
\[14]And it came to pass as she came, that she urged him to ask of her father the field; and she sprang down from the ass. And Caleb said to her, What wouldest thou?
\[15]And she said to him, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a southern land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
\[16]And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, had gone up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt with the people.
\[17]And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it; and they called the name of the city Hormah.
\[18]And Judah took Gazah and its border, and Ashkelon and its border, and Ekron and its border.
\[19]And Jehovah was with Judah; and he took possession of the hill-country, for he did not dispossess the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
\[20]And they gave to Caleb Hebron, as Moses had said; and he dispossessed from thence the three sons of Anak.
\[21]And the children of Benjamin did not dispossess the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
\[22]And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel; and Jehovah was with them.
\[23]And the house of Joseph sent to search out Bethel; now the name of the city before was Luz.
\[24]And the guards saw a man come forth out of the city, and said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, how [we] may enter into the city, and we will shew thee kindness.
\[25]And he shewed them how to enter into the city. And they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.
\[26]And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day.
\[27]And Manasseh did not dispossess Beth-shean and its dependent villages, nor Taanach and its dependent villages, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its dependent villages, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its dependent villages, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its dependent villages; and the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
\[28]And it came to pass when Israel became strong, that they made the Canaanites tributary; but they did not utterly dispossess them.
\[29]And Ephraim did not dispossess the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt among them in Gezer.
\[30]Zebulun did not dispossess the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.
\[31]Asher did not dispossess the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor Ahlab, nor Achzib, nor Helbah, nor Aphik, nor Rehob;
\[32]and the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not dispossess them.
\[33]Naphtali did not dispossess the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; and he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, but the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries to them.
\[34]And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill-country, for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley.
\[35]And the Amorites would dwell on mount Heres, in Ajalon and in Shaalbim; but the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, and they became tributaries.
\[36]And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upwards.

nd the Angel of Jehovah came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you; and as for you,
\[2]ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not hearkened unto my voice. Why have ye done this?
\[3]Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be [scourges] in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.
\[4]And it came to pass, when the Angel of Jehovah spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice and wept.
\[5]And they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there to Jehovah.
\[6]And Joshua dismissed the people, and the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.
\[7]And the people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders whose days were prolonged after Joshua, who had seen all the great works of Jehovah, which he had done for Israel.
\[8]And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, a hundred and ten years old.
\[9]And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-Heres, in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the mountain of Gaash.
\[10]And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers; and there arose another generation after them, which knew not Jehovah, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.
\[11]And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baals.
\[12]And they forsook Jehovah the God of their fathers, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked Jehovah to anger.
\[13]And they forsook Jehovah, and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.
\[14]And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about; and they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
\[15]Whithersoever they went out the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah had said, and as Jehovah had sworn unto them; and they were greatly distressed.
\[16]And Jehovah raised up judges, and they saved them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.
\[17]But they did not even hearken to their judges, for they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves to them; they turned quickly out of the way that their fathers had walked in, obeying the commandments of Jehovah; they did not so.
\[18]And when Jehovah raised them up judges, then Jehovah was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for it repented Jehovah because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and crushed them.
\[19]And it came to pass when the judge died, that they turned back and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them: they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.
\[20]And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel; and he said, Because this nation hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and hath not hearkened unto my voice,
\[21]I also will not henceforth dispossess from before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died;
\[22]that through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of Jehovah to walk therein, as their fathers did keep [it], or not.
\[23]Therefore Jehovah left those nations, without dispossessing them hastily, neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.

\[3]five lord ships of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwell on mount Lebanon; from mount Baal-Hermon unto the entering into Hamath.
\[4]And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would obey the commandments of Jehovah, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
\[5]And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites: Hittites and Amorites and Perizzites and Hivites and Jebusites;
\[6]and they took their daughters as wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
\[7]And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and forgot Jehovah their God, and served the Baals and the Asherahs.
\[8]And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.
\[9]And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah; and Jehovah raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
\[10]And the Spirit of Jehovah was upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Jehovah gave Chushan-rishathaim king of Syria into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.

\[13]And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek and went and smote Israel, and they took possession of the city of palm-trees.
\[14]And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
\[15]And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah, and Jehovah raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a man left-handed. And by him the children of Israel sent a gift to Eglon king of Moab.
\[16]And Ehud made him a sword having two edges, it was of a cubit length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right hip.
\[17]And he brought the gift to Eglon king of Moab; now Eglon was a very fat man.
\[18]And it came to pass when he had ended offering the gift, he sent away the people that had borne the gift.
\[19]But he turned from the graven images that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret word unto thee, O king. And he said, Be silent! And all that stood by him went out from him.
\[20]And Ehud came to him; now he was sitting in the cool upper-chamber, which was for him alone. And Ehud said, I have a word from God unto thee. And he arose from the seat.
\[21]Then Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right hip, and thrust it into his belly;
\[22]and the haft also went in after the blade, and the fat closed upon the blade; for he did not draw the sword out of his belly, and it came out between the legs.
\[23]And Ehud went out into the portico, and shut the doors of the upper-chamber upon him, and bolted them.
\[24]And when he was gone out, the servants of the [king] came and saw, and behold, the doors of the upper-chamber were bolted. And they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the summer chamber.
\[25]And they waited till they were ashamed; and behold, he opened not the doors of the upper-chamber, and they took the key, and opened [them], and behold, their lord lay dead on the earth.
\[26]And Ehud had escaped while they lingered, and passed beyond the graven images, and escaped to Seirah.
\[27]And it came to pass when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them.
\[28]And he said to them, Follow after me, for Jehovah has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan toward Moab, and suffered no one to pass over.
\[29]And they slew the Moabites at that time, about ten thousand men, all fat, and all men of valour, and not a man escaped.
\[30]And Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.
\[31]And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath; and he smote the Philistines, six hundred men, with an ox-goad. And he also delivered Israel.

nd the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of Jehovah; now Ehud was dead.
\[2]And Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; and the captain of his army was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth-Goim.
\[3]And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and he mightily oppressed the children of Israel twenty years.
\[4]And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, judged Israel at that time.
\[5]And she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
\[6]And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-Naphtali, and said to him, Hath not Jehovah the God of Israel commanded? Go and draw towards mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun,
\[7]and I will draw unto thee, to the torrent Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, and his chariots and his multitude, and I will give him into thy hand.
\[8]And Barak said to her, If thou goest with me, then I will go, but if thou goest not with me, I will not go.
\[9]And she said, I will by all means go with thee, only that it will not be to thine honour upon the way which thou goest, for Jehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
\[10]And Barak called together Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and there went up at his feet ten thousand men; and Deborah went up with him.
\[11](Now Heber the Kenite had severed himself from the Kenites, from the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak of Zaannaim, which is by Kedesh.)
\[12]And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to mount Tabor.
\[13]Then Sisera gathered together all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth-Goim to the torrent Kishon.
\[14]And Deborah said to Barak, Up; for this is the day in which Jehovah hath given Sisera into thy hand! Is not Jehovah gone out before thee? And Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
\[15]And Jehovah discomfited Sisera, and all the chariots, and all the army, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera got down from [his] chariot, and fled on foot.
\[16]And Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army, to Harosheth-Goim; and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not one was left.
\[17]And Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
\[18]And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And he turned in to her, into the tent, and she covered him with the quilt.
\[19]And he said to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty. And she opened the flask of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
\[20]And he said to her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be if any one come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.
\[21]And Jael Heber's wife took a tent-pin, and took the hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and smote the pin into his temples, and it penetrated into the ground; for he had fallen into a deep sleep and was faint; and he died.
\[22]And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael went out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And he went into her [tent], and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the pin was in his temples.
\[23]So God subdued on that day Jabin king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
\[24]And the hand of the children of Israel ever advanced, and prevailed against Jabin king of Canaan, until they had cut off Jabin king of Canaan.

\[2]For that leaders led in Israel, For that the people willingly offered themselves, Bless Jehovah!
\[3]Hear, ye kings; give ear, ye princes, I, [even] I, will sing to Jehovah; I will hymn to Jehovah the God of Israel.
\[4]Jehovah, when thou wentest forth from Seir, When thou marchedst out of the fields of Edom, The earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, Yea, the clouds dropped water.
\[5]The mountains quaked before the face of Jehovah, That Sinai, from before Jehovah the God of Israel.
\[6]In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, The roads were unused, and the travellers on highways went by crooked paths.
\[7]The villages ceased in Israel, Ceased until that I Deborah arose, That I arose a mother in Israel.
\[8]They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
\[9]My heart is toward the governors of Israel, who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless Jehovah!
\[10]Ye that ride on white she-asses, ye that sit on carpets, and ye that walk by the way, consider.
\[11]Because of the voice of those who divide [the spoil] in the midst of the places of drawing water; There they rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah, His righteous acts toward his villages in Israel. Then the people of Jehovah went down to the gates.
\[12]Awake, awake, Deborah! awake, awake, utter a song! Arise, Barak, and lead captive thy captives, thou son of Abinoam!
\[13]Then come down, thou, the remnant of nobles, [as his] people; Jehovah! come down with me in the midst of the mighty ones.
\[14]Out of Ephraim [came] those whose root was in Amalek; After thee was Benjamin among thy peoples. Out of Machir came down governors, And out of Zebulun they that handled the staff of the ruler.
\[15]And the princes in Issachar were with Deborah; And Issachar, like Barak; They were sent into the valley at his feet. In the divisions of Reuben there were great resolves of heart!
\[16]Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, To hear the bleating of the flocks? In the divisions of Reuben there were great deliberations of heart!
\[17]Gilead abode beyond Jordan; And Dan, why did he remain in ships? Asher sat on the sea-shore, And abode in his creeks.
\[18]Zebulun is a people [that] jeoparded their lives unto death, Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.
\[19]Kings came,—they fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan; At Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; They took no spoil of silver.
\[20]From heaven was the fight; The stars from their courses fought with Sisera.
\[21]The torrent of Kishon swept them away, That ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon. My soul, thou hast trodden down strength!
\[22]Then did the horse-hoofs clatter with the coursings, The coursings of their steeds.
\[23]Curse Meroz, saith the Angel of Jehovah; Curse, curse the inhabitants thereof; For they came not to the help of Jehovah, To the help of Jehovah among the mighty.
\[24]Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, Blessed above women in the tent!
\[25]He asked water, she gave milk; In the nobles' bowl she brought forth cream.
\[26]She put her hand to the tent-pin, And her right hand to the workmen's hammer; And she smote Sisera, she struck through his head, Shattered and pierced through his temples.
\[27]Between her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: Between her feet he bowed, he fell; Where he bowed, there he fell, overcome.
\[28]Them other of Sisera looketh out at the window, And crieth through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the trampings of his chariots?
\[29]The wise amongst her ladies answer [her], Yea, she returneth answer to herself,
\[30]Have they not found, divided the booty, A damsel, two damsels, to each? A booty of dyed stuffs for Sisera, A booty of dyed stuffs of embroidery, Dyed stuff of double embroidery for the neck of a spoiler?
\[31]So let all thine enemies perish, Jehovah! But let them that love him be as the rising of the sun in its might. And the land had rest forty years.

nd the children of Israel did evil in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
\[2]And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of the Midianites the children of Israel made for themselves the dens that are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
\[3]And it came to pass when Israel sowed, that Midian came up, and Amalek, and the children of the east, and came up against them.
\[4]And they encamped against them, and destroyed the produce of the land, until thou come to Gazah, and they left no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
\[5]For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as locusts for multitude; both they and their camels were without number; and they entered into the land to destroy it.
\[6]And Israel was greatly impoverished because of Midian. And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah.
\[7]And it came to pass when the children of Israel cried to Jehovah because of Midian,
\[8]that Jehovah sent a prophet to the children of Israel, who said to them, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;
\[9]and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land,
\[10]and I said to you, I am Jehovah your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell. But ye have not hearkened to my voice.
\[11]And an angel of Jehovah came and sat under the terebinth that was in Ophrah, that [belonged] to Joash the Abi-ezrite. And his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, to secure [it] from the Midianites.
\[12]And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him, and said to him, Jehovah is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.
\[13]And Gideon said to him, Ah my Lord, if Jehovah be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where are all his miracles that our fathers told us of, saying, Did not Jehovah bring us up from Egypt? And now Jehovah hath cast us off, and given us into the hand of Midian.
\[14]And Jehovah looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of Midian. Have not I sent thee?
\[15]And he said to him, Ah Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my thousand is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.
\[16]And Jehovah said to him, I will certainly be with thee; and thou shalt smite Midian as one man.
\[17]And he said to him, If now I have found favour in thine eyes, shew me a sign that it is thou who talkest with me.
\[18]Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.
\[19]And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid of the goats, and an ephah of flour in unleavened cakes: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the terebinth, and presented it.
\[20]And the Angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.
\[21]And the Angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And the Angel of Jehovah departed out of his sight.
\[22]And Gideon perceived that he was an angel of Jehovah; and Gideon said, Alas, Lord Jehovah! for because I have seen an angel of Jehovah face to face …
\[23]And Jehovah said to him, Peace be unto thee: fear not; thou shalt not die.
\[24]And Gideon built there an altar to Jehovah, and called it Jehovah-shalom. To this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.
\[25]And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said to him, Take the young bullock, which thy father hath, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the Asherah that is by it;
\[26]and build an altar to Jehovah thy God upon the top of this strong place in the ordered manner, and take the second bullock, and offer up a burnt-offering with the wood of the Asherah that thou shalt cut down.
\[27]And Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as Jehovah had said to him. And it came to pass, because he feared his father's house, and the men of the city, if he did it by day, that he did it by night.
\[28]And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered up upon the altar that was built.
\[29]And they said one to another, Who has done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.
\[30]And the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it.
\[31]And Joash said to all that stood near him, Will *ye* contend for Baal? or will *ye* save him? he that contends for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning. If he be a god, let him plead for himself, because they have broken down his altar.
\[32]And on that day they called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead with him, because he has broken down his altar.
\[33]And all Midian and Amalek and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.
\[34]And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Gideon, and he blew the trumpet, and the Abi-ezrites were gathered after him.
\[35]And he sent messengers throughout Manasseh, and they also were gathered after him; and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
\[36]And Gideon said to God, If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said,
\[37]behold, I put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor; if dew shall be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said.
\[38]And it was so. And when he rose up early on the morrow, he pressed the fleece together, and wrung dew out of the fleece, a bowl-full of water.
\[39]And Gideon said to God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once! Let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it, I pray thee, be dry upon the fleece only, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
\[40]And God did so that night, and it was dry upon the fleece only, but on all the ground there was dew.

nd Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, arose early, and all the people that were with him, and they encamped beside the spring Harod; and he had the camp of Midian on the north by the hill of Moreh in the valley.
\[2]And Jehovah said to Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give Midian into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.
\[3]And now proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is timid and afraid, let him go back and turn from mount Gilead. And there went back of the people twenty-two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
\[4]And Jehovah said to Gideon, Still the people are many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for thee there, and it shall be, that of whom I shall say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I shall say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
\[5]And he brought down the people to the water; and Jehovah said to Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down on his knees to drink.
\[6]And the number of them that lapped, with their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men; and all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.
\[7]And Jehovah said to Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and give Midian into thy hand; and let all the people go every man to his place.
\[8]And they took the victuals of the people in their hand, and their trumpets; and all the men of Israel he sent away, every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men. Now the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
\[9]And it came to pass in that night, that Jehovah said to him, Arise, go down to the camp; for I have given it into thy hand.
\[10]And if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the camp;
\[11]and thou shalt hear what they say; and afterwards shall thy hand be strengthened, and thou shalt go down unto the camp. And he went down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men that were in the camp.
\[12]And Midian and Amalek and all the children of the east lay along in the valley as locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand upon the sea-shore for multitude.
\[13]And Gideon came, and behold, a man was telling a dream to his fellow; and he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and lo, a cake of barley-bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it; and the tent lay along.
\[14]And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, the man of Israel: God hath given into his hand Midian and all the host.
\[15]And it came to pass when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, that he worshipped. And he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for Jehovah hath given into your hand the camp of Midian.
\[16]And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, and empty pitchers, and torches within the pitchers.
\[17]And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise; behold, when I come to the extremity of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.
\[18]And when I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, ye also shall blow the trumpets around the whole camp, and shall say, For Jehovah and for Gideon!
\[19]And Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came to the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch; and they blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.
\[20]And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hand, and the trumpets in their right hand for blowing, and cried, The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon!
\[21]And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran, and cried out, and fled.
\[22]And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and Jehovah set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout the camp. And the host fled to Beth-shittah towards Zererah, to the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.
\[23]And the men of Israel were called together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.
\[24]And Gideon sent messengers throughout mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters unto Beth-barah, and the Jordan. And all the men of Ephraim were called together, and took the waters unto Beth-barah, and the Jordan.
\[25]And they took two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb; and they pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.

nd the men of Ephraim said to him, What is this thing thou hast done to us, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with Midian? And they disputed with him sharply.
\[2]And he said to them, What have I done now in comparison with you? Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer?
\[3]Into your hands hath God delivered the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison with you? Then their spirit was appeased toward him, when he said that word.
\[4]And Gideon came to the Jordan, [and] passed over, he and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing.
\[5]And he said to the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread to the people that follow me, for they are faint; and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.
\[6]And the chief men of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in thy hand, that we should give bread to thine army?
\[7]And Gideon said, Therefore when Jehovah delivers Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will thresh your flesh with thorns of the wilderness and with briars.
\[8]And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke to them in like manner. And the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.
\[9]And he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.
\[10]Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their camp with them, about fifteen thousand [men], all that were left of the whole camp of the children of the east; for there had fallen a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.
\[11]And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwell in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the camp; for the camp was at its ease.
\[12]And Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued after them, and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the camp.
\[13]And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle, from the ascent of Heres.
\[14]And he caught a youth of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him; and he wrote down for him the chief men of Succoth, and the elders thereof, seventy-seven men.
\[15]And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy men that are weary?
\[16]And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briars, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
\[17]And he broke down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.
\[18]Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What sort of men were they that ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the sons of a king.
\[19]And he said, They were my brethren, the sons of my mother. [As] Jehovah liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.
\[20]And he said to Jether his firstborn, Arise, slay them! But the youth drew not his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a youth.
\[21]Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall on us; for as is the man, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna; and he took the moons that were on their camels' necks.
\[22]And the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also; for thou hast saved us from the hand of Midian.
\[23]And Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: Jehovah will rule over you.
\[24]And Gideon said to them, I would desire a request of you: give me every man the earrings of his booty; for they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.
\[25]And they said, We will willingly give [them]. And they spread a garment, and cast therein every man the earrings of his booty.
\[26]And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand seven hundred [shekels] of gold; besides the moons, and eardrops, and the purple garments that were on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels' necks.
\[27]And Gideon made an ephod of them, and put it in his city, in Ophrah. And all Israel went thither a whoring after it; and it became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.
\[28]And Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.

\[30]Now Gideon had seventy sons who had come out of his loins, for he had many wives.
\[31]And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, and he gave him the name of Abimelech.
\[32]And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.
\[33]And it came to pass when Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after the Baals, and set up Baal-Berith as their god.
\[34]And the children of Israel remembered not Jehovah their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side.

\[12]Then said the trees to the vine, Come thou, reign over us.
\[13]And the vine said to them, Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go to wave over the trees?
\[14]Then said all the trees to the thorn-bush, Come thou, reign over us.
\[15]And the thorn-bush said to the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, come, put confidence in my shadow; but if not, fire shall come out of the thorn-bush and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
\[16]Now therefore, if ye have dealt truly and sincerely in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and if ye have done to him according to the deserving of his hands;
\[17]—for my father fought for you, and endangered his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian;
\[18]but ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy men, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his handmaid, king over the citizens of Shechem, because he is your brother;
\[19]—if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you;
\[20]but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the citizens of Shechem and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the citizens of Shechem and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.
\[21]And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, because of Abimelech his brother.
\[22]And Abimelech ruled over Israel three years.
\[23]And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the citizens of Shechem; and the citizens of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,
\[24]that the violence [done] to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, who slew them, and upon the citizens of Shechem, who had strengthened his hands to slay his brethren.
\[25]And the citizens of Shechem set liers in wait for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them. And it was told Abimelech.
\[26]And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem; and the citizens of Shechem put confidence in him.
\[27]And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode [the grapes], and made rejoicings, and went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.
\[28]And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is he not the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his overseer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem! and why should *we* serve him?
\[29]Oh! would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.
\[30]And Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, and his anger was kindled;
\[31]and he sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Shechem, and behold, they shut up the city against thee;
\[32]and now, rise up by night, thou and the people that are with thee, and lie in ambush in the fields.
\[33]And it shall be in the morning when the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and fall upon the city; and behold, he and the people that is with him shall come out against thee, and thou shalt do with him as thou shalt find occasion.
\[34]And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they lay in ambush against Shechem in four companies.
\[35]And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city. Then Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, out of the ambush.
\[36]And Gaal saw the people, and said to Zebul, Behold, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains. And Zebul said to him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as men.
\[37]And Gaal spoke again, and said, Behold, people are coming down from the high part of the land, and one company is coming along by the way of the Magician's oak.
\[38]Then said Zebul to him, Where is now thy mouth, thou that saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out now, I pray, and fight against them.
\[39]And Gaal went out before the citizens of Shechem, and fought against Abimelech.
\[40]And Abimelech pursued him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, as far as the entrance of the gate.
\[41]And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah. And Zebul drove out Gaal and his brethren, that they might not dwell in Shechem.
\[42]And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
\[43]And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and lay in ambush in the field. And he looked, and behold, the people came forth out of the city; and he rose up against them and smote them.
\[44]And Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and two of the companies ran upon all that were in the fields, and slew them.
\[45]And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that were in it, and broke down the city, and sowed it with salt.
\[46]And all the men of the tower of Shechem heard [that], and they entered into the stronghold of the house of the god Berith.
\[47]And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem had gathered together.
\[48]Then Abimelech went up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up and laid it on his shoulder, and said to the people that was with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, do as I have done.
\[49]And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and they followed Abimelech, and put [them] to the hold, and burned the hold with fire upon them. And all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
\[50]And Abimelech went to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
\[51]But there was a strong tower in the midst of the city, and thither fled all the men and women, all the citizens of the city; and they shut it behind them, and went up to the roof of the tower.
\[52]And Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and he drew near to the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire;
\[53]and a woman cast the upper stone of a handmill on Abimelech's head, and crushed his skull.
\[54]Then he called hastily to the young man that carried his armour, and said to him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that they say not of me, A woman killed him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
\[55]And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they went every man to his place.
\[56]And God rendered back the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father in slaying his seventy brethren.
\[57]And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render back upon their heads; and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.

\[2]And he judged Israel twenty-three years; and he died, and was buried in Shamir.
\[3]And after him rose up Jair, a Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty-two years.
\[4]And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty ass colts; and they had thirty cities, which are called the villages of Jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
\[5]And Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.
\[6]And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baals, and the Ashtoreths, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook Jehovah, and served him not.
\[7]And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel, and he sold him into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon.
\[8]And they oppressed and crushed the children of Israel in that year; eighteen years [they oppressed] all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
\[9]And the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; and Israel was greatly distressed.
\[10]And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served the Baals.
\[11]And Jehovah said to the children of Israel, Did I not [save you] from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
\[12]The Zidonians also, and Amalek and Maon oppressed you, and ye cried to me, and I saved you out of their hand.
\[13]But ye have forsaken me, and served other gods; therefore I will save you no more.
\[14]Go and cry to the gods that ye have chosen: let them save you in the time of your trouble.
\[15]And the children of Israel said to Jehovah, We have sinned. Do thou unto us according to all that is good in thy sight; only deliver us, we pray thee, this day.
\[16]And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served Jehovah; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
\[17]And the children of Ammon were called together and encamped in Gilead; and the children of Israel gathered together and encamped in Mizpeh.
\[18]And the people, the chief men of Gilead, said one to another, Who is the man that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

ow Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of a harlot; and Gilead had begotten Jephthah.
\[2]And Gilead's wife bore him sons; and when his wife's sons were grown, they expelled Jephthah, and said to him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of another woman.
\[3]Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob. And vain men were gathered to Jephthah, and they made expeditions with him.
\[4]And it came to pass after some time, that the children of Ammon fought with Israel.
\[5]And when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob.
\[6]And they said to Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight against the children of Ammon.
\[7]And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come to me now when ye are in trouble?
\[8]And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore we have returned to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be head over all of us the inhabitants of Gilead.
\[9]And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If ye take me back to fight against the children of Ammon, and Jehovah give them up before me, shall I be your head?
\[10]And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Jehovah be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words!
\[11]Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them; and Jephthah uttered all his words before Jehovah in Mizpah.
\[12]And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight against my land?
\[13]And the king of the children of Ammon said to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok and unto the Jordan; and now restore it peaceably.
\[14]And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon,
\[15]and said to him, Thus saith Jephthah: Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon.
\[16]But when they came up from Egypt, then Israel walked through the wilderness as far as the Red sea, and came to Kadesh.
\[17]And Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the king of Edom would not hearken. And they also sent to the king of Moab; and he would not. And Israel abode in Kadesh.
\[18]And they walked through the wilderness, and went round the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and came by the east of the land of Moab, and encamped beyond the Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab, for the Arnon is the border of Moab.
\[19]And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land unto my place.
\[20]But Sihon trusted not Israel, to let him pass through his border, and Sihon gathered all his people, and they encamped in Jahzah; and he fought with Israel.
\[21]And Jehovah the God of Israel gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them; and Israel took possession of the whole land of the Amorites, who dwelt in that country.
\[22]And they possessed all the borders of the Amorites, from the Arnon unto the Jabbok, and from the wilderness unto the Jordan.
\[23]And now Jehovah the God of Israel has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou take possession of it?
\[24]Dost not thou possess what Chemosh thy god puts thee in possession of? and whatever Jehovah our God has dispossessed before us, that will we possess.
\[25]And now art thou indeed better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive with Israel? did he ever fight against them?
\[26]While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its dependent villages, and in Aroer and its dependent villages, and in all the cities that are along the banks of the Arnon, three hundred years—why did ye not recover [them] within that time?
\[27]So I have not sinned against thee, but it is thou who doest me wrong in making war against me. Jehovah, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon!
\[28]But the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not to the words of Jephthah that he had sent him.
\[29]Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and passed to Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.
\[30]And Jephthah vowed a vow to Jehovah, and said, If thou wilt without fail give the children of Ammon into my hand,
\[31]then shall that which cometh forth from the door of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, be Jehovah's, and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering.
\[32]And Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Jehovah gave them into his hand.
\[33]And he smote them from Aroer until thou come to Minnith, twenty cities, even unto Abel-Cheramim, with a very great slaughter; and the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
\[34]And Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house, and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambours and with dances; and she was an only child: besides her he had neither son nor daughter.
\[35]And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his garments, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me; for I have opened my mouth to Jehovah, and I cannot go back.
\[36]And she said to him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth to Jehovah, do to me according to that which has proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as Jehovah has taken vengeance for thee upon thine enemies, upon the children of Ammon.
\[37]And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: leave me alone two months, that I may go and descend to the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.
\[38]And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months. And she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
\[39]And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, and he performed on her the vow that he had vowed; and she had known no man. And it became a fixed custom in Israel,
\[40]that from year to year the daughters of Israel go to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.

\[2]And Jephthah said to them, I was at great strife, I and my people, with the children of Ammon; and I called you, but ye saved me not out of their hand.
\[3]And when I saw that ye would not save me, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Jehovah gave them into my hand. Why then are ye come up to me this day, to fight against me?
\[4]And Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye, Gilead, ye are fugitives of Ephraim in the midst of Ephraim, [and] in the midst of Manasseh.
\[5]And Gilead took the fords of the Jordan before Ephraim; and it came to pass that when the fugitives of Ephraim said, Let me go over, the men of Gilead said to him, Art thou an Ephraimite? and he said, No.

\[3]And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold now, thou art barren and bearest not; but thou shalt conceive and bear a son.
\[4]And now beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat nothing unclean.
\[5]For lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son, and no razor shall come on his head; for the boy shall be a Nazarite of God from the womb; and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
\[6]And the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like the appearance of an angel of God, very terrible; but I did not ask him whence he was, neither did he tell me his name.
\[7]And he said to me, Behold, thou shalt conceive and bear a son; and now drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not anything unclean; for the boy shall be a Nazarite of God from the womb to the day of his death.
\[8]Then Manoah prayed to Jehovah, and said, Ah Lord! let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, I pray thee, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.
\[9]And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the Angel of God came again to the woman whilst she sat in the field; but Manoah her husband was not with her.
\[10]Then the woman hasted and ran, and informed her husband, and said to him, Behold, the man has appeared to me, that came to me that day.
\[11]And Manoah rose up and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Art thou the man that didst speak to the woman? And he said, I am.
\[12]And Manoah said, When thy words then come to pass, what shall be the child's manner and his doing?
\[13]And the Angel of Jehovah said to Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware:
\[14]she shall not eat of anything that cometh of the vine, neither shall she drink wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean: all that I commanded her shall she observe.
\[15]And Manoah said to the Angel of Jehovah, I pray thee, let us detain thee, and we will make ready a kid of the goats for thee.
\[16]And the Angel of Jehovah said to Manoah, Though thou shouldest detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt offer a burnt-offering, thou shalt offer it up to Jehovah. For Manoah knew not that he was the Angel of Jehovah.
\[17]And Manoah said to the Angel of Jehovah, What is thy name, that when thy word cometh to pass we may do thee honour?
\[18]And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, How is it that thou askest after my name, seeing it is wonderful?
\[19]Then Manoah took the kid and the oblation, and offered it up to Jehovah upon the rock. And he did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.
\[20]And it came to pass, as the flame went up from off the altar towards the heavens, that the Angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar; and Manoah and his wife looked on, and fell on their faces to the ground.
\[21]And the Angel of Jehovah appeared no more to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that it was the Angel of Jehovah.
\[22]And Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
\[23]But his wife said to him, If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and an oblation at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would he at this time have told us [such things] as these.

\[3]And his father and his mother said to him, Is there no woman among the daughters of thy brethren, and among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the Philistines, the uncircumcised? And Samson said to his father, Take her for me, for she pleases me well.
\[4]And his father and his mother did not know that it was of Jehovah, that he was seeking an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.
\[5]And Samson went down, and his father and his mother, to Timnathah; and they came to the vineyards of Timnathah. And behold, a young lion roared against him;
\[6]and the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he rent it as one rends a kid, and nothing was in his hand. And he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.
\[7]And he went down and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.
\[8]And he returned after a time to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion; and behold, [there was] a swarm of bees in the carcase of the lion, and honey;
\[9]and he took it out in his hands, and went on, and ate as he went. And he came to his father and to his mother, and gave them, and they ate; but he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.
\[10]And his father went down to the woman, and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
\[11]And it came to pass when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions, and they were with him.
\[12]And Samson said to them, Let me now propound a riddle to you; if ye clearly explain it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find [it] out, then I will give you thirty shirts, and thirty changes of garments.
\[13]But if ye cannot explain [it] to me, then shall ye give me thirty shirts, and thirty changes of garments. And they said to him, Propound thy riddle, that we may hear it.
\[14]And he said to them, Out of the eater came forth food, And out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days explain the riddle.
\[15]And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, Persuade thy husband, that he may explain to us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire. Have ye invited us to impoverish us,—is it not [so]?
\[16]And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not. Thou hast propounded the riddle to the children of my people, and hast not explained it to me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not explained it to my father nor my mother, and shall I explain it to thee?
\[17]And she wept before him the seven days, while they had the feast. And it came to pass on the seventh day, that he explained it to her, for she pressed him. And she explained the riddle to the children of her people.
\[18]And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey, And what stronger than a lion? And he said to them, If ye had not ploughed with my heifer, Ye had not found out my riddle.
\[19]And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew of them thirty men, and took their spoil, and gave the changes of garments unto them that explained the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.

\[2]And her father said, I verily thought that thou didst utterly hate her; therefore I gave her to thy companion. Is not her younger sister fairer than she? Let her, I pray thee, be thine instead of her.
\[3]And Samson said to them, This time I am blameless toward the Philistines, though I do them harm.
\[4]And Samson went and caught three hundred jackals, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the midst between the two tails.
\[5]And he set the torches on fire, and let [them] run into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, and the olive gardens.

\[11]Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the cliff Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines rule over us? And what is this that thou hast done to us? And he said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.
\[12]And they said to him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may give thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me that ye will not fall on me yourselves.
\[13]And they spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand; but we certainly shall not put thee to death. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the cliff.
\[14]When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him. And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and the cords that were on his arms became as threads of flax that are burned with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.

\[16]And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, a heap, two heaps, With the jawbone of an ass have I slain a thousand men.
\[17]And it came to pass when he had ended speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath-Lehi.
\[18]And he was very thirsty, and called on Jehovah, and said, Thou hast given by the hand of thy servant this great deliverance, and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?
\[19]And God clave the hallow rock which was in Lehi, and water came out of it. And he drank, and his spirit came again, and he revived. Therefore its name was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.
\[20]And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.

nd Samson went to Gazah, and saw there a harlot, and went in to her.
\[2][And it was told] the Gazathites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they surrounded [him], and laid wait for him all night at the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning light we will kill him.
\[3]And Samson lay till midnight; and he arose at midnight, and seized the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and tore them up with the bar, and put [them] upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron.
\[4]And it came to pass afterwards that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
\[5]And the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, Persuade him, and see in what his great strength is, and with what we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to overpower him; and we will each give thee eleven hundred silver-pieces.
\[6]Then Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, in what is thy great strength, and with what thou mightest be bound to overpower thee.
\[7]And Samson said to her, If they should bind me with seven fresh cords which have not been dried, then should I be weak, and be as another man.
\[8]Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh cords which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
\[9]Now she had liers in wait abiding in the chamber; and she said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson! And he broke the cords, as a thread of tow is broken when it touches the fire; and his strength was not known.
\[10]And Delilah said to Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me and told me lies. Now tell me, I pray thee, with what thou mightest be bound.
\[11]And he said to her, If they should bind me fast with new ropes, with which no work has been done, then should I be weak, and be as another man.
\[12]And Delilah took new ropes, and bound him with them, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson! Now there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he broke them from off his arms like a thread.
\[13]And Delilah said to Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me and told me lies. Tell me with what thou mightest be bound. And he said to her, If thou shouldest weave the seven locks of my head with the web.
\[14]And she fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson! And he awoke out of his sleep, and tore out the pin of the beam, and the web.
\[15]Then she said to him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? these three times hast thou mocked me, and hast not told me in what is thy great strength.
\[16]And it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him, that his soul was vexed unto death;
\[17]and he told her all his heart, and said to her, There has not come a razor upon my head; for I am a Nazarite of God from my mother's womb; if I should be shaven, then my strength would go from me, and I should be weak, and be like all mankind.
\[18]And Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, and she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this time, for he has told me all his heart. And the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought the money in their hand.
\[19]And she made him sleep upon her knees, and called a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to overpower him, and his strength went from him.
\[20]And she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson! And he awoke out of his sleep, and thought, I will go out as at other times before, and disengage myself. And he knew not that Jehovah had departed from him.
\[21]And the Philistines seized him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gazah, and bound him with fetters of bronze; and he had to grind in the prison-house.
\[22]But the hair of his head began to grow after he was shaved.
\[23]Then the lords of the Philistines gathered together to sacrifice a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hands.
\[24]And when the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, Our god has given into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, even him who multiplied our slain.
\[25]And it came to pass when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison-house, and he played before them; and they set him between the pillars.
\[26]And Samson said to the lad that held him by the hand, Let loose of me, and suffer me to feel the pillars upon which the house stands, that I may lean upon them.
\[27]Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and upon the roof there were about three thousand men and women, who looked on while Samson made sport.
\[28]And Samson called to Jehovah, and said, Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may take one vengeance upon the Philistines for my two eyes.
\[29]And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood (and he supported himself upon them), the one with his right hand and the other with his left.
\[30]And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines! And he bowed himself with might; and the house fell on the lords, and on all the people that were therein. So the dead that he slew at his death were more than those whom he had slain in his life.
\[31]And his brethren came down, and all the house of his father, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zoreah and Eshtaol in the sepulchre of Manoah his father. And he had judged Israel twenty years.

nd there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
\[2]And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred silver-pieces that were taken from thee, and about which thou didst curse and speak of in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be my son of Jehovah!
\[3]And he restored the eleven hundred silver-pieces to his mother; and his mother said, I had dedicated the silver to Jehovah from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image; and now I will restore it to thee.
\[4]Now he restored the silver to his mother; and his mother took two hundred silver-pieces and gave them to the founder, and he made of them a graven image and a molten image; and they were in the house of Micah.
\[5]And the man Micah had a house of gods, and made an ephod and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
\[6]In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
\[7]And there was a young man out of Bethlehem-Judah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
\[8]And the man departed from the city, from Bethlehem-Judah, to sojourn where he might find [a place]. And as he journeyed, he came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah.
\[9]And Micah said to him, Whence comest thou? And he said to him, I am a Levite of Bethlehem-Judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find [a place].
\[10]And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give thee yearly ten silver-pieces, and a suit of garments, and thy victuals. And the Levite went in.
\[11]And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.
\[12]And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
\[13]Then said Micah, Now I know that Jehovah will do me good, because I have the Levite for priest.

n those days there was no king in Israel, and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought for themselves an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day [their lot] had not fallen to them for inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
\[2]And the children of Dan sent of their family five men of their whole number, men of valour, from Zoreah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to examine it; and they said to them, Go, examine the land. And they came to the hill-country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.
\[3]When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man, the Levite; and they turned in thither, and said to him, Who brought thee hither? and what doest thou in this [place]? and what hast thou here?
\[4]And he said to them, Thus and thus has Micah done to me; and he has hired me, and I am his priest.
\[5]And they said to him, Inquire, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way on which we go shall be prosperous.
\[6]And the priest said to them, Go in peace: before Jehovah is your way on which ye go.
\[7]And the five men departed, and came to Laish; and they saw the people that were therein, dwelling securely, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and no one was in the land who possessed authority, that might put [them] to shame in anything; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had nothing to do with [any] man.
\[8]—And they came to their brethren at Zoreah and Eshtaol. And their brethren said to them, What [say] ye?
\[9]And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good; and ye are still! Be not slothful to go, to enter to take possession of the land.
\[10]When ye go in, ye shall come to a people secure, and the land is spacious in every direction; for God has given it into your hands; [it is] a place where there is no want of anything that is on the earth.
\[11]And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zoreah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girded with weapons of war.
\[12]And they went up and encamped in Kirjath-jearim, in Judah; therefore they call that place Mahaneh-Dan to this day: behold, it is behind Kirjath-jearim.
\[13]And they passed thence to mount Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
\[14]Then the five men that had gone to spy out the country of Laish spoke and said to their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? And now ye know what to do.
\[15]And they turned thither, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, the house of Micah, and inquired after his welfare.
\[16]And the six hundred men of the children of Dan, girded with their weapons of war, stood at the entrance of the gate.
\[17]And the five men that had gone to spy out the land went up, entered in thither, [and] took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image; and the priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men that were girded with weapons of war.
\[18]And these came into Micah's house, and took the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. And the priest said to them, What do ye?
\[19]And they said to him, Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for thee to be a priest for the house of one man, or to be priest for a tribe and a family in Israel?
\[20]Then the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.
\[21]And they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the baggage before them.
\[22]They were already far from the house of Micah, when the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.
\[23]And they cried to the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said to Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?
\[24]And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away; and what have I more? and what is this that ye say to me, What aileth thee?
\[25]And the children of Dan said to him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest men of exasperated spirit run upon you, and thou lose thy life and the lives of thy household.
\[26]And the children of Dan went their way; and Micah saw that they were too strong for him, and he turned and went back to his house.
\[27]And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest that he had had, and came upon Laish, upon a people quiet and secure; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burned the city with fire.
\[28]And there was no deliverer, for it was far from Zidon, and they had nothing to do with [any] man; and it [lay] in the valley that is by Beth-rehob. And they built the city and dwelt therein.
\[29]And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel; howbeit Laish was the name of the city at the first.
\[30]And the children of Dan set up the graven image; and Jehonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses; he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.
\[31]And they set up for themselves Micah's graven image, which he had made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

nd it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that a certain Levite, sojourning on the further side of mount Ephraim, took him a concubine out of Bethlehem-Judah.
\[2]And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him to her father's house to Bethlehem-Judah, and was there some time,—four months.
\[3]And her husband rose up and went after her, to speak kindly to her, to bring her again; and his servant was with him, and a couple of asses. And she brought him into her father's house; and when the father of the damsel saw him he rejoiced to meet him.
\[4]And his father-in-law, the damsel's father, retained him, and he abode with him three days; and they ate and drank, and lodged there.
\[5]And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart; and the damsel's father said to his son-in-law, Refresh thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterwards ye may go your way.
\[6]And they sat down, and ate and drank, both of them together. And the damsel's father said to the man, Be content, I pray thee, and pass the night, and let thy heart be glad.
\[7]And the man rose up to depart, but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again.
\[8]And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; but the damsel's father said, Refresh thy heart, I pray thee. And they lingered until the afternoon, and they did eat both of them.
\[9]And the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant; and his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said to him, Behold now, the day draws toward evening—I pray you stay all night; behold, the day is declining, lodge here, and let thy heart be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go to thy tent.
\[10]But the man would not tarry the night; and he rose up and departed, and came opposite to Jebus, that is, Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, and his concubine was with him.
\[11]They were near Jebus, and the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
\[12]But his master said to him, We will not turn aside into the city of a stranger, which is not of the children of Israel, but we will pass on to Gibeah.
\[13]And he said to his servant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places, and lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
\[14]And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them [when they were] by Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.
\[15]And they turned aside thither, to go in, to lodge in Gibeah. And he went in, and sat down in the open place of the city; and there was no one that received him into his house to pass the night.
\[16]And behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even; and the man was of mount Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjaminites.
\[17]And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the open place of the city; and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?
\[18]And he said to him, We are travelling from Bethlehem-Judah towards the further side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I; and I went to Bethlehem-Judah, and I have to do with the house of Jehovah; and there is no man that receives me into his house.
\[19]And we have both straw and provender for our asses; and I have bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man with thy servants: there is no lack of anything.
\[20]Then the old man said, Peace be with thee; only let all thy wants lie on me; but lodge not in the street.
\[21]And he brought him into his house, and gave the asses provender; and they washed their feet, and ate and drank.
\[22]They were making their hearts merry, when behold, the men of the city, sons of Belial, surrounded the house, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him.
\[23]And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, No, my brethren, I pray you, do not wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this villany.
\[24]Behold, my daughter, who is a virgin, and his concubine; let me bring them out, and humble ye them, and do to them as is good in your sight; but to this man do not so vile a thing.
\[25]But the men would not hearken to him; and the man took his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning; and let her go when the morning-dawn arose.
\[26]And the woman came at the dawning of the day, and fell down at the entrance of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.
\[27]And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the door of the house, and went out to go his way, and behold, there lay the woman his concubine at the entrance of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold.
\[28]And he said to her, Up, and let us go; but no one answered. And he took her upon the ass; and the man rose up, and went to his place.
\[29]And when he was come into his house, he took the knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, according to her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the borders of Israel.
\[30]And it came to pass that every one that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came out of Egypt to this day. Think it over, advise, and speak.

\[2]And the heads of all the people, of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the congregation of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
\[3]And the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah. And the children of Israel said, Tell [us], how was this wickedness?
\[4]Then the Levite, the husband of the woman that was murdered, answered and said, I came to Gibeah that [belongs] to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
\[5]And the citizens of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house because of me, by night; they thought to slay me, and my concubine have they humbled so that she died.
\[6]Then I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and villany in Israel.
\[7]Behold, all ye, children of Israel, deliberate and give here [your] counsel.
\[8]And all the people rose up as one man, saying, We will not any one go to his tent, neither will we any one turn into his house.
\[9]But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: [we go] by lot against it;
\[10]and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand of ten thousand, to fetch victuals for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the villany that they have wrought in Israel.
\[11]And all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
\[12]And the tribes of Israel sent men to all the families of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that has been done among you?
\[13]And now give up the men, the sons of Belial, who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But [the children of] Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.
\[14]And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities of Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.
\[15]And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities, twenty-six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
\[16]Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left-handed; all these slang stones at a hair [breadth], and missed not.
\[17]And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.
\[18]And the children of Israel arose and went up to Bethel, and inquired of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And Jehovah said, Judah first.
\[19]And the children of Israel rose up in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.
\[20]And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.
\[21]And the children of Benjamin went forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty-two thousand men.
\[22]And the people, the men of Israel, took courage, and set the battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.
\[23]And the children of Israel went up and wept before Jehovah until even, and inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And Jehovah said, Go up against him.
\[24]And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.
\[25]And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and again destroyed to the ground of the children of Israel eighteen thousand men: all these drew the sword.
\[26]Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up and came to Bethel, and wept, and abode there before Jehovah, and fasted that day until even, and offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah.
\[27]And the children of Israel inquired of Jehovah (and the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
\[28]and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And Jehovah said, Go up; for to-morrow I will give them into thy hand.
\[29]And Israel set liers in wait against Gibeah, round about.
\[30]And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at the other times.
\[31]And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city, and began to smite of the people, slaying as at the former times, in the highways, of which one leads to Bethel and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
\[32]And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. And the children of Israel said, Let us flee, that we may draw them from the city to the highways.
\[33]And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baal-Tamar; and the ambush of Israel rushed forth out of their place, out of the meadows of Geba.
\[34]And there came from opposite Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was severe; but they knew not that disaster was coming upon them.
\[35]And Jehovah smote Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjaminites that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men: all these drew the sword.
\[36]And the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten.—And the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted to the ambush that they had set against Gibeah.
\[37]And the ambush hasted, and fell upon Gibeah; and the ambush drew along, and smote the whole city with the edge of the sword.
\[38]Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambush, that they should make a thick column of smoke rise up out of the city.
\[39]And when the men of Israel turned back in the battle, Benjamin began to smite, slaying of the men of Israel about thirty men; for they said, Surely they are quite routed before us as in the first battle.
\[40]And when the burning began to rise up out of the city as a pillar of smoke, Benjamin looked behind, and behold, the whole city ascended [in smoke] to the heavens.
\[41]Then the men of Israel turned back, and the men of Benjamin were amazed, for they saw that disaster was come upon them.
\[42]And they turned before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in their midst.
\[43]They encompassed the Benjaminites, chased them, trode them down at the resting-place over against Gibeah toward the sun-rising.
\[44]And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men: all these, men of valour.
\[45]And they turned and fled towards the wilderness to the cliff of Rimmon, and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them to Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.
\[46]So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men that drew the sword: all these, men of valour.
\[47]And six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness to the cliff of Rimmon, and abode at the cliff of Rimmon four months.
\[48]And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of [every] city as the cattle, and all that was found; even all the cities that were found did they set on fire.

\[2]And the people came to Bethel, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices and wept bitterly,
\[3]and said, Jehovah, God of Israel, why is it come to pass in Israel, that there should be this day one tribe lacking in Israel?
\[4]And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.
\[5]And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation to Jehovah? For they had [made] a great oath concerning him that came not up to Jehovah to Mizpah, saying, He shall certainly be put to death.
\[6]And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, To-day is one tribe extirpated from Israel.
\[7]What shall we do for wives for them that remain? since we have sworn by Jehovah that we will not give them of our daughters for wives.
\[8]And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpah to Jehovah? And behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-Gilead, to the congregation;
\[9]for the people were numbered, and behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead there.
\[10]And the assembly sent thither twelve thousand men of the most valiant and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead with the edge of the sword, and the women and the children.
\[11]And this is the thing which ye shall do: ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain with man.
\[12]And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead four hundred young women that were virgins, who had known no man by lying with any male, and they brought them to the camp, to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
\[13]And the whole assembly sent to speak to the children of Benjamin that were at the cliff of Rimmon, and to proclaim peace to them.
\[14]And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them the wives whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-Gilead; but even so they found not enough for them.
\[15]And the people repented them for Benjamin, because Jehovah had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
\[16]And the elders of the assembly said, What shall we do for wives for them that remain? for the women have been destroyed out of Benjamin.
\[17]And they said, There must be a possession for those of Benjamin that have escaped, that a tribe be not blotted out of Israel.
\[18]But we cannot give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to the Benjaminites!
\[19]And they said, Behold, there is a feast of Jehovah from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north side of Bethel, toward the sun-rising of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
\[20]And they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;
\[21]and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
\[22]And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to complain to us, that we will say to them, Gratify us with them, because we did not take each man his wife in the war; for ye did not give them to them, that ye should now be guilty.
\[23]And the children of Benjamin did so, and took wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught; and they went and returned to their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them.
\[24]And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
\[25]In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.

nd it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man went from Bethlehem-Judah, to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
\[2]And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem-Judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
\[3]And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.
\[4]And they took them Moabitish wives; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the second Ruth: and they abode there about ten years.
\[5]And Mahlon and Chilion died also, both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.
\[6]And she arose, she and her daughters-in-law, and returned from the fields of Moab; for she had heard in the fields of Moab how that Jehovah had visited his people to give them bread.
\[7]Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she had been, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.
\[8]And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each to her mother's house. Jehovah deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead and with me.
\[9]Jehovah grant you that ye may find rest, each in the house of her husband. And she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice and wept.
\[10]And they said to her, We will certainly return with thee to thy people.
\[11]And Naomi said, Return, my daughters: why will ye go with me? Are there yet sons in my womb, that they could be your husbands?
\[12]Return, my daughters, go; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, should I even have a husband to-night, and should I also bear sons,
\[13]would ye wait on that account till they were grown? Would ye stay on that account from having husbands? No, my daughters, for I am in much more bitterness than you; for the hand of Jehovah is gone out against me.
\[14]And they lifted up their voice and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clave to her.
\[15]And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back to her people and to her gods: return after thy sister-in-law.
\[16]And Ruth said, Do not intreat me to leave thee, to return from [following] after thee; for whither thou goest I will go, and where thou lodgest I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God;
\[17]where thou diest will I die, and there will I be buried. Jehovah do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part me and thee!
\[18]And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking to her.
\[19]And they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they came to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and the [women] said, Is this Naomi?
\[20]And she said to them, Call me not Naomi—call me Mara; for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
\[21]I went out full, and Jehovah has brought me home again empty. Why do ye call me Naomi, seeing Jehovah has brought me low, and the Almighty has afflicted me?
\[22]So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the fields of Moab; and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of the barley-harvest.

nd Naomi had a relation of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.
\[2]And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me, I pray, go to the field and glean among the ears of corn after [him] in whose sight I shall find favour. And she said to her, Go, my daughter.
\[3]And she went; and she came and gleaned in the fields after the reapers; and she chanced to light on an allotment of Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
\[4]And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem; and he said to the reapers, Jehovah be with you! And they said to him, Jehovah bless thee!
\[5]And Boaz said to his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose maiden is this?
\[6]And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish maiden who came back with Naomi out of the fields of Moab;
\[7]and she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the reapers. And she came, and has continued from the morning until now: her sitting in the house has been little as yet.
\[8]And Boaz said to Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from here, but keep here with my maidens.
\[9]Let thine eyes be on the field which is being reaped, and go thou after them; have I not charged the young men not to touch thee? And when thou art athirst, go to the vessels and drink of what the young men draw.
\[10]Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favour in thine eyes, that thou shouldest regard me, seeing I am a foreigner?
\[11]And Boaz answered and said to her, It has fully been shewn me, all that thou hast done to thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come to a people that thou hast not known heretofore.
\[12]Jehovah recompense thy work, and let thy reward be full from Jehovah the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.
\[13]And she said, Let me find favour in thine eyes, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken kindly to thy handmaid, though I am not like one of thy handmaidens.
\[14]And Boaz said to her at mealtime, Come hither and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers; and he reached her parched corn, and she ate and was sufficed, and reserved [some].
\[15]And when she rose up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and ye shall not reproach her.
\[16]And ye shall also sometimes draw out for her [some ears] out of the handfuls, and leave them that she may glean, and rebuke her not.
\[17]And she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out what she had gleaned; and it was about an ephah of barley.
\[18]And she took [it] up, and came into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had reserved after she was sufficed.
\[19]And her mother-in-law said to her, Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where hast thou wrought? Blessed be he that did regard thee! And she told her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz.
\[20]And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Jehovah, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead! And Naomi said to her, The man is near of kin to us, one of those who have the right of our redemption.
\[21]And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said to me also, Thou shalt keep with my young men until they have ended all my harvest.
\[22]And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.
\[23]So she kept with the maidens of Boaz to glean, until the end of the barley-harvest and of the wheat-harvest. And she dwelt with her mother-in-law.

\[2]And now, is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he is winnowing barley in the threshing-floor to-night.
\[3]Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thyself, and put thy raiment upon thee, and go down to the floor; make not thyself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.
\[4]And it shall be, when he lies down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall have lain down, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thyself down; and he will shew thee what thou shalt do.
\[5]And she said to her, All that thou sayest will I do.
\[6]And she went down to the floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law had bidden her.
\[7]And Boaz ate and drank, and his heart was merry, and he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn. Then she went softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid herself down.
\[8]And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was startled, and turned himself; and behold, a woman lay at his feet.
\[9]And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth, thy handmaid: spread thy skirt over thy handmaid; for thou hast the right of redemption.
\[10]And he said, Blessed be thou of Jehovah, my daughter! Thou hast shewn more kindness at the end than at the first, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.
\[11]And now, my daughter, fear not: all that thou sayest will I do to thee; for all the gate of my people knows that thou art a woman of worth.
\[12]And now, truly I am one that has the right of redemption, yet there is one that has the right of redemption who is nearer than I.
\[13]Stay over to-night, and it shall be in the morning, if he will redeem thee, well—let him redeem; but if he like not to redeem thee, then will I redeem thee, [as] Jehovah liveth. Lie down until the morning.
\[14]And she lay at his feet until the morning; and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the threshing-floor.
\[15]And he said, Bring the cloak that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And she held it, and he measured six [measures] of barley, and laid [it] on her; and he went into the city.
\[16]And she came to her mother-in-law; and she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.
\[17]And she said, These six [measures] of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty to thy mother-in-law.
\[18]Then she said, Be still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest until he have completed the matter this day.

nd Boaz went up to the gate, and sat down there. And behold, he that had the right of redemption, of whom Boaz had spoken, came by. And he said, Thou, such a one, turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside and sat down.
\[2]And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit down here. And they sat down.
\[3]And he said to him that had the right of redemption: Naomi, who is come back out of the country of Moab, sells the allotment that was our brother Elimelech's.
\[4]And I thought I would apprise thee of it and say, Buy [it] in the presence of the inhabitants, and in the presence of the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem [it], redeem; but if thou wilt not redeem, tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem besides thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem [it].
\[5]And Boaz said, On the day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy [it] also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
\[6]And he that had the right of redemption said, I cannot redeem [it] for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance. Redeem thou for thyself what I should redeem, for I cannot redeem [it].
\[7]Now this [was the custom] in former time in Israel concerning redemption and concerning exchange, to confirm the whole matter: a man drew off his sandal, and gave it to his neighbour, and this was the [mode of] attestation in Israel.
\[8]And he that had the right of redemption said to Boaz, Buy for thyself; and he drew off his sandal.
\[9]And Boaz said to the elders and all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi;
\[10]moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.
\[11]And all the people that were in the gate and the elders said, [We are] witnesses. Jehovah make the woman that cometh into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel; and acquire power in Ephratah, and make thyself a name in Bethlehem;
\[12]and let thy house become like the house of Pherez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which Jehovah shall give thee of this young woman.
\[13]And Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and Jehovah gave her conception, and she bore a son.
\[14]And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be Jehovah who hath not left thee this day without one that has the right of redemption, and may his name be famous in Israel!
\[15]And he shall be to thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age; for thy daughter-in-law who loves thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, has borne him.
\[16]And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it.
\[17]And the women [her] neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi. And they called his name Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
\[18]Now these are the generations of Pherez. Pherez begot Hezron,
\[19]and Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab,
\[20]and Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon,
\[21]and Salmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot Obed,

nd there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.
\[2]And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
\[3]And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of Jehovah, were there.
\[4]And it came to pass on the day that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions;
\[5]but to Hannah he used to give a double portion, for he loved Hannah; but Jehovah had shut up her womb.
\[6]And her adversary provoked her much also, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb.
\[7]And [as] he did so year by year, as often as she went up to the house of Jehovah, she provoked her thus; and she wept and did not eat.
\[8]And Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? Am not I better to thee than ten sons?
\[9]And Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk; (now Eli the priest sat upon the seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah;)
\[10]and she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Jehovah, and wept much.
\[11]And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man child, then I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
\[12]And it came to pass as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth.
\[13]Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; and Eli thought she was drunken.
\[14]And Eli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
\[15]And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before Jehovah.
\[16]Take not thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my grief and provocation have I spoken hitherto.
\[17]And Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition which thou hast asked of him.
\[18]And she said, Let thy bondwoman find grace in thy sight. And the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more [as before].
\[19]And they rose up early in the morning and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her.
\[20]And it came to pass when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel, [saying,] Because I have asked him of Jehovah.
\[21]And Elkanah her husband, and all his house, went up to sacrifice to Jehovah the yearly sacrifice and his vow.
\[22]But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, [I will wait] until the child is weaned; then will I bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and there abide for ever.
\[23]And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what is good in thy sight: abide until thou hast weaned him; only, may Jehovah fulfil his word. And the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.
\[24]And she took him up with her when she had weaned him, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a flask of wine, and brought him to the house of Jehovah to Shiloh; and the boy was young.
\[25]And they slaughtered the bullock, and brought the boy to Eli.
\[26]And she said, Oh my lord, [as] thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here to pray to Jehovah.
\[27]For this boy I prayed; and Jehovah has granted me my petition which I asked of him.
\[28]And also I have lent him to Jehovah: all the days that he lives, he is lent to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there.

\[2]There is none holy as Jehovah, for there is none beside thee, neither is there any rock like our God.
\[3]Do not multiply your words of pride, let not vain-glory come out of your mouth; For Jehovah is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
\[4]The bow of the mighty is broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
\[5]They that were full have hired themselves out for bread; and the hungry are [so] no more: Even the barren beareth seven, and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
\[6]Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up.
\[7]Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich, he bringeth low, also he lifteth up:
\[8]He raiseth up the poor out of the dust; from the dung-hill he lifteth up the needy, To set [him] among nobles; and he maketh them inherit a throne of glory; For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah's, and he hath set the world upon them.
\[9]He keepeth the feet of his saints, but the wicked are silenced in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
\[10]They that strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces; in the heavens will he thunder upon them. Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; and he will give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.
\[11]And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the boy ministered to Jehovah in the presence of Eli the priest.
\[12]Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not Jehovah.
\[13]And the priests' custom with the people was, when any man sacrificed a sacrifice, the priest's servant came, when the flesh was cooked, with a flesh-hook of three prongs in his hand;
\[14]and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot; the priest took of it all that the flesh-hook brought up. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came there.
\[15]Even before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, and he will not accept sodden flesh of thee, but raw.
\[16]If the man said to him, They will immediately burn the fat entire, then take as thy soul desires; he would say [to him], No, but thou shalt give [it] now; and if not, I will take [it] by force.
\[17]And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah, for men despised the offering of Jehovah.
\[18]And Samuel ministered before Jehovah, a boy girded with a linen ephod.
\[19]And his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to sacrifice the yearly sacrifice.
\[20]And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to Jehovah. And they went to their own home.
\[21]So Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew before Jehovah.
\[22]And Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and that they lay with the women that served at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
\[23]And he said to them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil deeds from all this people.
\[24]No, my sons, for it is no good report that I hear: ye make Jehovah's people transgress.
\[25]If one man sin against another, God will judge him; but if a man sin against Jehovah, who shall intreat for him? But they hearkened not to the voice of their father, for Jehovah was minded to slay them.
\[26]And the boy Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with Jehovah and also with men.
\[27]And there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Did I plainly reveal myself to the house of thy father when they were in Egypt, in Pharaoh's house,
\[28]and choose him out of all the tribes of Israel, to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear the ephod before me? and I gave unto the house of thy father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel.
\[29]Wherefore do ye trample upon my sacrifice and upon mine oblation which I have commanded [in my] habitation? And thou honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the primest of all the oblations of Israel my people.
\[30]Wherefore Jehovah the God of Israel saith, I said indeed, Thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever. But now Jehovah saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
\[31]Behold, days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.
\[32]And thou shalt see an oppressor [in my] habitation, amidst all the good that shall be done to Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.
\[33]And the man of thine [whom] I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to cause thine eyes to fail and to grieve thy soul; and all the increase of thy house shall die in their vigour.
\[34]And this shall be the sign to thee, which shall come upon thy two sons, upon Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die, both of them.
\[35]And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, [who] shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed continually.
\[36]And it shall come to pass [that] every one that is left of thy house shall come to crouch to him for a small piece of silver and for a cake of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priestly offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.

\[2]And it came to pass at that time, when Eli lay in his place (now his eyes began to grow dim, he could not see),
\[3]and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel lay in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was,
\[4]that Jehovah called to Samuel. And he said, Here am I.
\[5]And he ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I did not call: lie down again. And he went and lay down.
\[6]And Jehovah called again, Samuel! And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I did not call, my son: lie down again.
\[7]Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither had the word of Jehovah yet been revealed to him.
\[8]And Jehovah called again the third time, Samuel! And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah was calling the boy.
\[9]And Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down; and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah, for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
\[10]And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at the other times, Samuel, Samuel! And Samuel said, Speak, for thy servant heareth.
\[11]And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
\[12]In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house; I will begin and make an end.
\[13]For I have declared to him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he hath known: because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
\[14]And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice or oblation for ever.
\[15]And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to declare the vision to Eli.
\[16]And Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.
\[17]And he said, What is the word that he has spoken to thee? I pray thee, keep it not back from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou keep back anything from me of all the word that he spoke to thee.
\[18]And Samuel told him all the words, and kept nothing back from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what is good in his sight.
\[19]And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.
\[20]And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah.
\[21]And Jehovah appeared again at Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.

nd what Samuel had said happened to all Israel. And Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
\[2]And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel; and the battle spread, and Israel was routed before the Philistines; and they slew in battle array in the field about four thousand men.
\[3]And the people came into the camp; and the elders of Israel said, Why has Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us fetch ourselves the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.
\[4]So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who sitteth between the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there by the ark of the covenant of God.
\[5]And it came to pass when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp, that all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth shook.
\[6]And the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, and said, What is the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of Jehovah had come into the camp.
\[7]And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there has not been such a thing heretofore.
\[8]Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with every plague in the wilderness.
\[9]Shew yourselves valiant and be men, ye Philistines, that ye may not have to be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been servants to you: be men, and fight.
\[10]And the Philistines fought, and Israel was routed, and they fled every man to his tent; and there was a very great slaughter, and there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
\[11]And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
\[12]And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the battle, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head.
\[13]And when he came, behold, Eli was sitting upon the seat by the way-side watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And the man came to tell it in the city, and all the city cried out.
\[14]And Eli heard the noise of the crying, and said, What is the noise of this tumult? And the man came hastily, and told Eli.
\[15]Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were set, that he could not see.
\[16]And the man said to Eli, I am he that came out of the battle, and I have fled to-day out of the battle. And he said, What has taken place, my son?
\[17]And the messenger answered and said, Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
\[18]And it came to pass, when he mentioned the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died; for the man was old, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
\[19]And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered; and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.
\[20]And as she was dying, the women that stood by her said, Fear not; for thou hast borne a son. But she did not answer, neither did she take it to heart.
\[21]And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
\[22]And she said, The glory is departed from Israel, for the ark of God is taken.

\[3]And when they of Ashdod arose early the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
\[4]And when they arose early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the fish-stump was left to him.
\[5]Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor any that come into Dagon's house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.

\[7]And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us; for his hand is severe upon us, and upon Dagon our god.
\[8]And they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they said, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about to Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about [thither].
\[9]And it came to pass that, after they had carried it about, the hand of Jehovah was against the city with very great panic; and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and hemorrhoids broke out upon them.
\[10]And they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, when the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people.
\[11]And they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it kill us not, and our people. For there was deadly alarm throughout the city: the hand of God was very heavy there;

\[2]And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of Jehovah? tell us wherewith we shall send it to its place.
\[3]And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; ye must at any rate return him a trespass-offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
\[4]Then they said, What is the trespass-offering which we shall return to him? And they said, Five golden hemorrhoids, and five golden mice, the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague is upon them all, and upon your lords.
\[5]And ye shall make images of your hemorrhoids, and images of your mice that destroy the land, and give glory to the God of Israel: perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
\[6]And why will ye harden your heart, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their heart? When he had wrought mightily among them, did they not let them go, and they departed?
\[7]And now make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there has come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;
\[8]and take the ark of Jehovah, and lay it upon the cart, and the golden jewels, which ye return him as a trespass-offering, put in the coffer by the side thereof; and send it away that it may go.

\[10]And the men did so, and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.
\[11]And they laid the ark of Jehovah upon the cart, and the coffer with the golden mice and the images of their sores.
\[12]And the kine went straight forward on the way to Beth-shemesh; they went by the one high way, lowing as they went; and they turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh.
\[13]And [they of] Beth-shemesh were reaping the wheat-harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.
\[14]And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemeshite, and stood there; and a great stone was there. And they clave the wood of the cart, and offered up the kine as a burnt-offering to Jehovah.
\[15]And the Levites took down the ark of Jehovah, and the coffer that was with it, in which were the golden jewels, and put them on the great stone; and the men of Beth-shemesh offered up burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Jehovah.
\[16]And the five lords of the Philistines saw [it], and returned to Ekron the same day.
\[17]And these are the golden sores which the Philistines returned as a trespass-offering to Jehovah: for Ashdod one, for Gazah one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
\[18]and the golden mice, [according to] the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both fortified cities and villages of the peasantry; [and they brought them] as far as the great [stone of] Abel, whereon they set down the ark of Jehovah, [which] is to this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemeshite.
\[19]And he smote among the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of Jehovah, and smote of the people seventy men; and the people lamented, because Jehovah had smitten the people with a great slaughter.
\[20]And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Jehovah, this holy God? and to whom shall he go up from us?

\[11]And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, as far as below Beth-car.
\[12]And Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, and said, Hitherto Jehovah has helped us.
\[13]And the Philistines were subdued, and came no more into the borders of Israel; and the hand of Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
\[14]And the cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and their territory did Israel deliver out of the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorite.

\[3]And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice.

\[5]and said to him, Behold, thou art become old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now appoint us a king to judge us, like all the nations.
\[6]And the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed to Jehovah.
\[7]And Jehovah said to Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.
\[8]According to all the deeds that they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken me and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.

\[12]and [he will take them] that he may appoint for himself captains over thousands, and captains over fifties, and that they may plough his ground, and reap his harvest, and make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariots.
\[13]And he will take your daughters for perfumers, and cooks, and bakers.
\[14]And your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, the best, will he take and give to his servants.
\[15]And he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards, and give to his chamberlains and to his servants.
\[16]And he will take your bondmen, and your bondwomen, and your comeliest young men, and your asses, and use them for his work.
\[17]He will take the tenth of your sheep. And ye shall be his servants.

\[20]that we also may be like all the nations; and our king shall judge us, and go out before us, and conduct our wars.

\[2]And he had a son whose name was Saul, choice and comely; and there was not among the children of Israel a comelier person than he; from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.
\[3]And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost; and Kish said to Saul his son, Take, I pray, one of the young men with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.
\[4]And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they found [them] not; and they passed through the land of Shaalim, and they were not there; and they passed through the land of Benjamin, and they found [them] not.
\[5]They had come to the land of Zuph when Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come and let us return; lest my father give up the asses, and be anxious about us.
\[6]And he said to him, Behold now, a man of God is in this city, and the man is held in honour; all that he says comes surely to pass. Let us now go thither: perhaps he will shew us the way that we should go.
\[7]And Saul said to his servant, But if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and we have no present to give to the man of God: what have we?
\[8]And the servant answered Saul again and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver; that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.
\[9](In former time in Israel, when a man went to ask counsel of God, he said, Come and let us go to the seer; for he that is now called a Prophet was in former time called a Seer.)
\[10]And Saul said to his servant, Well said: come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was.
\[11]As they went up the ascent to the city, they met maidens going forth to draw water; and they said to them, Is the seer here?
\[12]And they answered them and said, He is; behold, he is before thee: make haste now, for he came to-day to the city; for the people have a sacrifice to-day in the high place.
\[13]As soon as ye come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people eat not until he has come, because he blesses the sacrifice; afterwards they eat that are invited. And now go up; for this very day shall ye find him.
\[14]And they went up into the city. As they were coming into the midst of the city, behold, Samuel was coming out towards them, to go up to the high place.
\[15]Now Jehovah had apprised Samuel one day before Saul came, saying,
\[16]To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him prince over my people Israel; and he will save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.
\[17]And as Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah answered him, Behold the man of whom I spoke to thee! this man shall rule over my people.
\[18]And Saul drew near to Samuel in the midst of the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.
\[19]And Samuel answered Saul and said, I am the seer: go up before me to the high place, and ye shall eat with me to-day; and to-morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.
\[20]And as for the asses that thou didst lose three days ago, set not thy heart on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel [set]? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?
\[21]And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjaminite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? and why dost thou speak such words to me?
\[22]And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the chamber, and gave them a place at the head of them that were invited; and they were about thirty persons.
\[23]And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion that I gave thee, of which I said to thee, Set it by thee.
\[24]And the cook took up the shoulder, and what was on it, and set [it] before Saul. And he said, Behold that which has been reserved! set it before thee, eat; for against the set time has it been kept for thee, since I said, I will invite the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
\[25]And they came down from the high place into the city, and he spoke with Saul upon the roof.
\[26]And they arose early; and when it was about the dawning of the day, Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, Arise, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, into the street.

\[3]And thou shalt go on forward from thence, and shalt come to the oak of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God, to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three cakes of bread, and another carrying a flask of wine.
\[4]And they will ask after thy welfare, and give thee two loaves, which thou shalt receive of their hands.

\[8]And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to thee, to offer up burnt-offerings, [and] to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings: seven days shalt thou wait, until I come to thee and inform thee what thou shalt do.
\[9]And it was [so] that when he turned his back to go away from Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all those signs came to pass that day.
\[10]And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.
\[11]And it came to pass, when all that knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
\[12]And a man of that place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
\[13]And when he had ended prophesying, he came to the high place.
\[14]And Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were nowhere, we went to Samuel.
\[15]And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said to you.
\[16]And Saul said to his uncle, He told us for certain that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel had spoken, he told him not.
\[17]And Samuel called the people together to Jehovah to Mizpah.
\[18]And he said to the children of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, *I* brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you;
\[19]but *ye* have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your troubles, and have said unto him, [Nay,] but a king shalt thou set over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes, and by your thousands.
\[20]And Samuel caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
\[21]And he caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, and the family of Matri was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken. And they sought him, but he was not to be found.
\[22]Therefore they inquired of Jehovah further, Will the man yet come hither? And Jehovah answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage.
\[23]And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
\[24]And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom Jehovah has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted and said, May the king live.
\[25]And Samuel told the people the right of the kingdom, and wrote it in the book, and laid it before Jehovah. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
\[26]And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and with him went the band, whose hearts God had touched.

\[3]Here I am: testify against me before Jehovah, and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I injured? or of whose hand have I received any ransom and blinded mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it to you.
\[4]And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, and thou hast not injured us, neither hast thou taken aught of any man's hand.
\[5]And he said to them, Jehovah is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand! And [the people] said, [He is] witness!
\[6]And Samuel said to the people, [It is] Jehovah who appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
\[7]And now stand still, that I may plead with you before Jehovah of all the righteous acts of Jehovah which he did to you and to your fathers.
\[8]When Jacob had come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to Jehovah, then Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron, and they brought your fathers forth out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.

\[10]And they cried to Jehovah and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Jehovah, and have served the Baals and the Ashtoreths; and now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
\[11]And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies round about, so that ye dwelt in safety.
\[12]But when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said to me, Nay, but a king shall reign over us; when Jehovah your God was your king.
\[13]And now behold, the king whom ye have chosen, whom ye have asked for! and behold, Jehovah has set a king over you.
\[14]If ye fear Jehovah, and serve him, and hearken to his voice, and rebel not against the commandment of Jehovah, then both ye and the king also that reigns over you shall continue following Jehovah your God.
\[15]But if ye will not hearken to the voice of Jehovah, and if ye rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, then will the hand of Jehovah be against you, as against your fathers.
\[16]Now therefore stand and see this great thing which Jehovah will do before your eyes.
\[17]Is it not wheat-harvest to-day? I will call unto Jehovah, and he will send thunder and rain; and ye shall perceive and see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of Jehovah in asking for yourselves a king.
\[18]And Samuel called to Jehovah; and Jehovah sent thunder and rain that day. And all the people greatly feared Jehovah and Samuel.
\[19]And all the people said to Samuel, Pray to Jehovah thy God for thy servants, that we die not; for we have added to all our sins the wickedness to ask for ourselves a king.
\[20]And Samuel said to the people, Fear not: *ye* have done all this wickedness; yet turn not aside from following Jehovah, and serve Jehovah with all your heart;
\[21]and turn ye not aside; for [it would be] after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.
\[22]For Jehovah will not cast away his people for his great name's sake; because it has pleased Jehovah to make you his people.
\[23]Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you; and I will teach you the good and right way.
\[24]Only, fear Jehovah, and serve him in truth, with all your heart; for see how great things he has done for you.
\[25]But if ye do wickedly, ye shall perish, both ye and your king.

aul was … years old when he became king; and he reigned two years over Israel.
\[2]And Saul chose him three thousand men out of Israel: there were with Saul two thousand in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin; and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
\[3]And Jonathan smote the outpost of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard [of it]. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
\[4]And all Israel heard say, Saul has smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and Israel also has become odious to the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
\[5]And the Philistines were assembled together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude; and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward from Beth-Aven.
\[6]And the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed); and the people hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in cliffs, and in strongholds, and in pits.
\[7]And the Hebrews went over the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead. And Saul was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
\[8]And he waited seven days, according to the set time that Samuel [had appointed]; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
\[9]And Saul said, Bring hither to me the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings. And he offered up the burnt-offering.
\[10]And it came to pass, as soon as he had ended offering up the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
\[11]And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou didst not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines were assembled at Michmash,
\[12]I said, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to Jehovah; and I forced myself, and offered up the burnt-offering.
\[13]And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of Jehovah thy God which he commanded thee; for now would Jehovah have established thy kingdom over Israel for ever.
\[14]But now thy kingdom shall not continue: Jehovah has sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah has appointed him ruler over his people; for thou hast not kept what Jehovah commanded thee.
\[15]And Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were found with him, about six hundred men.
\[16]And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were found with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin; and the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
\[17]And the ravagers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned the way of Ophrah, into the land of Shual;
\[18]and another company turned the way to Beth-horon; and the other company turned the way to the district that looks over the ravine of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
\[19]Now there was no smith found throughout the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears.
\[20]And all Israel went down to the Philistines, every man to get his ploughshare, and his hoe, and his axe, and his sickle sharpened,
\[21]when the edges of the sickles, and the hoes, and the forks, and the axes were blunted; and to set the goads.
\[22]And it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan; but with Saul and with Jonathan his son there was found.
\[23]And a garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.

ow it came to pass one day that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man that bore his armour, Come and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison which is on the other side. But he did not tell his father.
\[2]And Saul abode at the extreme end of Gibeah under the pomegranate-tree which [was] in Migron; and the people that were with him were about six hundred men.
\[3](And Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, Jehovah's priest in Shiloh, wore the ephod.) And the people did not know that Jonathan was gone.
\[4]Now between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side; and the name of the one [was] Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
\[5]The one crag [formed] a pillar on the north opposite to Michmash, and the other on the south opposite to Geba.
\[6]And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: perhaps Jehovah will work for us; for there is no restraint to Jehovah to save by many or by few.
\[7]And his armour-bearer said to him, Do all that is in thy heart; turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.
\[8]Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will shew ourselves to them.
\[9]If they say thus to us, Stand still until we come to you, then we will stay in our place, and will not go up to them.
\[10]And if they say thus, Come up to us, then we will go up; for Jehovah has given them into our hand; and this shall be the sign to us.
\[11]And both of them shewed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
\[12]And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armour-bearer and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you something. And Jonathan said to his armour-bearer, Come up after me; for Jehovah has delivered them into the hand of Israel.
\[13]And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armour-bearer after him; and they fell before Jonathan; and his armour-bearer slew after him.
\[14]And that first slaughter which Jonathan and his armour-bearer wrought was about twenty men, as it were on the half-furrow of an acre of land.
\[15]And there was trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the ravagers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked; for it was a trembling [from] God.
\[16]And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on slaying one another.
\[17]Then said Saul to the people that were with him, Muster now, and see who is gone from us. And they mustered, and behold, Jonathan and his armour-bearer were not there.
\[18]And Saul said to Ahijah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
\[19]And it came to pass while Saul talked to the priest, that the noise which was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased; and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw thy hand.
\[20]And Saul and all the people that were with him were called together, and they came to the battle; and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, a very great confusion.
\[21]And there were Hebrews with the Philistines before that time, who had gone up with them into the camp round about; and they also [turned] to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
\[22]And all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in mount Ephraim heard that the Philistines fled, and they also followed hard after them in the battle.
\[23]And Jehovah saved Israel that day; and the battle passed over beyond Beth-Aven.
\[24]But the men of Israel were distressed that day. Now Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth food until evening, and [until] I am avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted food.
\[25]And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey on the ground.
\[26]And the people had come into the wood, and behold, the honey flowed; but no man put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.
\[27]But Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the people; and he put forth the end of his staff which was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes became bright.
\[28]Then answered one of the people and said, Thy father strictly adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth food this day; and the people are faint.
\[29]And Jonathan said, My father has troubled the land: see, I pray you, that mine eyes are bright, because I tasted a little of this honey.
\[30]How much more, if the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for would there not now have been a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
\[31]And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Ajalon; and the people were very faint.
\[32]And the people fell on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground; and the people ate [them] with the blood.
\[33]And they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against Jehovah, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have acted perversely: roll me now a great stone.
\[34]And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring near to me every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slaughter them here, and eat; and sin not against Jehovah in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slaughtered [them] there.
\[35]And Saul built an altar to Jehovah: this was the first altar he built to Jehovah.
\[36]And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and plunder them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever is good in thy sight. Then said the priest, Let us come near hither to God.
\[37]And Saul inquired of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou give them into the hand of Israel? But he did not answer him that day.
\[38]And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the heads of the people; and know and see wherein this sin has been this day.
\[39]For, [as] Jehovah liveth, who has saved Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall certainly die. And no one answered him among all the people.
\[40]Then said he to all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what is good in thy sight.
\[41]And Saul said to Jehovah the God of Israel, Give a perfect [testimony]! And Jonathan and Saul were taken, and the people escaped.
\[42]And Saul said, Cast [lots] between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
\[43]And Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him and said, With the end of the staff which is in my hand I tasted a little honey, [and] behold, I must die!
\[44]And Saul said, God do so [to me] and more also; thou shalt certainly die, Jonathan.
\[45]And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far be it! [as] Jehovah liveth, there shall not a hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has wrought with God this day. So the people delivered Jonathan, that he died not.
\[46]And Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.
\[47]And Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies round about, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; and whithersoever he turned himself, he discomfited [them].
\[48]And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of their spoilers.
\[49]And the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Jishvi, and Malchi-shua. And the names of his two daughters: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.
\[50]And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz; and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
\[51]And Kish the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner were sons of Abiel.
\[52]And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him to himself.

nd Samuel said to Saul, Jehovah sent *me* to anoint thee king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken to the voice of the words of Jehovah.
\[2]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I have considered what Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.
\[3]Now go and smite Amalek, and destroy utterly all that they have, and spare them not, but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
\[4]And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
\[5]And Saul came to the city of the Amalekites, and set an ambush in the valley.
\[6]And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, and go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt. And the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
\[7]And Saul smote Amalek from Havilah as thou comest to Shur, which is opposite to Egypt.
\[8]And he took Agag the king of Amalek alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
\[9]And Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and oxen, and beasts of the second bearing, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not devote them to destruction; but everything that was mean and weak, that they destroyed utterly.
\[10]And the word of Jehovah came to Samuel, saying,
\[11]It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned away from following me, and hath not fulfilled my words. And Samuel was much grieved; and he cried to Jehovah all night.
\[12]And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning. And it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set him up a monument, and has turned about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
\[13]And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, Blessed art thou of Jehovah: I have fulfilled the word of Jehovah.
\[14]And Samuel said, What [means] then this bleating of sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of oxen which I hear?
\[15]And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites, because the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
\[16]And Samuel said to Saul, Stay, that I may tell thee what Jehovah has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.
\[17]And Samuel said, Was it not when thou wast little in thine eyes that thou [becamest] the head of the tribes of Israel, and Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel?
\[18]And Jehovah sent thee on a way and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.
\[19]Why then didst thou not hearken to the voice of Jehovah, but didst fall upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of Jehovah?
\[20]And Saul said to Samuel, I have indeed hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, and have gone the way which Jehovah sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
\[21]But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the choicest of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.
\[22]And Samuel said, Has Jehovah delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, As in hearkening to the voice of Jehovah? Behold, obedience is better than sacrifice, Attention than the fat of rams.
\[23]For rebellion is [as] the sin of divination, And selfwill is [as] iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, He hath also rejected thee from being king.
\[24]And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah, and thy words; for I feared the people, and hearkened to their voice.
\[25]And now, I pray thee, forgive my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah.
\[26]And Samuel said to Saul, I will not turn again with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah has rejected thee from being king over Israel.
\[27]And as Samuel turned to go away, [Saul] laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
\[28]Then Samuel said to him, Jehovah has rent the kingdom of Israel from thee to-day, and has given it to thy neighbour, who is better than thou.
\[29]And also the Hope of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.
\[30]And he said, I have sinned; honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah thy God.
\[31]So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped Jehovah.
\[32]And Samuel said, Bring ye near to me Agag the king of Amalek. And Agag came to him gaily. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
\[33]And Samuel said, As thy sword has made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless above women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal.
\[34]And Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
\[35]And Samuel saw Saul no more until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned over Saul; and Jehovah repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.

nd Jehovah said to Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons.
\[2]And Samuel said, How shall I go? if Saul hear [it], he will kill me. And Jehovah said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah.
\[3]And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will tell thee what thou shalt do; and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.
\[4]And Samuel did what Jehovah said, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the city came trembling to meet him, and said, Dost thou come peaceably?
\[5]And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah. Hallow yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he hallowed Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
\[6]And it came to pass when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely Jehovah's anointed is before him.
\[7]But Jehovah said to Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him; for it is not as man seeth; for man looketh upon the outward appearance, but Jehovah looketh upon the heart.
\[8]Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has Jehovah chosen this one.
\[9]Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, Neither has Jehovah chosen this one.
\[10]And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, Jehovah has not chosen these.
\[11]And Samuel said to Jesse, Are these all the young men? And he said, There is yet the youngest remaining, and behold, he is feeding the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit at table till he come hither.
\[12]And he sent and brought him in. And he was ruddy, and besides of a lovely countenance and beautiful appearance. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.
\[13]And Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren. And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
\[14]And the Spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled him.
\[15]And Saul's servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubles thee.
\[16]Let our lord now speak; thy servants are before thee: they shall seek out a man, a skilful player on a harp; and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
\[17]And Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.
\[18]And one of the young men answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skilled in playing, and he is a valiant man and a man of war, and skilled in speech, and of good presence, and Jehovah is with him.
\[19]Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.
\[20]And Jesse took an ass with bread, and a flask of wine, and a kid, and sent [them] by David his son to Saul.
\[21]And David came to Saul, and stood before him; and he loved him greatly; and he became his armour-bearer.
\[22]And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he has found favour in my sight.
\[23]And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand; and Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.

nd the Philistines assembled their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Sochoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Sochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.
\[2]And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the valley of terebinths, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
\[3]And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side; and the ravine was between them.
\[4]And there went out a champion from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
\[5]And he had a helmet of bronze upon his head, and he was clothed with a corselet of scales; and the weight of the corselet was five thousand shekels of bronze.
\[6]And he had greaves of bronze upon his legs, and a javelin of bronze between his shoulders.
\[7]And the shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron; and the shield-bearer went before him.
\[8]And he stood and cried to the ranks of Israel, and said to them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I the Philistine, and ye servants of Saul? choose for yourselves a man, and let him come down to me.
\[9]If he be able to fight with me, and to smite me, then will we be your servants; but if I overcome and smite him, then shall ye be our servants and serve us.
\[10]And the Philistine said, I have defied the ranks of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.
\[11]And Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, and they were dismayed and greatly afraid.
\[12]Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem-Judah whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons; and the man was old in the days of Saul, advanced [in years] among men.
\[13]And the three eldest of the sons of Jesse had gone and followed Saul to the battle; and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and the second to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
\[14]And David was the youngest; and the three eldest had followed Saul.
\[15]But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
\[16]And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
\[17]And Jesse said to David his son, Take, I pray, for thy brethren, this ephah of parched [corn] and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to thy brethren;
\[18]and carry these ten cheeses to the captain of the thousand, and visit thy brethren to see how they are, and take a pledge of them.
\[19]Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel [were] in the valley of terebinths, fighting against the Philistines.
\[20]And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took his charge and went, as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the wagon-defence; and the host which was going forth to the battle-array shouted for the fight.
\[21]And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, rank against rank.
\[22]And David left the things he was carrying in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran into the ranks, and came and saluted his brethren.
\[23]And as he talked with them, behold there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words; and David heard [them].
\[24]And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were greatly afraid.
\[25]And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that comes up? for to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who smites him, him will the king enrich with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.
\[26]And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that smites this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
\[27]And the people told him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that smites him.
\[28]And Eliab, his eldest brother, heard while he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why art thou come down? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.
\[29]And David said, What have I now done? Was it not laid upon me?
\[30]And he turned from him to another, and spoke after the same manner; and the people answered him again after the former manner.
\[31]And the words were heard which David spoke, and they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.
\[32]And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him: thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
\[33]And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
\[34]And David said to Saul, Thy servant fed his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and also a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock.
\[35]And I went after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I seized him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.
\[36]Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God.
\[37]And David said, Jehovah who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and Jehovah be with thee.
\[38]And Saul clothed David with his dress, and put a helmet of bronze upon his head, and clothed him with a corselet.
\[39]And David girded his sword upon his dress, and endeavoured to go; for he had not yet tried [it]. And David said to Saul, I cannot go in these; for I have never tried [them]. And David put them off him.
\[40]And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag that he had, into the pocket; and his sling was in his hand. And he drew near to the Philistine.
\[41]And the Philistine came on and approached David; and the man that bore the shield was before him.
\[42]And when the Philistine looked about and saw David, he disdained him; for he was a youth, and ruddy, and besides of a beautiful countenance.
\[43]And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
\[44]And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the fowls of the heavens and to the beasts of the field.
\[45]And David said to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with sword, and with spear, and with javelin; but I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
\[46]This day will Jehovah deliver thee up into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the camp of the Philistines this day to the fowl of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth. And all the earth shall know that Israel has a God;
\[47]and all this congregation shall know that Jehovah saves not with sword and spear; for the battle is Jehovah's, and he will give you into our hands.
\[48]And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and advanced to meet David, that David hasted, and ran towards the ranks to meet the Philistine.
\[49]And David put his hand into the bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, and the stone sank into his forehead; and he fell on his face to the earth.
\[50]So David overcame the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and smote the Philistine and killed him; and there was no sword in the hand of David.
\[51]And David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath, and killed him completely, and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they fled.
\[52]And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou comest to the ravine and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down on the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron.
\[53]And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they pillaged their camps.
\[54]And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.
\[55]And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this young man? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.
\[56]And the king said, Inquire thou whose son this youth is.
\[57]And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
\[58]And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, young man? And David said, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.

nd it came to pass, when he had ended speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
\[2]And Saul took him that day, and would not let him return to his father's house.
\[3]And Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
\[4]And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his dress, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
\[5]And David went forth; whithersoever Saul sent him he prospered; and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
\[6]And it came to pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tambours, with joy, and with triangles.
\[7]And the women answered [one another] as they played, and said, Saul hath smitten his thousands, And David his ten thousands.
\[8]And Saul was very wroth, and that saying was evil in his sight; and he said, They have ascribed to David ten thousands, but to me they have ascribed the thousands; and [what] is there more for him but the kingdom?
\[9]And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
\[10]And it came to pass the next day that an evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house, but David played with his hand, as on other days; and the spear was in Saul's hand.
\[11]And Saul cast the spear, and thought, I will smite David and the wall. But David turned away from him twice.
\[12]And Saul was afraid of David, because Jehovah was with him, and had departed from Saul.
\[13]And Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
\[14]And David prospered in all his ways; and Jehovah was with him.
\[15]And Saul saw that he prospered well, and he stood in awe of him.
\[16]But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them.
\[17]And Saul said to David, Behold my eldest daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife; only be thou valiant for me, and fight Jehovah's battles. But Saul thought, My hand shall not be upon him, but the hand of the Philistines shall be upon him.
\[18]And David said to Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, [or] my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?
\[19]And it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife.
\[20]And Michal Saul's daughter loved David; and they told Saul, and the thing was right in his sight.
\[21]And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be upon him. And Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law a second time.
\[22]And Saul commanded his servants, Speak with David secretly, saying, Behold, the king has delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son-in-law.
\[23]And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Is it a light thing in your eyes to be the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
\[24]And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner did David speak.
\[25]And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David: The king does not desire any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
\[26]And his servants told David these words; and the thing was right in David's sight to be the king's son-in-law. And the days were not expired,
\[27]when David arose and went, he and his men, and smote of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they delivered them in full to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife.
\[28]And Saul saw and knew that Jehovah was with David; and Michal Saul's daughter loved him.
\[29]And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David's enemy continually.
\[30]And the princes of the Philistines went forth; and it came to pass, whenever they went forth, that David succeeded better than all the servants of Saul; and his name was much esteemed.

nd Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should slay David.
\[2]But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David. And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill thee; and now, I pray thee, take heed to thyself in the morning, and abide in a secret place and hide thyself;
\[3]and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and will speak of thee with my father: and see what it is, and tell thee.
\[4]And Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David, because he has not sinned against thee; for also what he did was very advantageous to thee;
\[5]for he put his life in hand, and smote the Philistine, and Jehovah wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou didst see [it], and didst rejoice; why then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, in slaying David without cause?
\[6]And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul swore, [As] Jehovah liveth, he shall not be put to death!
\[7]Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan declared to him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as previously.
\[8]And there was war again; and David went forth and fought with the Philistines, and smote them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him.
\[9]And an evil spirit from Jehovah was upon Saul. And he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David played with his hand.
\[10]And Saul sought to smite David and the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the spear into the wall. And David fled, and escaped that night.
\[11]And Saul sent messengers to David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning; and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to-night, to-morrow thou wilt be put to death.
\[12]And Michal let David down through a window; and he went, and fled and escaped.
\[13]And Michal took the image, and laid it in the bed, and put the net of goats' [hair] at its head, and covered it with the coverlet.
\[14]And Saul sent messengers to take David, and she said, He is sick.
\[15]And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may put him to death.
\[16]And the messengers came in, and behold, the image was in the bed, and the net of goats' [hair] at its head.
\[17]Then Saul said to Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal said to Saul, He said to me, Let me go; why should I slay thee?
\[18]And David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
\[19]And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth by Ramah.
\[20]Then Saul sent messengers to take David; and they saw a company of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as president over them; and the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
\[21]And it was told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.
\[22]Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Sechu; and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, at Naioth by Ramah.
\[23]And he went thither to Naioth by Ramah; and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth by Ramah.
\[24]And he himself also stripped off his clothes, and prophesied, himself also, before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?

nd David fled from Naioth by Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity, and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeks my life?
\[2]And he said to him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, and not apprise me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.
\[3]And David swore again and again, and said, Thy father certainly knows that I have found favour in thy sight: and he has thought, Jonathan shall not know this, lest he be grieved; but truly [as] Jehovah liveth, and [as] thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.
\[4]And Jonathan said to David, What thy soul may say, I will even do it for thee.
\[5]And David said to Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow is new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field until the third evening.
\[6]If thy father should actually miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city; for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
\[7]If he say thus, It is well,—thy servant shall have peace; but if he be very wroth, be sure that evil is determined by him.
\[8]Deal kindly then with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of Jehovah with thee; but if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?
\[9]And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee; for, if I knew with certainty that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, would I not tell it thee?
\[10]Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?
\[11]And Jonathan said to David, Come and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
\[12]And Jonathan said to David, Jehovah, God of Israel, when I sound my father about this time to-morrow, [or] the next day, and behold, there be good toward David, and I then send not to thee, and apprise thee of it,
\[13]Jehovah do so and much more to Jonathan. Should it please my father [to do] thee evil, then I will apprise thee of it, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace; and Jehovah be with thee, as he has been with my father.
\[14]And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of Jehovah, that I die not,
\[15]but thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever, no, not when Jehovah cuts off the enemies of David, every one from the face of the earth.
\[16]And Jonathan made [a covenant] with the house of David, [saying,] Let Jehovah even require [it] at the hand of David's enemies!
\[17]And Jonathan caused David to swear again, by the love he had for him, for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
\[18]And Jonathan said to him, To-morrow is the new moon; and thou wilt be missed, for thy seat will be empty;
\[19]but on the third day thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself on the day of the business, and abide by the stone Ezel.
\[20]And I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.
\[21]And behold, I will send the lad, [saying,] Go, find the arrows. If I expressly say to the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come, for there is peace for thee, and it is nothing; [as] Jehovah liveth.
\[22]But if I say thus to the youth: Behold, the arrows are beyond thee,—go thy way; for Jehovah sends thee away.
\[23]And as to the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, Jehovah is between me and thee for ever.
\[24]And David hid himself in the field; and it was the new moon, and the king sat at table to eat.
\[25]And the king sat on his seat, as at other times, on the seat by the wall; and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.
\[26]And Saul said nothing that day; for he thought, Something has befallen [him], that he is not clean: surely he is not clean.
\[27]And it came to pass the next day after the new moon, the second [day of the month], as David's place was empty, that Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why has not the son of Jesse come to table, neither yesterday nor to-day?
\[28]And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me [to go] to Bethlehem,
\[29]and said, Let me go, I pray thee; for we have a family sacrifice in the city; and my brother himself has commanded me [to be there]; and now, if I have found favour in thy sight, let me go away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. He has therefore not come to the king's table.
\[30]And Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, Son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame and to the shame of thy mother's nakedness?
\[31]For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. And now send and fetch him to me, for he must die.
\[32]And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why should he be put to death? what has he done?
\[33]Then Saul cast the spear at him to smite him; and Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to put David to death.
\[34]And Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no meat the second day of the new moon; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
\[35]And it came to pass in the morning that Jonathan went out into the field, to the place agreed on with David, and a little lad with him.
\[36]And he said to his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. The lad ran, and he shot the arrow beyond him.
\[37]And when the lad came to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad and said, Is not the arrow away beyond thee?
\[38]And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not! And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
\[39]And the lad knew nothing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
\[40]And Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city.
\[41]The lad went, and David arose from the side of the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times; and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.
\[42]And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have both of us sworn in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever! And he arose and departed; and Jonathan went into the city.

\[2]And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me a business, and has said to me, Let no man know anything of the business whereon I send thee, and what I have commanded thee; and I have directed the young men to such and such a place.
\[3]And now what is under thy hand? give me five loaves in my hand, or what may be found.
\[4]And the priest answered David and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.
\[5]And David answered the priest and said to him, Yes indeed, women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the [bread] is in a manner common, and the more so, because to-day [new] is hallowed in the vessels.
\[6]And the priest gave him holy [bread]; for there was no bread there but the shew-loaves that were taken from before Jehovah, to put on hot bread in the day when they were taken away.
\[7](Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Jehovah; and his name was Doeg, the Edomite, chief of the shepherds that [belonged] to Saul.)
\[8]And David said to Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, for the king's business was urgent.
\[9]And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of terebinths, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that: give it me.
\[10]And David arose, and fled that day from before Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
\[11]And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has smitten his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
\[12]And David took to heart these words, and was much afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
\[13]And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scratched on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.
\[14]And Achish said to his servants, Behold, ye see the man is mad: why did ye bring him to me?
\[15]have I lack of madmen, that ye have brought this one to rave in my presence? shall this [man] come into my house?

\[2]And every one in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one of embittered spirit collected round him; and he became a captain over them; and there were with him about four hundred men.
\[3]And David went thence to Mizpeh in Moab, and said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth amongst you, till I know what God will do for me.
\[4]And he brought them before the king of Moab; and they abode with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.
\[5]And the prophet Gad said to David, Abide not in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.
\[6]And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah under the tamarisk upon the height, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing by him.
\[7]Then Saul said to his servants that stood by him, Hear now, ye Benjaminites: will the son of Jesse give every one of you also fields and vineyards? Will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,
\[8]that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that informs me when my son has made [a covenant] with the son of Jesse; and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or informs me that my son has stirred up my servant as a lier-in-wait against me, as at this day?
\[9]Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
\[10]And he inquired of Jehovah for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
\[11]Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob; and they came all of them to the king.
\[12]And Saul said, Hear now, son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.
\[13]And Saul said to him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me as a lier-in-wait, as at this day?
\[14]And Ahimelech answered the king and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and has access to thy secret council, and is honourable in thy house?
\[15]Was it to-day that I began to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king charge anything to his servant, [nor] to all the house of my father; for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.
\[16]And the king said, Thou shalt certainly die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.
\[17]And the king said to the couriers that stood about him, Turn and put the priests of Jehovah to death; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not inform me. But the servants of the king were not willing to put forth their hand to fall on the priests of Jehovah.
\[18]And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall on the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and fell on the priests, and put to death that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod.
\[19]And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and women, infants and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
\[20]And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.
\[21]And Abiathar informed David that Saul had slain Jehovah's priests.
\[22]And David said to Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would certainly tell Saul: I am accountable for all the lives of thy father's house.

\[3]But David's men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
\[4]And David inquired of Jehovah yet again. And Jehovah answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will give the Philistines into thy hand.
\[5]And David and his men went to Keilah, and fought against the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
\[6]And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, he came down with an ephod in his hand.
\[7]And it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. Then Saul said, God has cast him off into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a city that has gates and bars.
\[8]And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
\[9]And when David knew that Saul devised mischief against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring the ephod.
\[10]Then said David, Jehovah, God of Israel, thy servant hath heard for certain that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
\[11]Will the citizens of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? Jehovah, God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And Jehovah said, He will come down.
\[12]And David said, Will the citizens of Keilah deliver up me and my men into the hand of Saul? And Jehovah said, They will deliver [thee] up.
\[13]Then David and his men, about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, and he forbore to go forth.
\[14]And David abode in the wilderness in strongholds, and abode in the mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not give him into his hand.
\[15]And David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life; and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.
\[16]And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
\[17]And he said to him, Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father will not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next to thee; and that also Saul my father knows.
\[18]And they two made a covenant before Jehovah; and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.
\[19]And the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself with us in strongholds in the wood, on the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the waste?
\[20]And now, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and it will be for us to deliver him up into the king's hand.
\[21]And Saul said, Blessed be ye of Jehovah; for ye have compassion upon me.
\[22]Go, I pray you, make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his track is, who has seen him there; for it is told me that he deals very subtilly.
\[23]And see, and ascertain all the lurking-places where he hides himself, and come ye again to me with sure information, that I may go with you; and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout the thousands of Judah.
\[24]And they arose and went to Ziph before Saul; but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of the waste.
\[25]And Saul and his men went to seek [him]. And they told David; and he came down from the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And Saul heard [that], and he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
\[26]And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain; and David made haste to get away from Saul; and Saul and his men sought to surround David and his men to take them.
\[27]But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste thee and come; for the Philistines have made a raid against the land.
\[28]And Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines; therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth.

\[2]And Saul took three thousand men, chosen out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
\[3]And he came to the sheepfolds by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet; and David and his men were abiding in the recesses of the cave.
\[4]And David's men said to him, Behold the day of which Jehovah said to thee, Behold, I will give thine enemy into thy hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good to thee. And David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe secretly.
\[5]And it came to pass afterwards that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
\[6]And he said to his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing to my master, Jehovah's anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, for he is the anointed of Jehovah.
\[7]And David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on [his] way.
\[8]David also arose afterwards, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king! And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.
\[9]And David said to Saul, Why dost thou listen to words of men, saying, Behold, David seeks thy hurt?
\[10]Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that Jehovah had given thee this day into my hand in the cave; and they bade me kill thee; but [mine eye] spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord, for he is the anointed of Jehovah.
\[11]And see, my father, yes, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand. For in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou liest in wait for my life to take it.
\[12]Jehovah judge between me and thee, and Jehovah avenge me of thee; but my hand shall not be upon thee.
\[13]As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked; but my hand shall not be upon thee.
\[14]After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a single flea.
\[15]Jehovah therefore shall be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and do me justice [in delivering me] out of thy hand.
\[16]And as soon as David had ended speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.
\[17]And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.
\[18]And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me, forasmuch as when Jehovah had delivered me up into thy hand, thou didst not kill me.
\[19]For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore Jehovah reward thee good for that thou hast done to me this day.
\[20]And now behold, I know that thou shalt certainly be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand.
\[21]Swear now therefore to me by Jehovah, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.
\[22]And David swore to Saul. And Saul went home; and David and his men went up to the stronghold.

nd Samuel died; and all Israel were gathered together, and lamented him; and they buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
\[2]And there was a man at Maon, whose business was at Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats; and he was shearing his sheep at Carmel.
\[3]And the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance; but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was a Calebite.
\[4]And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
\[5]Then David sent out ten young men; and David said to the young men, Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name.
\[6]And thus shall ye say: Long life [to thee]! and peace be to thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be to all that thou hast!
\[7]And now I have heard that thou hast shearers; now thy shepherds who were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there aught missed by them, all the while they were in Carmel.
\[8]Ask thy young men, and they will tell thee. Therefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes; for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, what thy hand may find to thy servants, and to thy son David.
\[9]And David's young men came, and spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
\[10]And Nabal answered David's servants and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants now-a-days that break away every man from his master.
\[11]And shall I take my bread, and my water, and my flesh which I have killed for my shearers, and give [it] to men whom I know not whence they are?
\[12]And David's young men turned their way, and went back, and came and reported to him according to all those words.
\[13]And David said to his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword; and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the baggage.
\[14]And one of [Nabal's] young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to bless our master; and he has insulted them.
\[15]And the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we companied with them, when we were in the fields.
\[16]They were a wall to us both by night and day, all the while we were with them feeding the sheep.
\[17]And now know and consider what thou wilt do, for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household; and he is such a son of Belial, that one cannot speak to him.
\[18]And Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two skin-bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched [corn], and a hundred raisin-cakes, and two hundred fig-cakes, and laid them on asses.
\[19]And she said to her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
\[20]And as she was riding on the ass, and coming down by the covert of the hill, behold, David and his men came down opposite to her; and she met them.
\[21]Now David had said, Surely, in vain have I kept all that this [man] had in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that was his; and he has requited me evil for good.
\[22]So and more also do God to the enemies of David, if I leave of all that is his by the morning light any male.
\[23]And when Abigail saw David, she hasted and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
\[24]and fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, [upon] me let the iniquity be; but let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine ears, and hear the words of thy handmaid.
\[25]Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, Nabal; for as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; and I thy handmaid did not see the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
\[26]And now, my lord, [as] Jehovah liveth, and [as] thy soul liveth, seeing Jehovah has restrained thee from coming with bloodshed, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
\[27]And now this blessing which thy bondmaid has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men that follow my lord.
\[28]I pray thee, forgive the transgression of thy handmaid: for Jehovah will certainly make my lord a lasting house; because my lord fights the battles of Jehovah, and evil has not been found in thee all thy days.
\[29]And if a man is risen up to pursue thee and to seek thy life, the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with Jehovah thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out from the hollow of the sling.
\[30]And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah shall do to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning thee, and shall appoint thee ruler over Israel,
\[31]that this shall be no stumbling-block to thee, nor offence of heart for my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. And when Jehovah shall deal well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.
\[32]And David said to Abigail, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me.
\[33]And blessed be thy discernment, and blessed be thou, who hast kept me this day from coming with bloodshed, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.
\[34]But indeed, as Jehovah the God of Israel liveth, who has restrained me from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light any male.
\[35]So David received of her hand what she had brought him, and said to her, Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.
\[36]And Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was drunken to excess; so she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
\[37]And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things; and his heart died within him, and he became [as] a stone.
\[38]And it came to pass in about ten days that Jehovah smote Nabal, and he died.
\[39]And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Jehovah, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil; but Jehovah has returned Nabal's evil upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her as his wife.
\[40]And the servants of David came to Abigail to Carmel, and spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to thee, to take thee as his wife.
\[41]And she arose and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thy handmaid be a bondwoman to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
\[42]And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
\[43]David had also taken Ahinoam of Jizreel; and they became, even both of them, his wives.
\[44]But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.

nd the Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, facing the waste?
\[2]And Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
\[3]And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which faces the waste, by the way side. And David abode in the wilderness; and when he saw that Saul had come after him into the wilderness,
\[4]David sent out spies, and learned that Saul was certainly come.
\[5]And David arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host; and Saul lay within the wagon-defence, and the people were encamped round about him.
\[6]And David spake and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
\[7]And David and Abishai came to the people by night, and behold, Saul lay sleeping within the wagon-defence, and his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay round about him.
\[8]And Abishai said to David, God has delivered thine enemy into thy hand this day; and now let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear, even to the ground once, and I will not do it the second time.
\[9]And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who can stretch forth his hand against Jehovah's anointed, and be guiltless?
\[10]And David said, [As] Jehovah liveth, Jehovah will surely smite him; either his day shall come to die, or he shall descend into battle and perish.
\[11]Jehovah forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against Jehovah's anointed! But now take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water, and let us go.
\[12]And David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's head; and they went away, and no man saw [it], and none knew [it], and none awaked, for they were all asleep; for a deep sleep from Jehovah had fallen upon them.
\[13]And David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off; a great space [being] between them.
\[14]And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?
\[15]And David said to Abner, Art not thou a man? and who is like to thee in Israel? and why hast thou not guarded thy lord the king? for one of the people came in to destroy the king thy lord.
\[16]This thing is not good which thou hast done. As Jehovah liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not guarded your master, Jehovah's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.
\[17]And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.
\[18]And he said, Why does my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?
\[19]And now, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If Jehovah have moved thee against me, let him accept an oblation; but if the sons of men, cursed be they before Jehovah; for they have driven me out this day from adhering to the inheritance of Jehovah, saying, Go, serve other gods.
\[20]And now, let not my blood fall to the earth far from the face of Jehovah; for the king of Israel is come out to seek a single flea, as when they hunt a partridge on the mountains.
\[21]And Saul said, I have sinned: return, my son David; for I will no more do thee harm, because my life was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have acted foolishly, and have erred exceedingly.
\[22]And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear, and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.
\[23]And Jehovah will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for Jehovah gave thee into [my] hand this day, and I would not stretch forth my hand against Jehovah's anointed.
\[24]And behold, as thy life was highly esteemed this day in mine eyes, so let my life be highly esteemed in the eyes of Jehovah, that he may deliver me out of all distress.
\[25]And Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt certainly do [great things], and shalt certainly prevail. And David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

\[2]And David arose and passed over, he and the six hundred men that were with him, to Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
\[3]And David abode with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household; David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jizreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.
\[4]And it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath; and he sought no more for him.
\[5]And David said to Achish, If now I have found favour in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some country-town, that I may abide there; for why should thy servant abide in the royal city with thee?
\[6]And Achish gave him Ziklag that day; therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day.
\[7]And the time that David abode in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months.
\[8]And David and his men went up and made a raid upon the Geshurites, and the Gerzites, and the Amalekites: for those were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, and as far as the land of Egypt.
\[9]And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.
\[10]So Achish said, Have ye not made a raid to-day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.
\[11]And David left neither man nor woman alive, to bring [them] to Gath, for he said, Lest they should tell of us, saying, So did David. And such was his custom as long as he abode in the country of the Philistines.

\[3](Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and they had buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away the necromancers and the soothsayers out of the land.)
\[4]And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.
\[5]And when Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.
\[6]And Saul inquired of Jehovah; but Jehovah did not answer him, either by dreams, or by Urim, or by prophets.
\[7]Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman that has a spirit of Python, that I may go to her and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who has a spirit of Python at En-dor.
\[8]And Saul disguised himself, and put on other garments, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night; and he said, I pray thee, divine to me by the spirit of Python, and bring me [him] up whom I shall name to thee.
\[9]And the woman said to him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul has done, how he has cut off the necromancers and the soothsayers out of the land; and why layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
\[10]And Saul swore unto her by Jehovah, saying, [As] Jehovah liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.
\[11]Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up to thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
\[12]And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? Even thou art Saul.
\[13]And the king said to her, Be not afraid; but what didst thou see? And the woman said to Saul, I saw a god ascending out of the earth.
\[14]And he said to her, What is his form? And she said, An old man comes up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.
\[15]And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul said, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets nor by dreams; therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known to me what I shall do.
\[16]And Samuel said, Why then dost thou inquire of me, seeing Jehovah is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?
\[17]And Jehovah has done for himself as he spoke by me; and Jehovah has rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbour, to David.
\[18]Because thou didst not hearken to the voice of Jehovah, and didst not execute his fierce anger upon Amalek, therefore has Jehovah done this thing to thee this day.
\[19]And Jehovah will also give Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me; the army of Israel also will Jehovah give into the hand of the Philistines.
\[20]And Saul fell straightway his full length on the earth, and was sore afraid because of the words of Samuel; and there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night.
\[21]And the woman came to Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said to him, Behold, thy bondmaid has hearkened to thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened to thy words which thou spokest to me.
\[22]And now, I pray thee, hearken thou also to the voice of thy bondmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thy way.
\[23]But he refused and said, I will not eat. Then his servants, and the woman also, compelled him, and he hearkened to their voice; and he arose from the earth and sat on the bed.
\[24]And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread thereof;
\[25]and she brought it near before Saul, and before his servants, and they ate. And they rose up and went away that night.

And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or these years, and I have found nothing in him since the day of his falling away [to me] to this day?
\[4]But the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, Make the man return, that he may go again to his place where thou hast appointed him, that he go not down with us to the battle, that in the battle he be not an adversary to us; for wherewith should this [fellow] reconcile himself to his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?

\[6]And Achish called David, and said to him, [As] Jehovah liveth, thou art upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the camp is acceptable to me; for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming to me to this day; but thou art not acceptable to the lords.
\[7]And now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.

\[9]And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art acceptable to me, as an angel of God; nevertheless the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.

\[2]and had taken the women captives that were in it; both great and small: they had put none to death, but had carried them off, and went on their way.
\[3]And David and his men came to the city, and behold, it was burnt with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters were taken captives.
\[4]Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
\[5]And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jizreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
\[6]And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him; for the soul of all the people was embittered, every man because of his sons and because of his daughters; but David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God.
\[7]And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, Bring near to me, I pray thee, the ephod. And Abiathar brought the ephod near to David.
\[8]And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he said to him, Pursue; for thou shalt assuredly overtake [them] and shalt certainly recover.
\[9]So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and they came to the torrent Besor; and those that were left stayed behind.
\[10]And David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were too exhausted to go over the torrent Besor.

\[12]and gave him a piece of fig-cake and two raisin-cakes, and he ate, and his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, for three days and three nights.
\[13]And David said to him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.
\[14]We made a raid against the south of the Cherethites, and against what [belongs] to Judah, and against the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
\[15]And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear to me by God, that thou wilt neither put me to death nor deliver me up into the hand of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.
\[16]And he brought him down, and behold, they were spread over the whole land, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
\[17]And David smote them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day; and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels, and fled.
\[18]And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken: and David recovered his two wives.
\[19]And there was nothing missed by them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil nor anything that they had taken: David brought all back.
\[20]And David took all the flocks and the herds, [which] they drove before the other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.
\[21]And David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow David, and whom they had left behind at the torrent Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him; and David drew near to the people and saluted them.
\[22]And all the wicked men, and [men] of Belial, of those that had gone with David, answered and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them [aught] of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead [them] away and depart.
\[23]Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which Jehovah has given us, who has preserved us, and given the troop that came against us into our hand.
\[24]And who will hearken to you in this matter? For as his share is that goes down to the battle, so shall his share be that abides by the baggage: they shall share alike.
\[25]And it was [so] from that day forward; and he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.

\[10]So I stood over him, and put him to death, for I knew that he would not live after his fall; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither to my lord.
\[11]Then David took hold of his garments and rent them; and all the men that were with him [did] likewise.
\[12]And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
\[13]And David said to the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he said, I am the son of an Amalekite stranger.
\[14]And David said to him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah's anointed?
\[15]Then David called one of the young men and said, Draw near, [and] fall on him. And he smote him that he died.
\[16]And David said to him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth has testified against thee, saying, I have slain Jehovah's anointed.
\[17]And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son;
\[18]and he bade them teach the children of Judah [the song of] the bow. Behold, it is written in the book of Jasher:—
\[19]The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
\[20]Tell [it] not in Gath, carry not the tidings in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
\[21]Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, no rain upon you, nor fields of heave-offerings! For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, [as] not anointed with oil.
\[22]From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan turned not back, And the sword of Saul returned not empty.
\[23]Saul and Jonathan, beloved and pleasant in their lives, Even in their death were not divided; They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
\[24]Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet with splendour, Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
\[25]How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain upon thy high places.
\[26]I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant wast thou unto me; Thy love to me was wonderful, passing women's love.
\[27]How are the mighty fallen, and the instruments of war perished!

nd it came to pass after this that David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah? And Jehovah said to him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.
\[2]So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jizreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
\[3]And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household; and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
\[4]And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, It is the men of Jabesh-Gilead that have buried Saul.
\[5]And David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-Gilead, and said to them, Blessed be ye of Jehovah, that ye have shewn this kindness to your lord, to Saul, and have buried him!
\[6]And now Jehovah shew kindness and faithfulness to you; and I also will requite you this good, because ye have done this thing.
\[7]And now let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
\[8]And Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
\[9]and made him king over Gilead, and over the Asshurites, and over Jizreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
\[10]Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. However, the house of Judah followed David.
\[11]And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
\[12]And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
\[13]And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out. And they met together by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, these on the one side of the pool, and those on the other side of the pool.
\[14]And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise and make sport before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
\[15]And they arose and went over by number, twelve for Benjamin, and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
\[16]And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and [thrust] his sword in his fellow's side, and they fell down together. And that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is by Gibeon.
\[17]And the battle that day was very severe; and Abner and the men of Israel were routed before the servants of David.
\[18]And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was swift of foot, as one of the gazelles that are in the field.
\[19]And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from behind Abner.
\[20]Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he said, I am.
\[21]And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside, to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay hold of one of the young men, and take for thyself his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
\[22]And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: why should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?
\[23]But he refused to turn aside; therefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the belly, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place. And it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.
\[24]And Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner; and the sun went down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
\[25]And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of a hill.
\[26]And Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? and how long shall it be ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?
\[27]And Joab said, [As] God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.
\[28]And Joab blew the trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither did they fight any more.
\[29]And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.
\[30]And Joab returned from following Abner, and gathered all the people together; and there lacked of David's servants nineteen men, and Asahel.
\[31]And the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, three hundred and sixty men, who had died.
\[32]And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.

nd the war was long between the house of Saul and the house of David; but David became continually stronger, and the house of Saul became continually weaker.
\[2]And to David were sons born in Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jizreelitess;
\[3]and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maachah, daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
\[4]and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
\[5]and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
\[6]And it came to pass while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.
\[7]And Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And [Ishbosheth] said to Abner, Why hast thou gone in to my father's concubine?
\[8]Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, I who against Judah do shew kindness this day to the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou reproachest me this day with the fault of this woman?
\[9]So do God to Abner, and more also, if, as Jehovah has sworn to David, I do not so to him;
\[10]to translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba!
\[11]And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.
\[12]And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying [also], Make thy covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with thee, to turn all Israel to thee.
\[13]And he said, Well, I will make a covenant with thee; only I require one thing of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.
\[14]And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
\[15]And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from [her] husband, from Phaltiel the son of Laish.
\[16]And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner to him, Go, return. And he returned.
\[17]Now Abner had communicated with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David aforetime to be king over you;
\[18]and now do [it], for Jehovah has spoken of David, saying, By my servant David will I save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
\[19]And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin; and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.
\[20]So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a repast.
\[21]And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy heart desires. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
\[22]And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from an expedition, and brought in a great spoil with them; but Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
\[23]And Joab and all the host that was with him came; and they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away; and he is gone in peace.
\[24]Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came to thee; why is it [that] thou hast sent him away, and he is gone?
\[25]Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.
\[26]And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him again from the well of Sirah; but David did not know it.
\[27]And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him secretly, and smote him there in the belly, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
\[28]And afterwards David heard [it], and he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:
\[29]let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that has an issue, or that is a leper, or that leans on a staff, or that falls by the sword, or that lacks bread!
\[30]So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
\[31]And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your garments, and gird yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier.
\[32]And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
\[33]And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a fool dieth?
\[34]Thy hands were not bound, Nor thy feet put into fetters; As a man falleth before wicked men, Fellest thou! And all the people wept again over him.
\[35]And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread or aught else till the sun be down!
\[36]And all the people remarked it, and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased all the people.
\[37]And all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death.
\[38]And the king said to his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
\[39]And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too hard for me: Jehovah reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness!

nd when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were enfeebled, and all Israel was troubled.
\[2]And Saul's son had two men, captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin; for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.
\[3]And the Beerothites had fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.
\[4]And Jonathan Saul's son had a son that was lame of [his] feet. He was five years old when the news came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jizreel; and his nurse took him up and fled. And it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
\[5]And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went and came in about the heat of the day into the house of Ishbosheth, who was taking his noonday rest.
\[6]And they came thither into the midst of the house, [as though] they would fetch wheat; and they smote him in the belly; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
\[7]They came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him; and they took his head, and went by the way of the plain all night.
\[8]And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David in Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, thine enemy who sought thy life; and Jehovah has given to my lord the king to be avenged this day of Saul and of his seed.
\[9]Then David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, [As] Jehovah liveth, who has redeemed my soul out of all distress,
\[10]when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead! and he was in his own sight a messenger of good, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag—to whom forsooth I should give a reward for his good tidings:
\[11]how much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? and should I not now demand his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
\[12]And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged [them] up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.

hen came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
\[2]Even aforetime, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel; and Jehovah said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.
\[3]And all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah; and they anointed David king over Israel.
\[4]David was thirty years old when he began to reign; he reigned forty years.
\[5]In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.
\[6]And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land; and they spoke to David, saying, Thou shalt not come in hither, but the blind and the lame will drive thee back; as much as to say, David will not come in hither.
\[7]But David took the stronghold of Zion, which is the city of David.
\[8]And David said on that day, Whoever smites the Jebusites and gets up to the watercourse, and the lame and the blind hated of David's soul …! Therefore they say, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
\[9]So David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from the Millo and inward.
\[10]And David became continually greater; and Jehovah the God of hosts was with him.
\[11]And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.
\[12]And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom because of his people Israel.
\[13]And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
\[14]And these are the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
\[15]and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
\[16]and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.
\[17]And the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, and all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard [of it], and went down to the stronghold.
\[18]And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\[19]And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou give them into my hand? And Jehovah said to David, Go up; for I will certainly give the Philistines into thy hand.
\[20]And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said, Jehovah has broken in upon mine enemies before me, as the breaking forth of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
\[21]And they left their images there, and David and his men took them away.
\[22]And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\[23]And David inquired of Jehovah; and he said, Thou shalt not go up; turn round behind them and come upon them opposite the mulberry-trees.
\[24]And it shall be, when thou hearest a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then will Jehovah have gone forth before thee, to smite the army of the Philistines.
\[25]And David did so, as Jehovah had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou comest to Gezer.

nd David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
\[2]And David arose and went with all the people that were with him from Baale-Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God which is called by the name, the name of Jehovah of hosts who sitteth between the cherubim.
\[3]And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was upon the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.
\[4]And they brought it with the ark of God out of the house of Abinadab which was upon the hill; and Ahio went before the ark.
\[5]And David and all the house of Israel played before Jehovah on all manner of [instruments made of] cypress wood, with harps, and with lutes, and with tambours, and with sistra, and with cymbals.
\[6]And when they came to Nachon's threshing-floor, Uzzah reached after the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen had stumbled.
\[7]And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.
\[8]And David was indignant, because Jehovah had made a breach upon Uzzah; and he called that place Perez-Uzzah to this day.
\[9]And David was afraid of Jehovah that day, and said, How shall the ark of Jehovah come to me?
\[10]So David would not bring the ark of Jehovah home unto himself into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
\[11]And the ark of Jehovah remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months; and Jehovah blessed Obed-Edom and all his household.
\[12]And it was told king David, saying, Jehovah has blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that is his, because of the ark of God. And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom into the city of David with joy.
\[13]And it was so, that when they that bore the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatted beast.
\[14]And David danced before Jehovah with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.
\[15]And David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Jehovah with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
\[16]And as the ark of Jehovah came into the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Jehovah; and she despised him in her heart.
\[17]And they brought in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had spread for it. And David offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah.
\[18]And when David had ended offering up the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of hosts.
\[19]And he dealt to all the people, to the whole multitude of Israel, both men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a measure [of wine], and a raisin-cake. And all the people departed every one to his house.
\[20]And David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How honourable did the king of Israel make himself to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the lewd fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!
\[21]And David said to Michal, It was before Jehovah, who chose me rather than thy father, and than all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of Jehovah, over Israel; and I played before Jehovah.
\[22]And I will make myself yet more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight; and of the handmaids that thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.

\[3]And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee.
\[4]And it came to pass that night that the word of Jehovah came to Nathan, saying,
\[5]Go and say to my servant, to David, Thus saith Jehovah: Wilt thou build me a house for me to dwell in?
\[6]For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but I went about in a tent and in a tabernacle.
\[7]In all my going about with all the children of Israel, did I speak a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye me not a house of cedars?
\[8]And now, thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I took thee from the pasture-grounds, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people, over Israel;
\[9]and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are on the earth.
\[10]And I will appoint a place for my people, for Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and be disturbed no more; neither shall the sons of wickedness afflict them any more, as formerly,
\[11]and since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. And I have given thee rest from all thine enemies; and Jehovah telleth thee that Jehovah will make thee a house.
\[12]When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
\[13]It is he who shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
\[14]I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the sons of men;
\[15]but my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before thee.
\[16]And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made firm for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.
\[17]According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.
\[18]And king David went in and sat before Jehovah, and said, Who am I, Lord Jehovah, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
\[19]And yet this hath been a small thing in thy sight, Lord Jehovah; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, Lord Jehovah?
\[20]And what can David say more to thee? for thou, Lord Jehovah, knowest thy servant.
\[21]For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, to make thy servant know [it].
\[22]Wherefore thou art great, Jehovah Elohim; for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
\[23]And who is like thy people, like Israel, the one nation in the earth that God went to redeem to be a people to himself, and to make himself a name, and to do for them great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thyself from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?
\[24]And thou hast established to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, Jehovah, art become their God.
\[25]And now, Jehovah Elohim, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house, fulfil it for ever, and do as thou hast said.
\[26]And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is God over Israel; and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.
\[27]For thou, Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house; therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.
\[28]And now, Lord Jehovah, thou art that God, and thy words are true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant;
\[29]and now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever; for thou, Lord Jehovah, hast spoken it; and with thy blessing shall the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.

\[3]And David smote Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion by the river Euphrates.

\[13]And David made him a name when he returned, after he had smitten the Syrians in the valley of salt, eighteen thousand [men].
\[14]And he put garrisons in Edom: throughout Edom did he put garrisons; and all they of Edom became servants to David. And Jehovah preserved David whithersoever he went.
\[15]And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice to all his people.
\[16]And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was chronicler;
\[17]and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was scribe;
\[18]and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.

\[2]And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba; and they called him to David. And the king said to him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant!
\[3]And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God to him? And Ziba said to the king, Jonathan has yet a son, who is lame on [his] feet.
\[4]And the king said to him, Where is he? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.
\[5]And king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.
\[6]And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face and did obeisance. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he said, Behold thy servant!
\[7]And David said to him, Fear not; for I will certainly shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.
\[8]And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?
\[9]Then the king called Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, I have given to thy master's son all that belonged to Saul and to all his house.
\[10]And thou, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in [the fruits], that thy master's son may have food to eat. And Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread at my table continually. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
\[11]And Ziba said to the king, According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant, so will thy servant do. And Mephibosheth [said David] shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.
\[12]And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all who dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.
\[13]So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for he did eat continually at the king's table. And he was lame on both his feet.

nd it came to pass after this that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
\[2]And David said, I will shew kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
\[3]And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Is it, in thine eyes, to honour thy father that David has sent comforters to thee? Is it not to search the city and to spy it out, and to overthrow it, that David has sent his servants to thee?
\[4]And Hanun took David's servants, and had the one half of their beards shaved off, and their raiment cut off in the midst, as far as their buttocks, and sent them away.
\[5]And they told [it] to David; and he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Abide at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
\[6]And the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David; and the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-Rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah [with] a thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men.
\[7]And David heard [of it], and he sent Joab, and all the host, the mighty men.
\[8]And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate; and the Syrians of Zoba and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the field.
\[9]And Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind; and he chose out of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians;
\[10]and the rest of the people he gave into the hand of Abishai his brother that he might array them against the children of Ammon.
\[11]And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; and if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.
\[12]Be strong, and let us shew ourselves valiant for our people and for the cities of our God; and Jehovah do what is good in his sight.
\[13]And Joab drew near, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians; and they fled before him.
\[14]And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians fled, they fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. And Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
\[15]And when the Syrians saw that they were routed before Israel, they gathered themselves together.
\[16]And Hadarezer sent, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river; and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer [went] before them.
\[17]And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
\[18]And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven hundred [in] chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.
\[19]And all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were routed before Israel, and they made peace with Israel, and served them. And the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.

nd it came to pass, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go forth, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they laid waste the [land of the] children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David abode at Jerusalem.
\[2]And it came to pass at evening time that David arose from off his couch, and walked upon the roof of the king's house; and from the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful;
\[3]and David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Urijah the Hittite?
\[4]And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her; and she had purified herself from her uncleanness; and she returned to her house.
\[5]And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child.
\[6]And David sent to Joab [saying], Send me Urijah the Hittite. And Joab sent Urijah to David.
\[7]And when Urijah had come to him, David asked how Joab prospered, and how the people prospered, and how the war prospered.
\[8]And David said to Urijah, Go down to thy house and wash thy feet. And Urijah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him presents from the king.
\[9]And Urijah slept at the entrance of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
\[10]And they had told David saying, Urijah did not go down to his house; and David said to Urijah, Art thou not come from a journey? why didst thou not go down to thy house?
\[11]And Urijah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields: shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? [As] thou livest, and [as] thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.
\[12]And David said to Urijah, Abide here to-day also, and to-morrow I will let thee depart. And Urijah abode in Jerusalem that day and the morrow.
\[13]And David invited him, and he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk. And in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, but did not go down to his house.
\[14]And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by Urijah.
\[15]And he wrote in the letter saying, Set Urijah in the front of the thickest fight, and withdraw from him, that he may be smitten and die.
\[16]And it came to pass as Joab watched the city, that he assigned Urijah to a place where he knew that the valiant men were.
\[17]And the men of the city went out and fought with Joab; and there fell some of the people, of the servants of David; and Urijah the Hittite died also.
\[18]Then Joab sent and told David all the matters of the war;
\[19]and charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast ended telling the matters of the war to the king,
\[20]and if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say to thee, Why did ye go so near to the city to fight? did ye not know that they would shoot from the wall?
\[21]Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast the upper stone of a handmill from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why did ye go near the wall?—then say thou, Thy servant Urijah the Hittite is dead also.
\[22]And the messenger went; and he came and told David all that Joab had sent him for.
\[23]And the messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us, and came out against us into the field, and we were upon them as far as the entrance of the gate.
\[24]And the shooters shot from upon the wall against thy servants; and some of the king's servants are dead, and thy servant Urijah the Hittite is dead also.
\[25]Then David said to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to Joab: Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devours one as well as another: make thy battle strong against the city, and overthrow it;—and encourage him.
\[26]And the wife of Urijah heard that Urijah her husband was dead, and she mourned for her husband.
\[27]And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done was evil in the sight of Jehovah.

nd Jehovah sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
\[2]The rich had very many flocks and herds;
\[3]but the poor man had nothing at all, but one little ewe lamb which he had bought, and was nourishing; and it grew up with him, and together with his children: it ate of his morsel, and drank of his own cup, and slept in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.
\[4]And there came a traveller to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that had come to him; and he took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that had come to him.
\[5]Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah liveth, the man that hath done this thing is worthy of death;
\[6]and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
\[7]And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man! Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;
\[8]and I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if [that] had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.
\[9]Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah to do evil in his sight? thou hast smitten Urijah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
\[10]Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Urijah the Hittite to be thy wife.
\[11]Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
\[12]For thou didst [it] secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun.
\[13]And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said to David, Jehovah has also put away thy sin: thou shalt not die.
\[14]Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, even the child that is born to thee shall certainly die.
\[15]And Nathan departed to his house. And Jehovah smote the child that Urijah's wife bore to David, and it became very sick.
\[16]And David besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth.
\[17]And the elders of his house arose, [and went] to him, to raise him up from the earth; but he would not, and he ate no bread with them.
\[18]And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not hearken to our voice; and how shall we say to him, The child is dead? he may do some harm.
\[19]But David saw that his servants whispered, and David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
\[20]Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothing, and entered into the house of Jehovah and worshipped; then he came to his own house and required them to set bread before him, and he ate.
\[21]And his servants said to him, What thing is this which thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child alive; but as soon as the child is dead, thou dost rise and eat bread.
\[22]And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I thought, Who knows? [perhaps] Jehovah will be gracious to me, that the child may live.
\[23]But now he is dead, why should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.
\[24]And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her and lay with her; and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon; and Jehovah loved him.
\[25]And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah's sake.
\[26]And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
\[27]And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.
\[28]And now gather the rest of the people, and encamp against the city and take it: lest I take the city and it be called by my name.
\[29]And David gathered all the people, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it and took it.
\[30]And he took the crown of their king from off his head, the weight of which was a talent of gold with [the] precious stones; and it was [set] on David's head; and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
\[31]And he brought out the people that were in it, and put them under the saw, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkilns. And so did he to all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

nd it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David having a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar, Amnon the son of David loved her.
\[2]And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed difficult for Amnon to do the least thing to her.
\[3]And Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother; and Jonadab was a very shrewd man.
\[4]And he said to him, Why dost thou, the king's son, get thinner from morning to morning? Wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
\[5]And Jonadab said to him, Lay thee down on thy bed and feign thyself sick; and when thy father comes to see thee, say to him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me food, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.
\[6]So Amnon lay down and feigned himself sick; and the king came to see him, and Amnon said to the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.
\[7]And David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go, I pray thee, to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him food.
\[8]And Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he had lain down. And she took flour and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.
\[9]And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Put every man out from me. And they went out every man from him.
\[10]And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the dish into the chamber, that I may eat of thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes that she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
\[11]And she presented them to him to eat; and he took hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.
\[12]And she said to him, No, my brother, do not humble me; for no such thing is done in Israel: do not this infamy.
\[13]And I, whither shall I carry my reproach? and thou wouldest be as one of the infamous in Israel. And now, I pray thee, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.
\[14]But he would not hearken to her voice, and was stronger than she, and humbled her and lay with her.
\[15]And Amnon hated her with an exceeding great hatred, for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.
\[16]And she said to him, There is no cause for this evil in sending me away, [which] is greater than the other that thou didst to me. But he would not hearken to her.
\[17]Then he called his young man that attended upon him, and said, Put now this [woman] out from me, and bolt the door after her.
\[18]Now she had a vest of many colours upon her; for so were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. And his attendant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
\[19]And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her vest of many colours which was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went away, crying out as she went.
\[20]And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon thy brother been with thee? and now, my sister, be still: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart. And Tamar remained, and [that] desolate, in her brother Absalom's house.
\[21]And king David heard of all these things, and he was very angry.
\[22]And Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had humbled his sister Tamar.
\[23]And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-Hazor, which is beside Ephraim; and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
\[24]And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold, now, thy servant has sheepshearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.
\[25]And the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to thee. And he urged him, but he would not go; and he blessed him.
\[26]And Absalom said, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with thee?
\[27]But Absalom pressed him; and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
\[28]And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Smite Amnon; then slay him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.
\[29]And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and they rode each upon his mule and fled.
\[30]And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom has smitten all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.
\[31]Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their garments rent.
\[32]And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he humbled his sister Tamar.
\[33]And now let not my lord the king take the thing to heart, to say, All the king's sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.
\[34]And Absalom fled. And the young man that watched lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there came much people from the way behind him, from the hill-side.
\[35]And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.
\[36]And as soon as he had ended speaking, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept; and the king also and all his servants wept very bitterly.
\[37]And Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day.
\[38]Now Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.

\[3]and come to the king, and speak after this manner to him. And Joab put the words into her mouth.
\[4]And the woman of Tekoah spoke to the king, and she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance, and said, Save, O king!
\[5]And the king said to her, What aileth thee? And she said, I am indeed a widow woman, and my husband is dead.
\[6]And thy bondmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other and slew him.
\[7]And behold, the whole family is risen against thy bondmaid, and they say, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may put him to death, for the life of his brother whom he killed; and we will destroy the heir also: so they will quench my coal which is left, and will not leave to my husband a name or remnant on the earth.
\[8]And the king said to the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.
\[9]And the woman of Tekoah said to the king, Upon me, my lord, O king, be the iniquity, and upon my father's house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.
\[10]And the king said, Whoever speaks to thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
\[11]Then she said, I pray thee, let the king remember Jehovah thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they cut off my son. And he said, [As] Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.
\[12]And the woman said, Let thy bondmaid, I pray thee, speak a word to my lord the king. And he said, Speak.
\[13]And the woman said, Why then hast thou thought such a thing against God's people? and the king in saying this thing, is as one guilty, in that the king does not bring back his banished one.
\[14]For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; and God has not taken away his life, but devises means that the banished one be not expelled from him.
\[15]And now that I am come to speak of this thing to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid; and thy bondmaid said, I will now speak to the king; perhaps the king will perform the request of his handmaid.
\[16]For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
\[17]And thy bondmaid said, Let the word of my lord the king now be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad; and Jehovah thy God will be with thee.
\[18]And the king answered and said to the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.
\[19]And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, [As] thy soul liveth, my lord, O king, there is no turning to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king has spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words into the mouth of thy bondmaid:
\[20]in order to turn the appearance of the thing has thy servant Joab done this thing; but my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all that is in the earth.
\[21]And the king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: so go, bring back the young man Absalom.
\[22]And Joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself, and blessed the king; and Joab said, To-day thy servant knows that I have found favour in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has fulfilled the request of his servant.
\[23]And Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
\[24]And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. And Absalom withdrew to his own house, and saw not the king's face.
\[25]But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
\[26]And when he shaved his head (for it was at every year's end that he shaved it, because it was heavy on him, therefore he shaved it), he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.
\[27]And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a beautiful countenance.
\[28]So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and did not see the king's face.
\[29]Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him; and he sent again the second time, but he would not come.
\[30]Then he said to his servants, See, Joab's allotment is near mine and he has barley there: go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the allotment on fire.
\[31]Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to [his] house, and said to him, Why have thy servants set my allotment on fire?
\[32]And Absalom said to Joab, Behold, I sent to thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Why am I come from Geshur? it would have been better for me to be there still. And now let me see the king's face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him slay me.
\[33]And Joab came to the king, and told him. And he called Absalom, and he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.

\[2]And Absalom rose early, and stood beside the way of the gate; and it was so, that when any man who had a controversy had to come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
\[3]And Absalom said to him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man to hear thee [appointed] by the king.
\[4]And Absalom said, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any controversy and cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!
\[5]And it was so, that when any man came near to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
\[6]And in this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment; and Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
\[7]And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said to the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay in Hebron my vow which I have vowed to Jehovah.
\[8]For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode in Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve Jehovah.
\[9]And the king said to him, Go in peace. And he rose up and went to Hebron.
\[10]And Absalom sent emissaries into all the tribes of Israel, saying, When ye hear the sound of the trumpet, ye shall say, Absalom reigns in Hebron.
\[11]And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew nothing.
\[12]And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, from Giloh, while he offered the sacrifices. And the conspiracy gathered strength; and the people increased continually with Absalom.
\[13]And there came one to David who reported saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
\[14]And David said to all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Rise up and let us flee; for we shall not [else] escape from Absalom. Be quick to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
\[15]And the king's servants said to the king, Behold, thy servants [will do] whatever my lord the king shall choose.
\[16]And the king went forth, and all his household after him, and the king left ten women, concubines, to keep the house.
\[17]And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and stayed at the remote house.
\[18]And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed over before the king.
\[19]And the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why dost thou also go with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king; for thou art a foreigner, and besides, thou hast emigrated to the place where thou [dwellest].
\[20]Thou didst come yesterday, and should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I can? Return and take back thy brethren. Mercy and truth be with thee!
\[21]And Ittai answered the king and said, [As] Jehovah liveth, and [as] my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.
\[22]And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.
\[23]And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over; the king also himself passed over the torrent Kidron, and all the people passed over, towards the way of the wilderness.
\[24]And behold, Zadok also, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had passed completely out of the city.
\[25]And the king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city. If I shall find favour in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again, and shew me it, and its habitation.
\[26]But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, [here am] I, let him do to me as seemeth good to him.
\[27]And the king said to Zadok the priest, Thou art the seer: return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
\[28]See, I will stop in the plains of the desert, until there come word from you to inform me.
\[29]And Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem; and they abode there.
\[30]But David went up by the ascent of the Olives, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot; and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
\[31]And one told David saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. Then said David, Jehovah, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
\[32]And it came to pass, when David had come to the summit, where he worshipped God, that behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head.
\[33]And David said to him, If thou passest on with me, thou wilt be a burden to me;
\[34]but if thou return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so now will I be thy servant; then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.
\[35]And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? and it shall be, [that] whatsoever thing thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
\[36]Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's [son], and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send to me everything that ye shall hear.
\[37]And Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.

nd when David was a little past the summit, behold, Ziba, Mephibosheth's servant, met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred [loaves] of bread, and a hundred raisin-cakes, and a hundred cakes of summer fruits, and a flask of wine.
\[2]And the king said to Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruits for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.
\[3]And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.
\[4]And the king said to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained to Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly bow myself: may I find favour in thy sight, my lord, O king.
\[5]And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out from thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed,
\[6]and cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
\[7]And thus said Shimei as he cursed: Away, away, thou man of blood and man of Belial!
\[8]Jehovah has returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and Jehovah has given the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and behold, thou art [taken] in thine own evil, for thou art a man of blood.
\[9]And Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.
\[10]And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, for Jehovah has said to him, Curse David! Who shall then say, Why dost thou so?
\[11]And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth of my bowels, seeks my life: how much more now a Benjaminite? let him alone and let him curse; for Jehovah has bidden him.
\[12]It may be that Jehovah will look on mine affliction, and that Jehovah will requite me good for my being cursed this day.
\[13]And David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
\[14]And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.
\[15]Now Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
\[16]And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, Long live the king! Long live the king!
\[17]And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why didst thou not go with thy friend?
\[18]And Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.
\[19]And again, whom should I serve? should it not be in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.
\[20]And Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.
\[21]And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to thy father's concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art become odious with thy father; and the hands of all that are with thee shall be strong.
\[22]So they spread a tent for Absalom upon the roof; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
\[23]And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had inquired of the word of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.

nd Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me, I pray, choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David to-night;
\[2]and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid; and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only;
\[3]and I will bring back all the people to thee. The man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: all the people shall be in peace.
\[4]And the saying was right in the eyes of Absalom, and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel.
\[5]And Absalom said, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and we will hear also what he says.
\[6]And Hushai came to Absalom, and Absalom spoke to him saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner: shall we carry out his word? If not, speak thou.
\[7]And Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.
\[8]And Hushai said, Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are of exasperated spirit, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
\[9]Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or some such place; and it will come to pass, when some of them fall at the first, whoever heareth it will say, There has been slaughter among the people that follow Absalom,
\[10]and even the valiant man whose heart is as the heart of a lion shall utterly melt; for all Israel knows that thy father is a mighty man, and they that are with him are valiant men.
\[11]But I counsel that all Israel be speedily gathered to thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.
\[12]And we shall come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.
\[13]And if he withdraw into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the torrent, until there be not one small stone found there.
\[14]And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. And Jehovah had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, in order that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom.
\[15]And Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.
\[16]And now send quickly, and tell David saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.
\[17]And Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; and the maid went and told them; and they went and told king David, for they might not be seen to come into the city.
\[18]But a lad saw them, and told Absalom. Then they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man at Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there.
\[19]And the woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn on it; and the thing was not known.
\[20]And Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, and said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, They have gone over the brook of water. And they sought and could not find [them], and returned to Jerusalem.
\[21]And it came to pass after they had departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said to David, Arise and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counselled against you.
\[22]Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan; by the morning light there was not one of them missing that had not gone over the Jordan.
\[23]And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose and went to his house, to his city, and gave charge to his household, and hanged himself, and he died; and he was buried in the sepulchre of his father.
\[24]And David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
\[25]And Absalom set Amasa over the host instead of Joab; which Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Jithra the Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
\[26]And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
\[27]And as soon as David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
\[28]brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched [corn], and beans, and lentils, and parched [pulse],
\[29]and honey, and cream, and sheep, and cheese of kine to David, and to the people that were with him, to eat; for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty in the wilderness.

nd David marshalled the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
\[2]And David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
\[3]But the people said, Thou shalt not go forth, for if we should in any case flee, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us; for *thou* art worth ten thousand of us; and now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.
\[4]And the king said to them, I will do what is good in your sight. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.
\[5]And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, [Deal] gently for my sake with the young man Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
\[6]And the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.
\[7]And the people of Israel were routed before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day: twenty thousand men.
\[8]And the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
\[9]And Absalom found himself in the presence of David's servants. And Absalom was riding upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of the great terebinth, and his head caught in the terebinth, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.
\[10]And a man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in a terebinth.
\[11]And Joab said to the man that told him, And behold, thou sawest [him], and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten silver pieces and a girdle.
\[12]And the man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand silver pieces in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Take care, whoever it be [of you], of the young man Absalom.
\[13]Or I should have acted falsely against mine own life, for there is no matter concealed from the king, and thou wouldest have set thyself against [me].
\[14]Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three spears in his hand, and thrust them into Absalom's body, while he was yet alive in the midst of the terebinth.
\[15]And ten young men that bore Joab's armour surrounded and smote Absalom, and killed him.
\[16]And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab kept back the people.
\[17]And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and raised a very great heap of stones upon him. And all Israel fled every one to his tent.
\[18]Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a monument, which is in the king's dale; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance; and he called the monument after his own name; and it is called unto this day, Absalom's memorial.
\[19]And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, Let me run, I pray, and carry the king the news that Jehovah has avenged him of his enemies.
\[20]And Joab said to him, Thou shalt not be a bearer of news to-day, but thou shalt carry the news another day; but to-day thou shalt carry no news, because the king's son is dead.
\[21]Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what thou hast seen. And the Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.
\[22]And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, Come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Why wilt thou run, my son, seeing that there is no news suited [to thee]?
\[23]—But, come what may, let me run. And he said to him, Run. And Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outstripped the Cushite.
\[24]And David sat between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate, on to the wall, and lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man running alone.
\[25]And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is news in his mouth. And he came on and drew near.
\[26]And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the porter and said, Behold a man running alone. And the king said, He also is a bearer of news.
\[27]And the watchman said, I see the running of the foremost like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man; and comes with good news.
\[28]And Ahimaaz called and said to the king, Peace! And he fell down to the earth on his face before the king, and said, Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who has delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
\[29]And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz said, I saw a great tumult when Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant; but I knew not what it was.
\[30]And the king said, Turn aside [and] stand here. And he turned aside and stood still.
\[31]And behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, Let my lord the king receive good tidings, for Jehovah has avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.
\[32]And the king said to the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And the Cushite said, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee for evil, be as that young man.
\[33]And the king was much moved, and went up to the upper chamber of the gate, and wept; and as he went, he said thus: O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died in thy stead, O Absalom, my son, my son!

nd it was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.
\[2]And the victory that day was [turned] into mourning for all the people; for the people heard say that day, The king is grieved for his son.
\[3]And the people stole away that day into the city, as people steal away when ashamed of fleeing in battle.
\[4]And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, My son Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!
\[5]And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast put to shame this day the faces of all thy servants who have this day saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy concubines;
\[6]in that thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest those that love thee. For thou hast declared this day, that neither princes nor servants are anything to thee: for to-day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died to-day, then it would have been right in thine eyes.
\[7]But now arise, go forth, and speak consolingly to thy servants; for I swear by Jehovah, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night; and that would be worse to thee than all the evil that has befallen thee from thy youth until now.
\[8]Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate. And all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.
\[9]And all the people were at strife throughout the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land because of Absalom.
\[10]And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle; and now why are ye silent as to bringing the king back?
\[11]And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, to his house.
\[12]Ye are my brethren, ye are my bone and my flesh; and why will ye be the last to bring back the king?
\[13]And say to Amasa, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually instead of Joab.
\[14]And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah as of one man; and they sent to the king, Return, thou and all thy servants.
\[15]And the king returned and came as far as the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over the Jordan.
\[16]And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, who was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
\[17]And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they forded the Jordan before the king.
\[18]And a ferry boat passed to and fro to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king as he was [just] crossing over the Jordan.
\[19]And he said to the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity to me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to heart.
\[20]For thy servant knows that I have sinned; and behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.
\[21]And Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Should not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Jehovah's anointed?
\[22]And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries to me? Should there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?
\[23]And the king said to Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king swore to him.
\[24]And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king. Now he had neither washed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came [again] in peace.
\[25]And as soon as Jerusalem came to meet the king, the king said to him, Why didst thou not go with me, Mephibosheth?
\[26]And he said, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for thy servant said, I will saddle me the ass, and ride thereon, and go with the king; for thy servant is lame.
\[27]And he has slandered thy servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God; do therefore what is good in thy sight.
\[28]For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king; and thou didst set thy servant among them that eat at thine own table. What further right therefore have I? and for what should I cry any more to the king?
\[29]And the king said to him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.
\[30]And Mephibosheth said to the king, Let him even take all, since my lord the king is come again in peace to his own house.
\[31]And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.
\[32]And Barzillai was very aged, eighty years old; and it was he that had maintained the king while he abode at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.
\[33]And the king said to Barzillai, Pass thou over with me, and I will maintain thee with me in Jerusalem.
\[34]And Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
\[35]I am this day eighty years old: can I discern between good and bad? can thy servant taste what I eat and what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? and why should thy servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?
\[36]Thy servant will go a little way over the Jordan with the king; and why should the king recompense it to me with this reward?
\[37]Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham: let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what seems good to thee.
\[38]And the king said, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which seems good to thee; and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.
\[39]And all the people went over the Jordan; and the king went over; and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place.
\[40]And the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him; and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.
\[41]And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over the Jordan?
\[42]And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to me; and why then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten anything which came from the king, or has he given us any present?
\[43]And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, I have ten parts in the king and I have also more right in David than thou; and why didst thou slight me? and was not my advice the first, to bring back my king?

nd there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite; and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, Israel.
\[2]Then all the men of Israel went up from after David, following Sheba the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah clave to their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.
\[3]And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women, concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in a house of confinement and maintained them, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.
\[4]And the king said to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and do thou attend here.
\[5]So Amasa went to call together [the men of] Judah; but he delayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
\[6]And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom. Take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities and escape our sight.
\[7]And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
\[8]When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came before them. And Joab was girded with his coat, his dress, and upon it was the girdle of the sword which was fastened on his loins in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell out.
\[9]And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou well, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.
\[10]And Amasa had taken no notice of the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him with it in the belly and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
\[11]And one of Joab's young men stood by [Amasa] and said, He that favours Joab, and he that is for David, let him follow Joab.
\[12]Now Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by stood still.
\[13]When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri,
\[14]who went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth-Maacah, and all the Berim; and they gathered together, and went also after him.
\[15]And they came and besieged him in Abel-Beth-Maacah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it was raised in the trench; and all the people that were with Joab sapped the wall, to throw it down.
\[16]And a wise woman cried out of the city, Hear, hear: say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.
\[17]And he came near to her; and the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he said, I [am he]. And she said to him, Listen to the words of thy handmaid. And he said, I am listening.
\[18]And she spoke saying, They were wont to speak in old time saying, Just inquire in Abel; and so they ended.
\[19]I am peaceable [and] faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?
\[20]And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.
\[21]The matter is not so; but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David: give up him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
\[22]Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
\[23]And Joab was over all the host of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;
\[24]and Adoram was over the levy; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
\[25]and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
\[26]and Ira also, the Jairite, was David's chief ruler.

nd there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of Jehovah. And Jehovah said, It is for Saul, and for [his] house of blood, because he slew the Gibeonites.
\[2]And the king called the Gibeonites, and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remainder of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn to them; and Saul sought to smite them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah.)
\[3]And David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and with what shall I make atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of Jehovah?
\[4]And the Gibeonites said to him, As to Saul and his house, it is with us no question of receiving silver or gold, neither is it for us to have any man put to death in Israel. And he said, What ye say will I do for you.
\[5]And they said to the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in all the borders of Israel,
\[6]let seven men of his sons be given up to us, and we will hang them up to Jehovah in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Jehovah. And the king said, I will give [them].
\[7]But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Jehovah's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
\[8]And the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she had borne to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of [the sister of] Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she had borne to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite;
\[9]and he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill before Jehovah. And they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the first days of the harvest, in the beginning of barley harvest.
\[10]Then Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water poured on them out of the heavens, and suffered neither the fowl of the heavens to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
\[11]And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
\[12]And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-Gilead, who had stolen them from the open place of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, the day the Philistines had smitten Saul in Gilboa;
\[13]and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
\[14]And they buried [them] with the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the sepulchre of Kish his father; and they did all that the king had commanded. And afterwards God was propitious to the land.
\[15]And the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought with the Philistines. And David was exhausted.
\[16]And Ishbibenob, who was of the children of Raphah—the weight of his lance was three hundred shekels of bronze, and he was girded with new [armour]—thought to smite David.
\[17]And Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the lamp of Israel.
\[18]And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines, at Gob; then Sibbechai the Hushathite smote Saph, who was of the children of Raphah.
\[19]And there was again a battle at Gob with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, smote Goliath the Gittite; now the shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam.
\[20]And there was again a battle, at Gath; and there was a man [there] of great stature, that had on each hand six fingers, and on each foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to Raphah.
\[21]And he defied Israel; but Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother smote him.
\[22]These four were born to Raphah, in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

nd David spoke to Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul.
\[2]And he said, Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
\[3]God is my rock, in him will I trust—My shield, and the horn of my salvation, My high tower, and my refuge, My saviour: thou wilt save me from violence.
\[4]I will call upon Jehovah, who is to be praised; So shall I be saved from mine enemies.
\[5]For the waves of death encompassed me, Torrents of Belial made me afraid.
\[6]The bands of Sheol surrounded me; The cords of death encountered me;
\[7]In my distress I called upon Jehovah, And I cried to my God; And he heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry [came] into his ears.
\[8]Then the earth shook, and quaked; The foundations of the heavens trembled And shook because he was wroth.
\[9]There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals burned forth from it.
\[10]And he bowed the heavens, and came down; And darkness was under his feet.
\[11]And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; And he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
\[12]And he made darkness round about him a tent, Gatherings of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
\[13]From the brightness before him Burned forth coals of fire.
\[14]Jehovah thundered from the heavens, And the Most High uttered his voice.
\[15]And he sent arrows, and scattered [mine enemies]; Lightning, and discomfited them.
\[16]And the beds of the sea were seen, The foundations of the world were uncovered At the rebuke of Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
\[17]He reached forth from above, he took me, He drew me out of great waters;
\[18]He delivered me from my strong enemy, From them that hated me; For they were mightier than I.
\[19]They encountered me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay.
\[20]And he brought me forth into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
\[21]Jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
\[22]For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly departed from my God.
\[23]For all his ordinances were before me, And his statutes, I did not depart from them,
\[24]And I was upright before him, And kept myself from mine iniquity.
\[25]And Jehovah hath recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his sight.
\[26]With the gracious thou dost shew thyself gracious; With the upright man thou dost shew thyself upright;
\[27]With the pure thou dost shew thyself pure; And with the perverse thou dost shew thyself contrary.
\[28]And the afflicted people thou dost save; And thine eyes are upon the haughty, [whom] thou bringest down.
\[29]For thou art my lamp, Jehovah; And Jehovah enlighteneth my darkness.
\[30]For by thee I have run through a troop; By my God have I leaped over a wall.
\[31]As for God, his way is perfect; The word of Jehovah is tried: He is a shield to all that trust in him.
\[32]For who is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, save our God?
\[33]God is my strong fortress, And he maketh my way perfectly smooth.
\[34]He maketh my feet like hinds' [feet], And setteth me upon my high places.
\[35]He teacheth my hands to war, And mine arms bend a bow of brass.
\[36]And thou didst give me the shield of thy salvation, And thy condescending gentleness hath made me great.
\[37]Thou enlargedst my steps under me; And mine ankles did not slip.
\[38]I pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them, And I turned not again till they were consumed.
\[39]And I have consumed them and have crushed them, and they rose not again; Yea, they fell under my feet.
\[40]And thou girdedst me with strength to battle: Thou didst subdue under me those that rose up against me.
\[41]And mine enemies didst thou make to turn their backs unto me, And those that hated me I destroyed.
\[42]They looked, and there was none to save—Unto Jehovah, and he answered them not.
\[43]And I did beat them small as the dust of the earth, I trod them as the mire of the streets; I stamped upon them.
\[44]And thou hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, Thou hast kept me to be head of the nations: A people I knew not doth serve me:
\[45]Strangers come cringing unto me: At the hearing of the ear, they obey me.
\[46]Strangers have faded away, And they come trembling forth from their close places.
\[47]Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock; And exalted be the God, the rock of my salvation,
\[48]The God who hath avenged me, And hath brought the peoples under me.
\[49]He brought me forth from mine enemies: Yea, thou hast lifted me up above them that rose up against me; From the man of violence hast thou delivered me.
\[50]Therefore will I give thanks to thee, Jehovah, among the nations, And will sing psalms to thy name.
\[51][It is he] who giveth great deliverances to his king, And sheweth loving-kindness to his anointed, To David, and to his seed for evermore.

ow these are the last words of David: David the son of Jesse saith, And the man who was raised up on high, The anointed of the God of Jacob, And the sweet psalmist of Israel saith,
\[2]The Spirit of Jehovah spoke by me, And his word was on my tongue.
\[3]The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me, The ruler among men shall be just, Ruling in the fear of God;
\[4]And [he shall be] as the light or the morning, [like] the rising of the sun, A morning without clouds; [When] from the sunshine, after rain, The green grass springeth from the earth.
\[5]Although my house be not so before God, Yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, Ordered in every way and sure; For [this is] all my salvation, and every desire, Although he make [it] not to grow.
\[6]But [the sons] of Belial [are] all of them as thorns thrust away, Because they cannot be taken with hands;
\[7]And the man that will touch them provideth himself with iron and the staff of a spear; And they shall be utterly burned with fire in [their] place.
\[8]These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Joseb-Bassebeth, Tachkemonite the chief of the captains: he was Adino the Eznite; he [fought] against eight hundred, slain [by him] at one time.
\[9]And after him, Eleazar the son of Dodo the son of an Ahohite: he was one of the three mighty men with David, when they had defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone up.
\[10]He arose and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave to the sword; and Jehovah wrought a great deliverance that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.
\[11]And after him, Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite: the Philistines were gathered into a troop, and there was there a plot of ground full of lentils, and the people had fled before the Philistines;
\[12]and he stood in the midst of the plot and delivered it, and smote the Philistines, and Jehovah wrought a great deliverance.
\[13]And three of the thirty chiefs went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam, when the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
\[14]And David was then in the stronghold; and the Philistines' garrison was then at Bethlehem.
\[15]And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me to drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate!
\[16]And the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; however he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Jehovah.
\[17]And he said, Be it far from me, Jehovah, that I should do this thing! is it not the blood of the men that went at the risk of their lives? Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
\[18]And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was the chief of three; and he brandished his spear against three hundred and slew them; and he had a name among the three.
\[19]Was he not most honourable of three? and he was their captain; but he did not attain to the [first] three.
\[20]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, son of a valiant man, great in exploits, of Kabzeel: he it was that smote two lions of Moab; and he went down and smote a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.
\[21]He also smote the Egyptian, an imposing man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
\[22]These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he had a name among the three mighty men.
\[23]He was honoured above the thirty, but he did not attain to the [first] three. And David set him in his council.
\[24]Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
\[25]Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
\[26]Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
\[27]Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
\[28]Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
\[29]Heleb the son of Baanah, the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,

nd again the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.
\[2]And the king said to Joab the captain of the host, who was with him, Go, I pray thee, through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and count the people, that I may know the number of the people.
\[3]And Joab said to the king, May Jehovah thy God even add to the people, how many soever they be, a hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see [it]; but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?
\[4]But the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the army. And Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to count the people of Israel.
\[5]And they passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the midst of the ravine of Gad, and toward Jaazer.
\[6]And they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and came to Dan-jaan, and to the environs of Sidon;
\[7]and they came to the fortified city of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites; and went out to the south of Judah, to Beer-sheba.
\[8]And they went through all the land, and came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
\[9]And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to the king; and there were of Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
\[10]And David's heart smote him after he had numbered the people. And David said to Jehovah, I have sinned greatly in what I have done; and now, I beseech thee, Jehovah, put away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
\[11]And when David arose in the morning, the word of Jehovah came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
\[12]Go and say to David, Thus saith Jehovah: I impose on thee three [things]; choose one of them that I may do it unto thee.
\[13]And Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come to thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine adversaries while they pursue thee? or shall there be three days' pestilence in thy land? Now be aware and consider what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.
\[14]And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall, I pray thee, into the hand of Jehovah; for his mercies are great; but let me not fall into the hand of man.
\[15]And Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the set time; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.
\[16]And the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it; but Jehovah repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed among the people, It is enough: withdraw now thine hand. And the angel of Jehovah was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
\[17]And David spoke to Jehovah when he saw the angel that smote among the people, and said, Behold, it is I that have sinned, and it is I that have committed iniquity; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, be on me, and on my father's house!
\[18]And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
\[19]And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as Jehovah had commanded.
\[20]And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on towards him; and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
\[21]And Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor of thee, to build an altar to Jehovah, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
\[22]And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up that which is good in his sight: see, [here are] oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing-sledges and implements of the oxen for wood.
\[23]All these things, O king, doth Araunah give to the king. And Araunah said to the king, Jehovah thy God accept thee.
\[24]And the king said to Araunah, No; but I will in any case buy [them] of thee at a price: neither will I offer up to Jehovah my God burnt-offerings without cost. And David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
\[25]And David built there an altar to Jehovah, and offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. And Jehovah was propitious to the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

\[2]And his servants said to him, Let there be found for my lord the king a young virgin; and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get warm.
\[3]And they sought for a fair damsel throughout the territory of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
\[4]And the damsel was very fair; and cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king knew her not.
\[5]And Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king; and he provided himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
\[6]And his father had not grieved him at any time in saying, Why doest thou so? and he was also a very comely man; and [his mother] bore him after Absalom.
\[7]And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest; and they helped Adonijah and followed [him].
\[8]But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men whom David had, were not with Adonijah.
\[9]And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fatted cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and invited all his brethren, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants;
\[10]but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he did not invite.
\[11]And Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith is king, and David our lord does not know [it]?
\[12]And now, come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
\[13]Go and get thee in to king David, and say to him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear to thy handmaid saying, Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? why then does Adonijah reign?
\[14]Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee and confirm thy words.
\[15]And Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber; and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered to the king.
\[16]And Bathsheba bowed and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?
\[17]And she said to him, My lord, thou hast sworn by Jehovah thy God to thy handmaid, [saying,] Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.
\[18]And now behold, Adonijah is king; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not.
\[19]And he has sacrificed oxen and fatted cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king and Abiathar the priest and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon thy servant has he not invited.
\[20]And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
\[21]Otherwise it shall come to pass when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders.
\[22]And behold, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
\[23]And they told the king saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
\[24]And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?
\[25]For he is gone down this day, and has sacrificed oxen and fatted cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah!
\[26]But me, [even] me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, he has not invited.
\[27]Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewn to thy servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
\[28]Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
\[29]And the king swore, and said, [As] Jehovah liveth, who has redeemed my soul out of all distress,
\[30]even as I swore to thee by Jehovah the God of Israel, saying, Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.
\[31]And Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
\[32]And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
\[33]And the king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon;
\[34]and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, Long live king Solomon!
\[35]And ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit on my throne; for he shall reign in my stead, and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
\[36]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, Amen: Jehovah, the God of my lord the king, say so too.
\[37]As Jehovah has been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
\[38]And Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.
\[39]And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, Long live king Solomon!
\[40]And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
\[41]And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard [it] as they were finishing their repast; and Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, and he said, Wherefore this noise of the city in an uproar?
\[42]While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said [to him], Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good news.
\[43]And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Indeed, our lord king David has made Solomon king.
\[44]And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule;
\[45]and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon; and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise which ye have heard.
\[46]And also Solomon is sitting on the throne of the kingdom.
\[47]And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God make the name of Solomon more excellent than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne! And the king bowed himself on the bed.
\[48]And also thus said the king: Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.
\[49]And all Adonijah's guests were afraid, and rose up and went every man his way.
\[50]And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose and went and caught hold of the horns of the altar.
\[51]And it was told Solomon saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon; for behold, he has caught hold of the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me this day that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.
\[52]And Solomon said, If he be a worthy man, there shall not one of his hairs fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.
\[53]And king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon; and Solomon said to him, Go to thy house.

nd the days of David were at hand that he should die; and he enjoined Solomon his son saying,
\[2]I go the way of all the earth: be of good courage therefore, and be a man;
\[3]and keep the charge of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and whithersoever thou turnest thyself;
\[4]that Jehovah may confirm his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If thy sons take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee, said he, a man upon the throne of Israel.
\[5]And thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and upon his sandals that were on his feet.
\[6]And thou shalt do according to thy wisdom, and not let his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace.
\[7]But shew kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table; for so they came up to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.
\[8]And behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day that I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by Jehovah saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
\[9]And now hold him not guiltless; for thou art a wise man, and thou shalt know what thou oughtest to do to him; but bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood.
\[10]And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
\[11]And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
\[12]And Solomon sat on the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
\[13]And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.
\[14]And he said, I have something to say to thee. And she said, Speak.
\[15]And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had set their faces on me that I should reign; but the kingdom is turned about and is become my brother's, for it was his from Jehovah.
\[16]And now I ask one petition of thee; refuse me not. And she said to him, Speak.
\[17]And he said, Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king—for he will not refuse thee—that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife.
\[18]And Bathsheba said, Well, I will speak for thee to the king.
\[19]And Bathsheba went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne; and he caused a throne to be set for the king's mother, and she sat on his right hand.
\[20]Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; refuse me not. And the king said to her, Ask, my mother, for I will not refuse thee.
\[21]And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother as wife.
\[22]And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
\[23]And king Solomon swore by Jehovah saying, God do so to me, and more also,—Adonijah has spoken this word against his own life!
\[24]And now [as] Jehovah liveth, who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
\[25]And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who fell on him, that he died.
\[26]And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Go to Anathoth, to thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death; but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of Adonai Jehovah before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
\[27]And Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Jehovah, to fulfil the word of Jehovah, which he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
\[28]And the report came to Joab (for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he had not turned after Absalom); and Joab fled to the tent of Jehovah, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.
\[29]And it was told king Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of Jehovah; and behold, he is by the altar. And Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall on him.
\[30]And Benaiah came to the tent of Jehovah and said to him, Thus saith the king: Come forth. And he said, No; for I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
\[31]And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall upon him, and bury him; and take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me and from the house of my father.
\[32]And Jehovah shall requite the blood which he shed upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, without my father David's knowledge: Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
\[33]And their blood shall be requited upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever; but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from Jehovah.
\[34]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell upon him, and put him to death; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
\[35]And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his stead over the host; and Zadok the priest the king put in the stead of Abiathar.
\[36]And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and abide there, and go not forth thence anywhere.
\[37]And it shall be that on the day thou goest forth, and passest over the torrent of Kidron, … know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.
\[38]And Shimei said to the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king has said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
\[39]And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two servants of Shimei's ran away to Achish son of Maachah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.
\[40]Then Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath, to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.
\[41]And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had come again.
\[42]And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make thee swear by Jehovah, and protest to thee, saying, Know for certain, that on the day thou goest forth, and walkest abroad anywhere, thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst to me, The word that I have heard is good.
\[43]Why then hast thou not kept the oath of Jehovah, and the commandment that I charged thee with?
\[44]And the king said to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness of which thy heart is conscious, which thou didst to David my father; and Jehovah returns thy wickedness upon thine own head;
\[45]and king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Jehovah for ever.
\[46]And the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who went out and fell upon him, and he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.

nd Solomon allied himself by marriage with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had ended building his own house, and the house of Jehovah, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
\[2]Only, the people sacrificed on the high places; for there was no house built to the name of Jehovah, until those days.
\[3]And Solomon loved Jehovah, walking in the statutes of David his father; only, he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
\[4]And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer up upon that altar.
\[5]In Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
\[6]And Solomon said, Thou hast shewn unto thy servant David my father great loving-kindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great loving-kindness, that thou hast given him a son who sits upon his throne, as it is this day.
\[7]And now, Jehovah my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father; and I am but a little child: I know not to go out and to come in.
\[8]And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
\[9]Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart, to judge thy people, to discern between good and bad; for who is able to judge this thy numerous people?
\[10]And the word pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
\[11]And God said to him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself discernment to understand judgment;
\[12]behold, I have done according to thy word: behold, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart, so that there hath been none like unto thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
\[13]And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and glory; so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.
\[14]And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will prolong thy days.
\[15]And Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
\[16]Then came two women, harlots, to the king, and stood before him.
\[17]And the first woman said, Ah, my lord! I and this woman abode in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
\[18]And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also; and we were together; no stranger was with us in the house, only we two were in the house.
\[19]And this woman's child died in the night; because she had lain upon it.
\[20]And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead son in my bosom.
\[21]And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; and I considered it in the morning, and behold, it was not my son, whom I bore.
\[22]And the other woman said, No, for the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this one said, No, but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spoke before the king.
\[23]Then said the king, The one says, This that is living is my son, and thy son is the dead; and the other says, No, for thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.
\[24]And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
\[25]And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
\[26]Then spoke the woman whose was the living child to the king, for her bowels yearned over her son, and she said, Ah, my lord! give her the living child, and in no wise put it to death. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine; divide it.
\[27]And the king answered and said, Give this one the living child, and in no wise put it to death: she is its mother.
\[28]And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice.

\[2]And these are the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok was priest;
\[3]Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, chronicler;
\[4]and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
\[5]and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the superintendents; and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, the king's friend;
\[6]and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the levy-service.
\[7]And Solomon had twelve superintendents over all Israel; and they provided food for the king and his household: each man his month in the year had to make provision.
\[8]And these are their names: Ben-Hur, in mount Ephraim.
\[9]Ben-Deker in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-Beth-hanan.
\[10]Ben-Hesed, in Arubboth; he had Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher.
\[11]Ben-Abinadab had all the upland of Dor; Taphath the daughter of Solomon was his wife.
\[12]Baana the son of Ahilud had Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is by Zaretan beneath Jizreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-Meholah, as far as beyond Jokneam.
\[13]Ben-Geber, in Ramoth-Gilead; he had the villages of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; he had the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bars of bronze.
\[14]Ahinadab the son of Iddo, at Mahanaim.
\[15]Ahimaaz, in Nephtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon as wife.
\[16]Baanah the son of Hushai, in Asher and in Aloth.
\[17]Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar.
\[18]Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin.
\[19]Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites, and of Og the king of Bashan; and [he was] the only superintendent that was in the land.
\[20]Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.
\[21]And Solomon ruled over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, and as far as the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
\[22]And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of meal,
\[23]ten fatted oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and gazelles, and fallow-deer, and fatted fowl.
\[24]For he had dominion over all on this side the river, from Tiphsah as far as Gazah, over all the kings on this side the river; and he had peace on all sides round about.
\[25]And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.
\[26]And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
\[27]And those officers provided food for king Solomon, and for all who came to king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they let nothing be wanting.
\[28]And the barley, and the straw for the horses and coursers, they brought to the place where [the superintendents] were, every man according to his charge.
\[29]And God gave Solomon wisdom and very great understanding and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore.

\[31]For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was in all the nations round about.
\[32]And he spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five.
\[33]And he spoke of the trees, from the cedar-tree that is on Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall; he spoke also of cattle, and of fowls, and of creeping things, and of fishes.

nd Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father; for Hiram always loved David.
\[2]And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
\[3]Thou knowest that David my father could not build a house unto the name of Jehovah his God, because of the wars which were about him on every side, until Jehovah put them under the soles of his feet.
\[4]But now Jehovah my God has given me rest on every side: there is neither adversary nor evil event.
\[5]And behold, I purpose to build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God, as Jehovah spoke to David my father saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy stead, he shall build a house unto my name.
\[6]And now command that they hew me cedar-trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants; and I will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say; for thou knowest that there is not among us any that are experienced in cutting timber like to the Zidonians.
\[7]And it came to pass when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be Jehovah this day, who has given to David a wise son over this great people.
\[8]And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard the things which thou sentest to me for: I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of cypress.
\[9]My servants shall bring [them] down from Lebanon to the sea; and I will convey them by sea [in] rafts to the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and thou shalt receive them. And thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for my household.
\[10]So Hiram gave Solomon cedar-trees and cypress-trees [according to] all his desire.
\[11]And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat as food for his household, and twenty measures of beaten oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
\[12]And Jehovah gave Solomon wisdom as he promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league.
\[13]And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
\[14]And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, two months at home; and Adoniram was over the levy.
\[15]And Solomon had seventy thousand that bore burdens, and eighty thousand stone-masons in the mountains;
\[16]besides the overseers whom Solomon had set over the work, three thousand three hundred, who ruled over the people that wrought in the work.
\[17]And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, hewn stones, to lay the foundation of the house.

nd it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of Jehovah.
\[2]And the house that king Solomon built for Jehovah was sixty cubits in length, and twenty in breadth, and thirty cubits in height.
\[3]And the porch, in front of the temple of the house, was twenty cubits in length, in front of the house broadways, [and] ten cubits was its breadth, in front of the house.
\[4]And for the house he made closed windows with fixed lattices.
\[5]And against the wall of the house he built floors round about, [against] the walls of the house, round about the temple and the oracle; and he made side-chambers round about.
\[6]The lowest floor was five cubits broad, and the middle one was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for in the [thickness of the wall of] the house he made resets round about outside, that nothing should be fastened in the walls of the house.
\[7]And the house, when it was being built, was built of stone entirely made ready before it was brought thither; so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was being built.
\[8]The entrance to the side-chambers of the middle [floor] was in the right side of the house; and they went up by winding stairs into the middle [floor], and out of the middle into the third.
\[9]And he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.
\[10]And he built the floors against all the house, five cubits high; and they held to the house by the timbers of cedar.
\[11]And the word of Jehovah came to Solomon saying,
\[12]As to this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and practise mine ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them, then will I perform my word as to thee which I spoke unto David thy father;
\[13]and I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
\[14]And Solomon built the house and finished it.
\[15]And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, from the floor of the house to the walls of the roof; he overlaid [them] on the inside with wood, and overlaid the floor of the house with boards of cypress.
\[16]And he built twenty cubits of the innermost part of the house, both floor and walls, with boards of cedar; and he built [them] for it within, to [be] the oracle, the most holy place.
\[17]And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits [long].
\[18]And the cedar of the house within was carved with colocynths and half-open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
\[19]And he prepared the oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.
\[20]And the oracle within was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof; and he overlaid it with pure gold; and he overlaid the cedar-wood altar—
\[21]and Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold, and shut off the oracle in front with chains of gold, and overlaid it with gold.
\[22]And the whole house he overlaid with gold, the whole house entirely; also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.
\[23]And he made in the oracle two cherubim of olive-wood, ten cubits high;
\[24]and one wing of the cherub was five cubits, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub, ten cubits from the end of one wing to the end of the other wing;
\[25]and the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form.
\[26]The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so of the other cherub.
\[27]And he set the cherubim in the midst of the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched, wing to wing, in the midst of the house.
\[28]And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
\[29]And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved sculptures of cherubim, and palm-trees, and half-open flowers, within and without.
\[30]And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
\[31]And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive-wood: the lintel [and] side posts were the fifth part [of the breadth of the house].
\[32]The two doors were of olive-wood; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim, and palm-trees and half-open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm-trees.
\[33]And he also made for the doorway of the temple posts of olive-wood, of the fourth part [of the breadth of the house].
\[34]And the two folding-doors were of cypress-wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
\[35]And he carved on them cherubim, and palm-trees, and half-open flowers; and overlaid them with gold fitted on the carved work.
\[36]And he built the inner court of three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar-beams.
\[37]In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Jehovah laid, in the month Zif;
\[38]and in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished in all its parts, and according to all the fashion of it. So he was seven years in building it.

nd Solomon was thirteen years building his own house; and he finished all his house.
\[2]And he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length was a hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar-pillars, with cedar-beams upon the pillars;
\[3]and it was covered with cedar above upon the side-chambers, which were on forty-five pillars, fifteen in a row.
\[4]And there were cross-beams in three rows, and window was against window in three ranks.
\[5]And all the doors and posts were square, with an architrave; and window was against window in three ranks.
\[6]And he made the porch of pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits; and there was a porch in front of them; and there were pillars, and steps in front of them.
\[7]And he made the porch for the throne where he judged, the porch of judgment; and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.
\[8]And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. And he made, like to this porch, a house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom Solomon had taken.
\[9]All these [buildings] were of costly stones, hewn stones, according to the measures, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation to the coping, and on the outside as far as the great court.
\[10]And the foundations were of costly stones, great stones, stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits.
\[11]And above were costly stones, hewn stones, according to the measures, and cedar.
\[12]And the great court round about had three rows of hewn stones, and a row of cedar-beams; and so it was for the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and the porch of the house.
\[13]And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
\[14]He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was full of wisdom and understanding and knowledge, to do all kinds of works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and made all his work.
\[15]And he formed the two pillars of brass; the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a line of twelve cubits encompassed the second pillar.
\[16]And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits;
\[17][and] nets of checker-work, wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital.
\[18]And he made pomegranates, namely two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars; and so he did for the other capital.
\[19]And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily-work [as] in the porch, four cubits.
\[20]And the capitals upon the two pillars, above also, close to the enlargement which was behind the network, had two hundred pomegranates in rows round about, [also] on the other capital.
\[21]And he set up the pillars for the porch of the temple; and he set up the right pillar, and called its name Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called its name Boaz.
\[22]And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work; and the work of the pillars was finished.
\[23]And he made the sea, molten, ten cubits from brim to brim, round all about; and its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encompassed it round about.
\[24]And under the brim of it round about there were colocynths, encompassing it, ten in a cubit enclosing the sea round about; two rows of colocynths, cast when it was cast.
\[25]It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
\[26]And its thickness was a hand-breadth, and its brim was like the work of the brim of a cup, with lily-blossoms; it held two thousand baths.
\[27]And he made ten bases of brass: four cubits was the length of one base, and the breadth four cubits, and the height three cubits.
\[28]And the work of the bases was this: they had panels, and the panels were between the fillets.
\[29]And on the panels that were between the fillets were lions, oxen and cherubim; and over the fillets there was a base above; and beneath the lions and oxen were garlands of festoon-work.
\[30]And every base had four wheels of brass, and axles of brass; and on its four corners were shoulder-pieces: under the laver were shoulder-pieces molten, behind every garland.
\[31]And the mouth of it within the crown and above was a cubit; and its mouth was rounded, [as] the work of the base, a cubit and a half; and also upon its mouth was sculpture; but their panels were square, not round.
\[32]And the four wheels were under the panels; and the supports of the wheels were in the base; and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.
\[33]And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their supports, and their rims, and their spokes and their naves were all molten.
\[34]And there were four shoulder-pieces to the four corners of one base; of the base itself were its shoulder-pieces.
\[35]And in the top of the base there was a circular elevation of half a cubit round about; and on the top of the base its stays and its panels were of the same.
\[36]And he engraved on the plates of its stays and on its panels cherubim, lions and palm-trees, according to the space upon each; and garlands were round about.
\[37]After this [manner] he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, one form.
\[38]And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths; every laver was four cubits; upon every one of the ten bases one laver.
\[39]And he put the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house; and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, over against the south.
\[40]And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the bowls. So Hiram ended doing all the work that he made for king Solomon [for] the house of Jehovah:
\[41]two pillars, and the globes of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars, two; and the two networks, to cover the two globes of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;
\[42]and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two globes of the capitals which were upon the pillars;
\[43]and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases;
\[44]and one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;
\[45]and the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls. And all these things, which Hiram made king Solomon for the house of Jehovah, were of bright brass.
\[46]In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay-ground between Succoth and Zaretan.
\[47]And Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed] from their exceeding number; the weight of the brass was not ascertained.
\[48]And Solomon made all the vessels that were [in] the house of Jehovah: the golden altar; and the table of gold, whereon was the shewbread;
\[49]and the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right, and five on the left, before the oracle; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,
\[50]and the basons, and the knives, and the bowls, and the cups, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, for the folding-doors of the inner house, the most holy place, [and] for the doors of the house, of the temple.
\[51]And all the work was finished that king Solomon made for the house of Jehovah. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated; the silver and the gold and the vessels he put among the treasures of the house of Jehovah.

hen Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.
\[2]And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, that is, the seventh month.
\[3]And all the elders of Israel came; and the priests took up the ark.
\[4]And they brought up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent: the priests and the Levites brought them up.
\[5]And king Solomon, and all the assembly of Israel that were assembled to him, [who were] with him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.
\[6]And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim;
\[7]for the cherubim stretched forth [their] wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its staves above.
\[8]And the staves were long, so that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle, but they were not seen without. And there they are to this day.
\[9]There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses placed there at Horeb, when Jehovah made [a covenant] with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
\[10]And it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah,
\[11]and the priests could not stand to do their service because of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of Jehovah.
\[12]Then said Solomon: Jehovah said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
\[13]I have indeed built a house of habitation for thee, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.
\[14]And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel; and the whole congregation of Israel stood.
\[15]And he said: Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,
\[16]Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; but I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
\[17]And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house unto the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
\[18]But Jehovah said to David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart;
\[19]nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.
\[20]And Jehovah has performed his word which he spoke; and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and I have built the house unto the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
\[21]And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
\[22]And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of the whole congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward the heavens.
\[23]And he said, Jehovah, God of Israel! there is no God like thee, in the heavens above, or on the earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart;
\[24]who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him; thou spokest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled [it] with thy hand, as at this day.
\[25]And now, Jehovah, God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy sons take heed to their way, to walk before me as thou hast walked before me.
\[26]And now, O God of Israel, let thy words, I pray thee, be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David my father.
\[27]But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, the heavens, and the heaven of heavens, cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!
\[28]Yet have respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, Jehovah, my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee this day;
\[29]that thine eyes may be open upon this house night and day, upon the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place.
\[30]And hearken unto the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place, and hear thou in thy dwelling-place, in the heavens, and when thou hearest, forgive.
\[31]If a man have sinned against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to adjure him, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;
\[32]then hear thou in the heavens, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, giving him according to his righteousness.
\[33]When thy people Israel are put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house;
\[34]then hear thou in the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land that thou gavest unto their fathers.
\[35]When the heavens are shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, because thou hast afflicted them;
\[36]then hear thou in the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
\[37]If there be famine in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blight, mildew, locust, caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their gates; whatever plague, whatever sickness there be:
\[38]what prayer, what supplication soever be made by any man, of all thy people Israel, when they shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house;
\[39]then hear thou in the heavens, the settled place of thy dwelling, and forgive, and do, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest (for thou, thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men),
\[40]that they may fear thee all the days that they live upon the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.
\[41]And as to the stranger also, who is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake
\[42](for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy mighty hand, and of thy stretched-out arm); when he shall come and pray toward this house,
\[43]hear thou in the heavens thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; in order that all peoples of the earth may know thy name, [and] that they may fear thee as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
\[44]If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray to Jehovah toward the city that thou hast chosen, and the house that I have built unto thy name;
\[45]then hear thou in the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their right.
\[46]If they have sinned against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and give them up to the enemy, and they have carried them away captives unto the enemy's land, far or near;
\[47]and if they shall take it to heart in the land whither they were carried captive, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captive, saying, We have sinned, and have done iniquity, we have dealt perversely;
\[48]and if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies who led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city that thou hast chosen, and the house that I have built unto thy name;
\[49]then hear thou in the heavens, the settled place of thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their right;
\[50]and forgive thy people their sin against thee, and all their transgressions whereby they have transgressed against thee, and give them to find compassion with those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them
\[51](for they are thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron)—
\[52]thine eyes being open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.
\[53]For thou hast separated them from among all peoples of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spokest through Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord Jehovah.
\[54]And it was so, that when Solomon had ended praying all this prayer and supplication to Jehovah, he arose from before the altar of Jehovah, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth to the heavens,
\[55]and he stood and blessed the whole congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
\[56]Blessed be Jehovah, who has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there has not failed one word of all his good promises which he spoke through Moses his servant!
\[57]Jehovah our God be with us, as he was with our fathers; let him not forsake us nor cast us off:
\[58]that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers.
\[59]And let these my words, with which I have made supplication before Jehovah, be nigh to Jehovah our God day and night, that he maintain the right of his servant, and the right of his people Israel, as the matter of each day shall require;
\[60]that all peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah is God, that there is none else;
\[61]and that your heart may be perfect with Jehovah our God, to walk in his statutes and to keep his commandments, as at this day.
\[62]And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifices before Jehovah.
\[63]And Solomon sacrificed a sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he sacrificed to Jehovah, twenty-two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah.
\[64]The same day the king hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offerings, and the oblations, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar that was before Jehovah was too small to receive the burnt-offerings, and the oblations, and the fat of the peace-offerings.
\[65]And at that time Solomon held the feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entrance of Hamath unto the torrent of Egypt, before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven days, fourteen days.
\[66]On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Jehovah had done to David his servant, and to Israel his people.

nd it came to pass when Solomon had completed the building of the house of Jehovah, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,
\[2]that Jehovah appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.
\[3]And Jehovah said to him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication which thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
\[4]And [as for] thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, [and] wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances;
\[5]then will I establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.
\[6][But] if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments, my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them;
\[7]then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and the house, which I have hallowed to my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a by word among all peoples;
\[8]and this house, [which] is high, every one that passes by it shall be astonished at, and shall hiss, and they shall say, Why has Jehovah done thus to this land and to this house?
\[9]And they shall say, Because they forsook Jehovah their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have attached themselves to other gods, and have worshipped them and served them; therefore has Jehovah brought upon them all this evil.
\[10]And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Jehovah and the king's house,
\[11]Hiram the king of Tyre having furnished Solomon with cedar-trees and cypress-trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,—that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
\[12]And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him; and they did not please him.
\[13]And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul to this day.
\[14]And Hiram had sent to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.
\[15]And this is the account of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of Jehovah, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
\[16]—Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer, and burned it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife.
\[17]—And Solomon built Gezer, and lower Beth-horon,
\[18]and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,
\[19]and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and cities for chariots, and cities for the horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and on Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
\[20]All the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel,
\[21]their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, upon them did Solomon impose a tribute of bondservice until this day.
\[22]But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen; but they were men of war, and his servants, and his chiefs, and his captains, and captains of his chariots, and his horsemen.
\[23]These were the chief superintendents that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, that ruled over the people that wrought in the work.
\[24]But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which he had built for her: then he built Millo.
\[25]And three times in the year did Solomon offer up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar that he had built to Jehovah, and he burned incense upon that which was before Jehovah. So he finished the house.
\[26]And king Solomon made a fleet of ships in Ezion-Geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
\[27]And Hiram sent in the fleet his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon;
\[28]and they went to Ophir, and fetched thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.

nd the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon in connection with the name of Jehovah, and came to prove him with enigmas.
\[2]And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices and gold in very great abundance, and precious stones; and she came to Solomon, and spoke to him of all that was in her heart.
\[3]And Solomon explained to her all she spoke of: there was not a thing hidden from the king that he did not explain to her.
\[4]And when the queen of Sheba saw all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,
\[5]and the food of his table, and the deportment of his servants, and the order of service of his attendants, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Jehovah, there was no more spirit in her.
\[6]And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine affairs, and of thy wisdom;
\[7]but I gave no credit to the words, until I came and mine eyes had seen; and behold, the half was not told me: in wisdom and prosperity thou exceedest the report that I heard.
\[8]Happy are thy men! happy are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, who hear thy wisdom!
\[9]Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel! Because Jehovah loves Israel for ever, therefore did he make thee king, to do judgment and justice.
\[10]And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in very great abundance, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as those which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
\[11](And the fleet also of Hiram, which carried gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir sandal-wood in very great abundance, and precious stones.
\[12]And the king made of the sandal-wood a balustrade for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, and harps and lutes for the singers. There came no such sandal-wood, nor was there seen to this day.)
\[13]And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides what he gave her of the bounty of king Solomon. And she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants.
\[14]And the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,
\[15]besides what [came] by the dealers, and by the traffic of the merchants, and by all the kings of Arabia, and by the governors of the country.
\[16]And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold,—he applied six hundred [shekels] of gold to one target;
\[17]and three hundred shields of beaten gold,—he applied three minas of gold to one shield; and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
\[18]And the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with refined gold:
\[19]the throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was rounded behind; and there were arms on each side at the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the arms;
\[20]and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
\[21]And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of precious gold: none were of silver, [which] was not of the least account in the days of Solomon.
\[22]For the king had on the sea a Tarshish-fleet, with the fleet of Hiram: once in three years came the Tarshish-fleet, bringing gold and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
\[23]And king Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
\[24]And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
\[25]And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, and armour, and spices, horses and mules, a rate year by year.
\[26]And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; and he had a thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he placed them in the chariot-cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\[27]And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he as the sycamores that are in the lowland for abundance.
\[28]And the exportation of horses that Solomon had was from Egypt: a caravan of the king's merchants fetched a drove [of horses], at a price.
\[29]And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so they brought [them] by their means, for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Syria.

\[2]of the nations of which Jehovah had said to the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in to you; they would certainly turn away your heart after their gods: to these Solomon was attached in love.
\[3]And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.
\[4]And it came to pass when Solomon was old, [that] his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as the heart of David his father.
\[5]And Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
\[6]And Solomon did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and followed not fully Jehovah, as David his father.
\[7]Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, on the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.
\[8]And so he did for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.
\[9]And Jehovah was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Jehovah the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,
\[10]and had commanded him concerning this thing, not to go after other gods; but he kept not what Jehovah had commanded.
\[11]And Jehovah said to Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done by thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which I commanded thee, I will certainly rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant:
\[12]notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father's sake; I will rend it out of the hand of thy son;
\[13]only, I will not rend away all the kingdom: I will give one tribe to thy son, for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
\[14]And Jehovah stirred up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the king's seed in Edom.
\[15]Now it came to pass when David was in Edom, when Joab the captain of the host had gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom
\[16](for Joab abode there six months with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom),
\[17]that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.
\[18]And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran, and took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt; who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.
\[19]And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, and he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
\[20]And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son; and Tahpenes brought him up in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household, among the sons of Pharaoh.
\[21]And Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead; and Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.
\[22]And Pharaoh said to him, What then dost thou lack with me, that behold, thou desirest to go to thine own country? And he said, Nothing; but in any case let me depart.
\[23]God stirred him up yet an adversary, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from Hadadezer king of Zobah, his lord.
\[24]And he collected men to him, and became captain of a band, when David slew them [of Zobah]; and they went to Damascus, and dwelt there, and reigned in Damascus.
\[25]And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad [did]; and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
\[26]And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zeredah, Solomon's servant (whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman), even he lifted up his hand against the king.
\[27]And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon was building Millo, and closing the breach of the city of David his father;
\[28]and the man Jeroboam was strong and valiant; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.
\[29]And it came to pass at that time that Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, and the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.
\[30]Then Ahijah seized the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces;
\[31]and said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee;
\[32]but one tribe shall he have for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:
\[33]because they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my sight, and my statutes and mine ordinances, as David his father.
\[34]But I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; for I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;
\[35]but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee,—the ten tribes.
\[36]And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen for myself to put my name there.
\[37]And I will take thee, that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth, and thou shalt be king over Israel.
\[38]And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my sight, in keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, that I will be with thee, and build thee a lasting house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.
\[39]And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
\[40]And Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam; and Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt; and he was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
\[41]And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
\[42]And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.

\[3]and they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
\[4]Thy father made our yoke grievous; and now lighten thou the grievous servitude of thy father and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
\[5]And he said to them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.
\[6]And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, How do ye advise to return answer to this people?
\[7]And they spoke to him saying, If this day thou wilt be a servant to this people, and wilt serve them and answer them and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.
\[8]But he forsook the advice of the old men which they had given him, and consulted with the young men, who had grown up with him, that stood before him.
\[9]And he said to them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people who have spoken to me saying, Lighten the yoke which thy father put upon us?
\[10]And the young men that had grown up with him spoke to him saying, Thus shalt thou say to this people that have spoken to thee saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, and lighten thou it for us,—thus shalt thou say to them: My little [finger] is thicker than my father's loins;
\[11]and whereas my father laid a heavy yoke upon you, *I* will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but *I* will chastise you with scorpions.
\[12]And Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed saying, Come again to me on the third day.
\[13]And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the advice of the old men which they had given him;
\[14]and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but *I* will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but *I* will chastise you with scorpions.
\[15]So the king hearkened not to the people; for it was brought about by Jehovah, that he might give effect to his word, which Jehovah spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\[16]And all Israel saw that the king hearkened not to them; and the people answered the king saying, What portion have we in David? And [we have] no inheritance in the son of Jesse: To your tents, O Israel! Now see to thine own house, David! And Israel went to their tents.
\[17]But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
\[18]And king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the levy; but all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. And king Rehoboam hastened to mount his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
\[19]And Israel rebelled against the house of David, unto this day.
\[20]And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come back, that they sent and called him to the assembly, and made him king over all Israel: none followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
\[21]And Rehoboam came to Jerusalem; and he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men apt for war, to fight against the house of Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
\[22]But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
\[23]Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remainder of the people, saying,
\[24]Thus saith Jehovah: Go not up, nor fight with your brethren, the children of Israel; return every man to his house, for this thing is from me. And they hearkened to the word of Jehovah, and returned to depart, according to the word of Jehovah.
\[25]And Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.
\[26]And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David.
\[27]If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, the heart of this people will turn again to their lord, to Rehoboam king of Judah, and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.
\[28]And the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold. And he said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt!
\[29]And he set the one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.
\[30]And this thing became a sin; and the people went [to worship] before the one, as far as Dan.
\[31]And he made a house of high places, and made priests from all classes of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.
\[32]And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that was in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made; and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made.
\[33]And he offered upon the altar that he had made in Bethel, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and he made a feast for the children of Israel, and he offered upon the altar, burning incense.

nd behold, there came a man of God from Judah, by the word of Jehovah, to Bethel; and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.
\[2]And he cried against the altar by the word of Jehovah, and said, O altar, altar! thus saith Jehovah: Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burned upon thee.
\[3]And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign that Jehovah hath spoken: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.
\[4]And it came to pass when the king heard the word of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel, that Jeroboam stretched forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand which he stretched out against him dried up, so that he could not bring it back again to him.
\[5]And the altar was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of Jehovah.
\[6]And the king answered and said to the man of God, Intreat now Jehovah thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me again. And the man of God intreated Jehovah, and the king's hand was restored to him again, and became as before.
\[7]And the king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a present.
\[8]And the man of God said to the king, If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place;
\[9]for so was it charged me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water, nor return by the way that thou shalt go.
\[10]So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he had come to Bethel.
\[11]Now there dwelt a certain old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; the words that he had spoken to the king, them they told also to their father.
\[12]And their father said to them, Which way went he? for his sons had seen which way the man of God went, who came from Judah.
\[13]And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass; and he rode thereon,
\[14]and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under a terebinth; and he said to him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.
\[15]And he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
\[16]And he said, I cannot return with thee, nor go in with thee; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place.
\[17]For it was said to me by the word of Jehovah, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou wentest.
\[18]And he said to him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spoke to me by the word of Jehovah saying, Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water. He lied unto him.
\[19]Then he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.
\[20]And it came to pass as they sat at the table, that the word of Jehovah came to the prophet that brought him back;
\[21]and he cried to the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the word of Jehovah, and hast not kept the commandment that Jehovah thy God commanded thee,
\[22]but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to thee, Eat no bread and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come to the sepulchre of thy fathers.
\[23]And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled the ass for him, for the prophet that he had brought back;
\[24]and he departed. And a lion met him by the way and slew him; and his corpse was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it; the lion also stood by the corpse.
\[25]And behold, men passed by, and saw the corpse cast in the way and the lion standing by the corpse; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
\[26]And the prophet that brought him back from the way heard [of it] and said, It is the man of God who was disobedient to the word of Jehovah; therefore Jehovah has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him and slain him, according to the word of Jehovah which he spoke to him.
\[27]And he spoke to his sons saying, Saddle me the ass; and they saddled it.
\[28]And he went and found his corpse cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the corpse: the lion had not eaten the corpse, nor torn the ass.
\[29]And the prophet took up the corpse of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back; and the old prophet came into the city, to mourn and to bury him.
\[30]And he laid his corpse in his own sepulchre; and they mourned over him [saying], Alas, my brother!
\[31]And it came to pass after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons saying, When I am dead, bury me in the sepulchre in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
\[32]For the word that he cried by the word of Jehovah against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places that are in the cities of Samaria, shall certainly come to pass.
\[33]After this thing Jeroboam turned not from his evil way, but made again from all classes of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became [one] of the priests of the high places.
\[34]And by this thing there was sin on the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.

t that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam was sick.
\[2]And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and go to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who told me that [I should be] king over this people.
\[3]And take with thee ten loaves, and cakes, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he will tell thee what shall become of the lad.
\[4]And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. And Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
\[5]And Jehovah said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee about her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her; for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign to be another.
\[6]And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou to be another? But I am sent to thee with a hard [message].
\[7]Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,
\[8]and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee; and thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do only that which is right in my sight;
\[9]but thou hast done evil above all that were before thee, and hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:
\[10]therefore behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every male, him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.
\[11]Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat, and him that dieth in the field shall the fowl of the heavens eat; for Jehovah hath spoken.
\[12]And thou, arise, go to thine own house; when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
\[13]And all Israel shall mourn for him, and they shall bury him; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found something good toward Jehovah the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.
\[14]And Jehovah shall raise up for himself a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day; and what? … even now.
\[15]And Jehovah will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their Asherahs, provoking Jehovah to anger.
\[16]And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, wherewith he has sinned, and made Israel to sin.
\[17]And Jeroboam's wife arose and departed, and came to Tirzah; when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died.
\[18]And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spoke through his servant Ahijah the prophet.
\[19]And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
\[20]And the days that Jeroboam reigned were twenty-two years; and he slept with his fathers. And Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
\[21]And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there; and his mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.
\[22]And Judah did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed more than all that their fathers had done.
\[23]And they also built for themselves high places, and columns, and Asherahs on every high hill and under every green tree;
\[24]and there were also sodomites in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed before the children of Israel.
\[25]And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, [that] Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.
\[26]And he took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all; and he took away all the shields of gold that Solomon had made.
\[27]And king Rehoboam made in their stead brazen shields, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the couriers who kept the entrance of the king's house.
\[28]And it was so, that as often as the king entered into the house of Jehovah, the couriers bore them, and brought them again into the chamber of the couriers.
\[29]And the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[30]And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all [their] days.

\[2]He reigned three years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Maachah, a daughter of Abishalom.
\[3]And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as the heart of David his father.
\[4]But for David's sake Jehovah his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, setting up his son after him, and establishing Jerusalem;
\[5]because David did that which was right in the sight of Jehovah, and turned not aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Urijah the Hittite.
\[6]And there had been war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
\[7]And the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
\[8]And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his stead.
\[9]And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah;
\[10]and he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Maachah, daughter of Abishalom.
\[11]And Asa did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, as David his father.
\[12]And he put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his father had made.
\[13]And also Maachah his mother he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol for the Asherah; and Asa cut down her idol, and burned it in the valley of Kidron.
\[14]But the high places were not removed; only, Asa's heart was perfect with Jehovah all his days.
\[15]And he brought into the house of Jehovah the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which he himself had dedicated, silver and gold and vessels.
\[16]And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
\[17]And Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, in order to let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
\[18]And Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king's house, and gave them into the hand of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben-Hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who dwelt at Damascus, saying,
\[19]There is a league between me and thee, [as] between my father and thy father; behold, I send thee a present of silver and gold: go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
\[20]And Ben-Hadad hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his forces against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-Beth-Maachah, and all Kinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
\[21]And it came to pass when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
\[22]And king Asa called together all Judah: none was exempted; and they carried away the stones and the timber from Ramah, with which Baasha had been building; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
\[23]And the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Only, in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
\[24]And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father. And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.

\[26]And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made Israel sin.
\[27]And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which [belonged] to the Philistines, when Nadab and all Israel were besieging Gibbethon.
\[28]And Baasha slew him in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
\[29]And it came to pass when he was king, he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left to Jeroboam none that breathed; until he had destroyed him, according to the word of Jehovah which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite,
\[30]because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and wherewith he made Israel to sin; by his provocation with which he provoked Jehovah the God of Israel to anger.

\[3]behold, I will take away Baasha and his house, and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

\[8]In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah for two years.
\[9]And his servant Zimri, captain of half [his] chariots, conspired against him; and he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was the steward of his house in Tirzah;

\[16]And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri has conspired, and has also smitten the king; and all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.
\[17]And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
\[18]And it came to pass when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the citadel of the king's house, and burned the king's house over him with fire;
\[19]and he died for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of Jehovah, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, making Israel to sin.

\[24]And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and built on the hill, and called the name of the city that he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.

\[2]And the word of Jehovah came to him saying,
\[3]Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the torrent Cherith, which is before the Jordan.
\[4]And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the torrent; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.
\[5]And he went and did according to the word of Jehovah; he went and abode by the torrent Cherith, which is before the Jordan.
\[6]And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the torrent.
\[7]And it came to pass after a while that the torrent dried up, for there had been no rain in the land.
\[8]And the word of Jehovah came to him saying,
\[9]Arise, go to Zarephath, which is by Zidon, and abide there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to maintain thee.
\[10]And he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the entrance of the city, behold, a widow woman was there gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
\[11]And she went to fetch [it], and he called to her and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.
\[12]And she said, As Jehovah thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse; and behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
\[13]And Elijah said to her, Fear not; go, do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a little cake first; and bring it to me; and afterwards make for thee and for thy son.
\[14]For thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: The meal in the barrel shall not waste, neither shall the oil in the cruse fail, until the day that Jehovah sendeth rain upon the face of the earth!
\[15]And she went and did according to the word of Elijah; and she, and he, and her house, ate a whole year.
\[16]The meal in the barrel did not waste, neither did the oil in the cruse fail, according to the word of Jehovah which he had spoken through Elijah.
\[17]And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him.
\[18]And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come to me to call mine iniquity to remembrance, and to slay my son?
\[19]And he said to her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the upper chamber where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
\[20]And he cried to Jehovah and said, Jehovah, my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
\[21]And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried to Jehovah and said, Jehovah, my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again!
\[22]And Jehovah heard the voice of Elijah, and the soul of the child came into him again, and he lived.
\[23]And Elijah took the child, and brought him down from the upper chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother; and Elijah said, See, thy son lives.
\[24]And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of Jehovah in thy mouth is truth.

nd it came to pass after many days, that the word of Jehovah came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself to Ahab; and I will send rain upon the face of the earth.
\[2]And Elijah went to shew himself to Ahab. And the famine was severe in Samaria.
\[3]And Ahab called Obadiah, who was the steward of his house (now Obadiah feared Jehovah greatly;
\[4]and it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Jehovah, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and maintained them with bread and water);
\[5]and Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through the land, to all the fountains of water and to all the torrents, perhaps we may find grass to save the horses and the mules alive, so that we may not have to destroy some of [our] beasts.
\[6]And they divided the land between them to pass through it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
\[7]And as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him; and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it indeed thou, my lord Elijah?
\[8]And he said to him, I [am he]: go, say to thy lord, Behold Elijah!
\[9]And he said, What have I sinned, that thou givest thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to put me to death?
\[10]As Jehovah thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord has not sent to seek thee; and when they said, He is not [here], he took an oath of the kingdom or nation that they found thee not.
\[11]And now thou sayest, Go, say to thy lord, Behold Elijah!
\[12]And it shall come to pass when I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of Jehovah shall carry thee whither I know not; and when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will kill me; and I thy servant fear Jehovah from my youth.
\[13]Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of Jehovah, how I hid a hundred men of Jehovah's prophets by fifty in a cave, and maintained them with bread and water?
\[14]And now thou sayest, Go, say to thy lord, Behold Elijah! and he will kill me.
\[15]And Elijah said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will certainly shew myself to him to-day.
\[16]Then Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him. And Ahab went to meet Elijah.
\[17]And it came to pass when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Is it thou, the troubler of Israel?
\[18]And he said, I have not troubled Israel, but thou and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of Jehovah, and thou hast followed the Baals.
\[19]And now send, gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred, who eat at Jezebel's table.
\[20]So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.
\[21]Then Elijah drew near to all the people, and said, How long do ye halt between two opinions? if Jehovah be God, follow him; and if Baal, follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
\[22]And Elijah said to the people, I, only I, remain a prophet of Jehovah; and Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.
\[23]Let them therefore give us two bullocks: and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and put it on the wood, and put no fire; and I will sacrifice the other bullock, and put it on the wood, and put no fire.
\[24]And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of Jehovah; and the god that answers by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, The word is good.
\[25]And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose one bullock for yourselves, and sacrifice it first; for ye are the many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire.
\[26]And they took the bullock which had been given them, and sacrificed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, O Baal, answer us! But there was no voice, and none answered. And they leaped about the altar that had been made.
\[27]And it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said, Cry aloud; for he is a god; for he is meditating, or gone aside, or he is on a journey; perhaps he sleeps, and will awake.
\[28]And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with swords and spears, till the blood gushed out upon them.
\[29]And it came to pass when midday was past, that they prophesied until the [time] of the offering up of the oblation; but there was neither voice, nor any that answered, nor any attention.
\[30]Then Elijah said to all the people, Draw near to me. And all the people drew near to him. And he repaired the altar of Jehovah which was broken down.
\[31]And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of Jehovah came saying, Israel shall be thy name;
\[32]and with the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah, and made a trench round about the altar, of the capacity of two measures of seed;
\[33]and he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood. And he said, Fill four pitchers with water, and pour it on the burnt-offering, and on the wood.
\[34]And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.
\[35]And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
\[36]And it came to pass at [the time of] the offering up of the oblation, that Elijah the prophet drew near, and said, Jehovah, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things by thy word.
\[37]Answer me, Jehovah, answer me, that this people may know that thou Jehovah art God, and [that] *thou* hast turned their heart back again.
\[38]And the fire of Jehovah fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
\[39]And all the people saw [it], and they fell on their faces and said, Jehovah, he is God! Jehovah, he is God!
\[40]And Elijah said to them, Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape! And they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the torrent of Kishon, and slaughtered them there.
\[41]And Elijah said to Ahab, Go up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.
\[42]And Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed down on the earth, and put his face between his knees.
\[43]And he said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up and looked, and said, [There is] nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.
\[44]And it came to pass at the seventh time that he said, Behold there is a cloud, small as a man's hand, arising out of the sea. And he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Harness and go down, that the pour of rain stop thee not.
\[45]And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heavens became black [with] clouds and wind, and there was a great pour of rain. And Ahab got on the chariot, and went to Jizreel.
\[46]And the hand of Jehovah was upon Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jizreel.

nd Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and in detail how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
\[2]And Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah saying, So do the gods [to me], and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time!
\[3]And when he saw [that], he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.
\[4]And he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a certain broom-bush, and requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough: now, Jehovah, take my life; for I am not better than my fathers.
\[5]And he lay down and slept under the broom-bush. And behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise, eat!
\[6]And he looked, and behold, at his head was a cake, baked on hot stones, and a cruse of water. And he ate and drank, and lay down again.
\[7]And the angel of Jehovah came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise, eat; for the journey is too great for thee.
\[8]And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.
\[9]And there he went into a cave, and lodged there. And behold, the word of Jehovah [came] to him, and he said to him, What doest thou here, Elijah?
\[10]And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I am left, I alone, and they seek my life, to take it away.
\[11]And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before Jehovah. And behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before Jehovah: Jehovah was not in the wind. And after the wind, an earthquake: Jehovah was not in the earthquake.
\[12]And after the earthquake, a fire: Jehovah was not in the fire. And after the fire, a soft gentle voice.
\[13]And it came to pass, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice [came] to him and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?
\[14]And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I am left, I alone, and they seek my life, to take it away.
\[15]And Jehovah said to him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus; and when thou comest, anoint Hazael king over Syria;
\[16]and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint prophet in thy stead.
\[17]And it shall come to pass, [that] him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay; and him that escapeth the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.
\[18]Yet I have left [myself] seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth that hath not kissed him.
\[19]And he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was ploughing [with] twelve yokes before him, and he with the twelfth; and Elijah went over to him, and cast his mantle on him.
\[20]And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and I will follow thee. And he said to him, Go back again; for what have I done to thee?
\[21]And he returned back from him, and took the yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled their flesh with the implements of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. And he arose and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.

nd Ben-Hadad king of Syria assembled all his host; and there were thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.
\[2]And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said to him, Thus says Ben-Hadad:
\[3]Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, the goodliest, are mine.
\[4]And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.
\[5]And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaks Ben-Hadad saying: I sent to thee indeed, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;
\[6]but to-morrow about this time I will send my servants to thee, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thy sight, they shall put in their hand and take away.
\[7]And the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this [man] seeks mischief; for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.
\[8]And all the elders and all the people said to him, Hearken not, nor consent.
\[9]And he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do; but this thing I cannot do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.
\[10]And Ben-Hadad sent to him and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me!
\[11]And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell [him], Let not him that girdeth on boast himself as he that putteth off!
\[12]And it came to pass when he heard this word, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the tents, that he said to his servants, Set yourselves. And they set themselves against the city.
\[13]And behold, a prophet drew near to Ahab king of Israel, and said, Thus saith Jehovah: Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.
\[14]And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith Jehovah: By the servants of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? And he said, Thou.
\[15]And he numbered the servants of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he numbered all the people, all the children of Israel, seven thousand.
\[16]And they went out at noon; and Ben-Hadad drank himself drunk in the tents, he and the kings, the thirty-two kings that helped him.
\[17]And the servants of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-Hadad sent out, and they told him saying, There are men come out of Samaria.
\[18]And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.
\[19]And these servants of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army that followed them.
\[20]And they slew every one his man; and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them; and Ben-Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen.
\[21]And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
\[22]And the prophet drew near to the king of Israel, and said to him, Go, strengthen thyself, and understand, and see what thou shalt do; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.
\[23]And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their gods are gods of the mountains; therefore they were stronger than we; but if we fight against them on the plateau, shall we not be stronger than they?
\[24]And do this: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put governors in their stead;
\[25]and number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against them on the plateau: shall we not be stronger than they? And he hearkened to their voice, and did so.
\[26]And it came to pass, at the return of the year, that Ben-Hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
\[27]And the children of Israel were numbered and victualled, and they went against them; and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats; but the Syrians filled the land.
\[28]And the man of God drew near, and spoke to the king of Israel and said, Thus saith Jehovah: Because the Syrians have said, Jehovah is a god of the mountains, but he is not a god of the valleys, I will give all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[29]And they encamped one over against the other seven days; and it came to pass that on the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel smote of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day.
\[30]And the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men of them that were left. And Ben-Hadad fled, and came into the city, [from] chamber to chamber.
\[31]And his servants said to him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will save thy life.
\[32]And they girded sackcloth on their loins, and ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-Hadad says, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.
\[33]And the men took it as a good omen, and hastened to catch what came from him, and they said, Thy brother Ben-Hadad. … And he said, Go, bring him. And Ben-Hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
\[34]And [Ben-Hadad] said to him, The cities that my father took from thy father I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thyself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. And I [said Ahab] will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.
\[35]And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to another by the word of Jehovah, Smite me, I pray thee. But the man refused to smite him.
\[36]Then said he to him, Because thou hast not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, behold, when thou departest from me, the lion will slay thee. And when he had departed from him, the lion found him and slew him.
\[37]Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him violently, and wounded [him].
\[38]And the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with a sash over his eyes.
\[39]And as the king passed by, he cried to the king and said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me and said, Keep this man; if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
\[40]And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, So [is] thy judgment: thyself hast decided [it].
\[41]Then he hastily took the sash away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him, that he was of the prophets.
\[42]And he said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man that I had devoted to destruction, thy life shall be for his life, and thy people for his people.

nd it came to pass after these things, [that] Naboth the Jizreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jizreel, by the side of the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
\[2]And Ahab spoke to Naboth saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, for it is near, by the side of my house; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; if it seem good to thee, I will give thee its value in money.
\[3]And Naboth said to Ahab, Jehovah forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to thee!
\[4]And Ahab came into his house sullen and vexed because of the word that Naboth the Jizreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he lay down on his bed, and turned away his face, and ate no bread.
\[5]And Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is thy spirit sullen, and thou eatest no bread?
\[6]And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jizreelite and said to him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee a vineyard for it; and he said, I will not give thee my vineyard.
\[7]And Jezebel his wife said to him, Dost thou now exercise sovereignty over Israel? arise, eat bread, and let thy heart be glad: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jizreelite.
\[8]And she wrote a letter in Ahab's name, and sealed it with his seal, and sent the letter to the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.
\[9]And she wrote in the letter saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people;
\[10]and set two men, sons of Belial, before him, and they shall bear witness against him saying, Thou didst curse God and the king; and carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.
\[11]And the men of his city, the elders and the nobles that dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, as it was written in the letter that she had sent to them:
\[12]they proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people.
\[13]And there came the two men, sons of Belial, and sat before him; and the men of Belial witnessed against him, against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth blasphemed God and the king. And they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.
\[14]And they sent to Jezebel saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
\[15]And it came to pass when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jizreelite, which he refused to give thee for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
\[16]And it came to pass when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jizreelite, to take possession of it.
\[17]And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
\[18]Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession of it.
\[19]And thou shalt speak unto him saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him saying, Thus saith Jehovah: In the place where the dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall the dogs lick thy blood, even thine.
\[20]And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, mine enemy? And he said, I have found [thee]; because thou hast sold thyself to do evil in the sight of Jehovah.
\[21]Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab every male, and him that is shut up and left in Israel;
\[22]and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.
\[23]And of Jezebel also spoke Jehovah saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the moat of Jizreel.
\[24]Him that dieth of Ahab in the city shall the dogs eat, and him that dieth in the field shall the fowl of the heavens eat.
\[25](Surely there was none like to Ahab, who did sell himself to do evil in the sight of Jehovah, Jezebel his wife urging him on.
\[26]And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Jehovah had dispossessed before the children of Israel.)
\[27]And it came to pass when Ahab heard these words, that he rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
\[28]And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
\[29]Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.

\[3]And the king of Israel said to his servants, Do ye know that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we keep quiet without taking it out of the hand of the king of Syria?
\[4]And he said to Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-Gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
\[5]And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, this day of the word of Jehovah.
\[6]And the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, and the Lord will give it into the king's hand.
\[7]But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we might inquire of him?
\[8]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah; but I hate him, for he prophesies no good concerning me, but evil: [it is] Micah the son of Imlah. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
\[9]Then the king of Israel called a chamberlain, and said, Fetch quickly Micah the son of Imlah.
\[10]And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, having put on their robes, sat each on his throne, in the open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
\[11]And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron, and he said, Thus saith Jehovah: With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have exterminated them.
\[12]And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-Gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will give it into the king's hand.
\[13]And the messenger that went to call Micah spoke to him saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one assent: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak good.
\[14]And Micah said, As Jehovah liveth, even what Jehovah shall say to me, that will I speak.
\[15]And he came to the king. And the king said to him, Micah, shall we go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he said to him, Go up, and prosper; for Jehovah will give it into the hand of the king.
\[16]And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but truth in the name of Jehovah?
\[17]And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And Jehovah said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.
\[18]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he prophesies no good concerning me, but evil?
\[19]And he said, Hear therefore the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him, on his right hand and on his left;
\[20]and Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead? And one said after this manner, and another said after that manner.
\[21]And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him.
\[22]And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice [him], and also succeed: go forth, and do so.
\[23]And now, behold, Jehovah has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and Jehovah has spoken evil concerning thee.
\[24]Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micah upon the cheek, and said, Where now went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak to thee?
\[25]And Micah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go from chamber to chamber to hide thyself.
\[26]And the king of Israel said, Take Micah and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
\[27]and thou shalt say, Thus says the king: Put this [man] in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.
\[28]And Micah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah has not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O peoples, all of you!
\[29]And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-Gilead.
\[30]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
\[31]And the king of Syria commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots saying, Fight neither with small nor great, but with the king of Israel only.
\[32]And it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely that is the king of Israel; and they turned against him to fight; and Jehoshaphat cried out.
\[33]And it came to pass that when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
\[34]And a man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the fastenings and the corslet. And he said to his charioteer, Turn thy hand, and drive me out of the camp; for I am wounded.
\[35]And the battle increased that day; and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and he died at even; and the blood of the wound ran out into the hollow of the chariot.
\[36]And there went the cry throughout the host at the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country!
\[37]And the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.
\[38]And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked his blood, where the harlots bathed: according to the word of Jehovah, which he had spoken.
\[39]And the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house that he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[40]And Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
\[41]And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
\[42]Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
\[43]And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of Jehovah. Only, the high places were not removed: the people offered and burned incense still on the high places.
\[44]And Jehoshaphat was at peace with the king of Israel.
\[45]And the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might which he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[46]And the remainder of the sodomites, which were left in the days of his father Asa, he put away from out of the land.
\[47]And there was no king in Edom: a deputy reigned.
\[48]Jehoshaphat made Tarshish-ships to go to Ophir for gold; but they went not, for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.
\[49]Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
\[50]And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
\[51]Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; and he reigned two years over Israel.
\[52]And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
\[53]And he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked Jehovah the God of Israel to anger, according to all that his father had done.

nd Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
\[2]And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber which was in Samaria, and was sick; and he sent messengers and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this disease.
\[3]And the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?
\[4]Now therefore thus saith Jehovah: Thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt certainly die. And Elijah departed.
\[5]And the messengers returned to him; and he said to them, Why have ye returned?
\[6]And they said unto him, A man came up to meet us, and said to us, Go, return to the king that sent you and say to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt certainly die.
\[7]And he said to them, What manner of man was he that came up to meet you, and told you these words?
\[8]And they said to him, He was a man in a hairy [garment], and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
\[9]And he sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him, and behold, he sat on the top of the mount. And he spoke to him: Man of God, the king says, Come down!
\[10]And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, And if I be a man of God, let fire come down from the heavens and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from the heavens, and consumed him and his fifty.
\[11]And again he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he spoke and said to him, Man of God, thus says the king: Come down quickly!
\[12]And Elijah answered and said to them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from the heavens and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from the heavens, and consumed him and his fifty.
\[13]And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him and said to him, Man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.
\[14]Behold, there came down fire from the heavens, and consumed the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties; but now, let my life be precious in thy sight.
\[15]And the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king.
\[16]And he said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt certainly die.
\[17]And he died according to the word of Jehovah that Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead, in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; for he had no son.
\[18]And the rest of the acts of Ahaziah, what he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

\[2]And Elijah said to Elisha, Abide here, I pray thee; for Jehovah has sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! So they went down to Bethel.
\[3]And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Dost thou know that Jehovah will take away thy master from over thy head to-day? And he said, I also know it: be silent!
\[4]And Elijah said to him, Elisha, abide here, I pray thee; for Jehovah has sent me to Jericho. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! And they came to Jericho.
\[5]And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho drew near to Elisha and said to him, Dost thou know that Jehovah will take away thy master from over thy head to-day? And he said, I also know it: be silent!
\[6]And Elijah said to him, Abide here, I pray thee; for Jehovah has sent me to the Jordan. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! And they two went on.
\[7]And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite afar off; and they two stood by the Jordan.
\[8]And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither; and they two went over on dry ground.
\[9]And it came to pass when they had gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
\[10]And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not, it shall not be [so].
\[11]And it came to pass as they went on, and talked, that behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire; and they parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into the heavens.
\[12]And Elisha saw [it], and he cried, My father, my father! the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof! And he saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own garments and rent them in two pieces.
\[13]And he took up the mantle of Elijah which fell from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan;
\[14]and he took the mantle of Elijah which had fallen from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah? He also smote the waters, and they parted hither and thither, and Elisha went over.
\[15]And the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho on the opposite side saw him, and they said, The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him,
\[16]and said to him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty valiant men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master, lest perhaps the Spirit of Jehovah have taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some ravine. And he said, Ye shall not send.
\[17]And they pressed him till he was ashamed, and he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men, and they sought three days, but did not find him.
\[18]And they came again to him (now he was staying at Jericho); and he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?
\[19]And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold now, the situation of the city is good, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is barren.
\[20]And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt in it. And they brought it to him.
\[21]And he went forth to the source of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith Jehovah: I have healed these waters: there shall not be from thence any more death or barrenness.
\[22]And the waters were healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.
\[23]And he went up from thence to Bethel, and as he went up by the way, there came forth little boys out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, bald head; go up, bald head!
\[24]And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tore forty-two children of them.
\[25]And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.

nd Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; and he reigned twelve years.
\[2]And he wrought evil in the sight of Jehovah, but not like his father, and like his mother; and he took away the column of Baal that his father had made.
\[3]Only, he clave to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel to sin: he did not depart therefrom.
\[4]And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand rams, with the wool.
\[5]And it came to pass when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
\[6]And at that time king Jehoram went out of Samaria and inspected all Israel.
\[7]And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
\[8]And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he said, By way of the wilderness of Edom.
\[9]And the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom, and they made a circuit of seven days' journey. And there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that followed them.
\[10]And the king of Israel said, Alas! that Jehovah has called these three kings together, to give them into the hand of Moab!
\[11]And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.
\[12]And Jehoshaphat said, The word of Jehovah is with him. And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
\[13]And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him, Not so, for Jehovah has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.
\[14]And Elisha said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee nor see thee.
\[15]And now fetch me a minstrel. And it came to pass when the minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah was upon him.
\[16]And he said, Thus saith Jehovah: Make this valley full of ditches.
\[17]For thus saith Jehovah: Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet this valley shall be filled with water, and ye shall drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.
\[18]And this is a light thing in the sight of Jehovah: he will give the Moabites also into your hand.
\[19]And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.
\[20]And it came to pass in the morning, when the oblation was offered up, that behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
\[21]And all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, and they were called together, all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood by the border.
\[22]And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun rose upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side red as blood.
\[23]And they said, This is blood: the kings are entirely destroyed, and have smitten one another; and now, Moab, to the spoil!
\[24]And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, and they fled before them; and they entered in and smote Moab.
\[25]And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone and filled it, and they stopped every well of water, and felled every good tree, until they left [only] the stones at Kirhareseth; and the slingers went about it, and smote it.
\[26]And the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, and he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not.
\[27]And he took his eldest son, that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him up for a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to [their own] land.

nd a woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried to Elisha saying, Thy servant my husband is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant feared Jehovah; and the creditor is come to take my two children to be bondmen.
\[2]And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for thee? Tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid has not anything at all in the house but a pot of oil.
\[3]And he said, Go, borrow for thyself vessels abroad from all thy neighbours, empty vessels; let it not be few;
\[4]and go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels, and set aside what is full.
\[5]And she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons: they brought [the vessels] to her, and she poured out.
\[6]And it came to pass when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.
\[7]And she came and told the man of God; and he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou [and] thy sons on the rest.
\[8]And it came to pass on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a wealthy woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, [that] as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.
\[9]And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who passes by us continually.
\[10]Let us make, I pray thee, a small upper chamber with walls, and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a lampstand; and it shall be when he cometh to us, he shall turn in thither.
\[11]And it came to pass on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the upper chamber, and lay there.
\[12]And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And he called her, and she stood before him.
\[13]And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she said, I dwell among mine own people.
\[14]And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi said, Verily, she has no son, and her husband is old.
\[15]And he said, Call her; and he called her; and she stood in the doorway.
\[16]And he said, At this appointed time, when thy term is come, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, man of God, do not lie to thy handmaid.
\[17]And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that appointed time in the next year as Elisha had said to her.
\[18]And the child grew, and it came to pass one day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.
\[19]And he said to his father, My head, my head! And he said to the servant, Carry him to his mother.
\[20]And he carried him, and brought him to his mother; and he sat on her knees till noon, and died.
\[21]And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut [the door] upon him, and went out.
\[22]And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, and I will run to the man of God, and come again.
\[23]And he said, Why wilt thou go to him to-day? It is neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, [It is] well.
\[24]Then she saddled the ass, and said to her servant, Drive and go forward; slack not the riding for me, except I bid thee.
\[25]And she went and came to the man of God, to mount Carmel. And it came to pass when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, there is the Shunammite:
\[26]run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she said, It is well.
\[27]And she came to the man of God to the mountain, and caught him by the feet; and Gehazi drew near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone, for her soul is troubled within her, and Jehovah has hidden it from me, and has not told me.
\[28]And she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?
\[29]And he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way. If thou meet any man, salute him not, and if any salute thee, answer him not again; and lay my staff upon the face of the lad.
\[30]And the mother of the lad said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! And he rose up and followed her.
\[31]And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the lad; but there was neither voice, nor sign of attention. And he returned to meet him, and told him saying, The lad is not awaked.
\[32]And when Elisha came into the house, behold, the child was dead, [and] laid upon his bed.
\[33]And he went in and shut the door upon them both, and prayed to Jehovah.
\[34]And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands, and bent over him; and the flesh of the child grew warm.
\[35]And he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and bent over him. And the lad sneezed seven times, and the lad opened his eyes.
\[36]And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. And he called her; and she came to him. And he said, Take up thy son.
\[37]And she came and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.
\[38]And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And there was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him. And he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.
\[39]Then one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it his lap full of wild colocynths, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; for they did not know them.
\[40]And they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out and said, Man of God, there is death in the pot! And they could not eat [it].
\[41]And he said, Then bring meal. And he cast [it] into the pot, and said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.
\[42]And there came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of corn in his sack. And he said, Give to the people that they may eat.
\[43]And his attendant said, How shall I set this before a hundred men? And he said, Give the people that they may eat; for thus saith Jehovah: They shall eat, and shall have to spare.

nd Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man before his master, and honourable, for by him Jehovah had given deliverance to Syria; and he was a mighty man of valour, [but] a leper.
\[2]And the Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.
\[3]And she said to her mistress, Oh, would that my lord were before the prophet that is in Samaria! then he would cure him of his leprosy.
\[4]And he went and told his lord saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.
\[5]And the king of Syria said, Well! go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand [shekels] of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
\[6]And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And now, when this letter comes to thee, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest cure him of his leprosy.
\[7]And it came to pass when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his garments, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to cure a man of his leprosy? Wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeks an occasion against me.
\[8]And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his garments, that he sent to the king, saying, Why hast thou rent thy garments? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
\[9]And Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the doorway of the house of Elisha.
\[10]And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.
\[11]And Naaman was wroth, and went away and said, Behold, I thought, He will certainly come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Jehovah his God, and wave his hand over the place, and cure the leper.
\[12]Are not the Abanah and the Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them and be clean? And he turned and went away in a rage.
\[13]And his servants drew near, and spoke to him and said, My father, [if] the prophet had bidden thee [do some] great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he says to thee, Wash and be clean?
\[14]Then he went down, and plunged himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God. And his flesh became again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
\[15]And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came and stood before him; and he said, Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel; and now, I pray thee, take a present of thy servant.
\[16]But he said, As Jehovah liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none! And he urged him to take it; but he refused.
\[17]And Naaman said, If not, then let there, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of [this] earth; for thy servant will no more offer burnt-offering and sacrifice to other gods, but to Jehovah.
\[18]In this thing Jehovah pardon thy servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to bow down there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon—when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, Jehovah pardon thy servant, I pray thee, in this thing.
\[19]And he said to him, Go in peace. And he departed from him a little way.
\[20]And Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared Naaman, this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought; but as Jehovah liveth, I will run after him and take somewhat of him.
\[21]And Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he sprang down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?
\[22]And he said, All is well. My master has sent me saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.
\[23]And Naaman said, Consent to take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his young men; and they bore them before him.
\[24]And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and stowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed.
\[25]And he entered in and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, Whence [comest thou], Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.
\[26]And he said to him, Did not my heart go, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and bondmen, and bondwomen?
\[27]But the leprosy of Naaman shall fasten upon thee, and upon thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence leprous, as snow.

\[19]And Elisha said to them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. And he led them to Samaria.
\[20]And it came to pass when they entered into Samaria, that Elisha said, Jehovah, open the eyes of these [men] that they may see. And Jehovah opened their eyes, and they saw, and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
\[21]And the king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite? shall I smite [them]?
\[22]And he said, Thou shalt not smite [them]: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.
\[23]And he prepared a great repast for them, and they ate and drank; and he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
\[24]And it came to pass after this that Ben-Hadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria.
\[25]And there was a great famine in Samaria; and behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was worth eighty silver-pieces, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung five silver-pieces.
\[26]And it came to pass as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman to him saying, Help, my lord O king!
\[27]And he said, If Jehovah do not help thee, whence should I help thee? Out of the threshing-floor, or out of the winepress?
\[28]And the king said to her, What aileth thee? And she said, This woman said to me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow.
\[29]And we boiled my son, and ate him: and I said to her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him; and she has hidden her son.
\[30]And it came to pass when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his garments; and he was passing by upon the wall, and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.
\[31]And he said, God do so, and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall remain on him this day!
\[32]And Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him. And [the king] sent a man before him. Before the messenger came to him, he himself said to the elders, Do ye see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? See, when the messenger comes; shut the door, and keep him off with the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?
\[33]And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down to him. And [the king] said, Behold, this evil is of Jehovah: why should I wait for Jehovah any longer?

nd Elisha said, Hear the word of Jehovah. Thus saith Jehovah: To-morrow about this time shall the measure of fine flour be at a shekel, and two measures of barley at a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
\[2]And the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said, Behold, if Jehovah should make windows in the heavens, would this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.
\[3]And there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate, and they said one to another, Why do we abide here until we die?
\[4]If we say, Let us enter into the city, the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we abide here, we shall die. And now come, let us fall away to the camp of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they put us to death, we shall but die.
\[5]And they rose up in the dusk to go to the camp of the Syrians; and they came to the extremity of the camp of the Syrians; and behold, there was no man there.
\[6]For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, a noise of a great host; and they said one to another, Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.
\[7]And they rose up and fled in the dusk, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, the camp as it was, and fled for their life.
\[8]And those lepers came to the extremity of the camp; and they went into one tent, and ate and drank, and carried thence silver and gold, and garments, and went and hid it; and they came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence, and went and hid [it].
\[9]And they said one to another, We are not doing right; this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, the iniquity will find us out; and now come, let us go and tell the king's household.
\[10]And they came and called to the porters of the city, and told them saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and behold, there was no one there, no sound of man, but the horses tied, and the asses tied, and the tents as they were.
\[11]And the porters cried [it] and told [it] to the king's house within.
\[12]And the king rose up in the night and said to his servants, Let me tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry, and they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.
\[13]And one of his servants answered and said, Let some one take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that have perished), and let us send and see.
\[14]And they took two chariots with their horses; and the king sent after the army of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.
\[15]And they went after them to the Jordan; and behold, all the way was full of garments and materials, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned and told the king.
\[16]And the people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians; and the measure of fine flour was at a shekel, and two measures of barley at a shekel, according to the word of Jehovah.
\[17]And the king had appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate; and the people trampled upon him in the gate, and he died, according to what the man of God had said,—what he had said when the king came down to him.
\[18]And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king saying, Two measures of barley shall be at a shekel, and the measure of fine flour at a shekel, to-morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria.
\[19]And the captain answered the man of God and said, Behold, if Jehovah should make windows in the heavens, would such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.
\[20]And so it happened to him; and the people trampled upon him in the gate, and he died.

nd Elisha had spoken to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, Rise up and go, thou and thy household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn; for Jehovah has called for a famine, and it shall also come upon the land for seven years.
\[2]And the woman rose up, and did according to the saying of the man of God, and went, she and her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
\[3]And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines; and she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land.
\[4]And the king was talking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha has done.
\[5]And it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.
\[6]And the king asked the woman, and she told him. And the king appointed a certain chamberlain, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the revenue of the land since the day that she left the country even until now.
\[7]And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-Hadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him saying, The man of God is come hither.
\[8]And the king said to Hazael, Take a present in thy hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of Jehovah by him, saying, Shall I recover from this disease?
\[9]And Hazael went to meet him, and took with him a present, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden; and he came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-Hadad king of Syria has sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover from this disease?
\[10]And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, Thou wilt certainly recover. But Jehovah has shewn me that he shall certainly die.
\[11]And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed; and the man of God wept.
\[12]And Hazael said, Why does my lord weep? And he said, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do to the children of Israel: their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou kill with the sword, and wilt dash in pieces their children, and rip up their women with child.
\[13]And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha said, Jehovah has shewn me that thou wilt be king over Syria.
\[14]And he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, What did Elisha say to thee? And he said, He told me [that] thou wouldest certainly recover.
\[15]And it came to pass the next day, that he took the coverlet and dipped [it] in water, and spread it over his face, so that he died; and Hazael reigned in his stead.
\[16]And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, began to reign.
\[17]He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
\[18]And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in the sight of Jehovah.
\[19]But Jehovah would not destroy Judah, for David his servant's sake, as he had promised him to give him always a lamp for his sons.
\[20]In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and they set a king over themselves.
\[21]And Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him; and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites who had surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled into their tents.
\[22]But the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
\[23]And the rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[24]And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
\[25]In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign.
\[26]Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
\[27]And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of Jehovah, like the house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.
\[28]And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael the king of Syria at Ramoth-Gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
\[29]And king Joram returned to be healed in Jizreel of the wounds that the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram the son of Ahab at Jizreel, for he was sick.

nd Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up thy loins, and take this vial of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-Gilead.
\[2]And when thou art come thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him rise up from among his brethren, and bring him to an inner chamber;
\[3]then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head and say, Thus saith Jehovah: I have anointed thee king over Israel; and open the door, and flee, and tarry not.
\[4]And the young man, the young prophet, went to Ramoth-Gilead.
\[5]And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting. And he said, I have an errand to thee, captain. And Jehu said, To which of all of us? And he said, To thee, captain.
\[6]And he rose up and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: I have anointed thee king over the people of Jehovah, over Israel.
\[7]And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master; and I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Jehovah at the hand of Jezebel.
\[8]And the whole house of Ahab shall perish, and I will cut off from Ahab every male, and him that is shut up and left in Israel.
\[9]And I will make the house of Ahab as the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and as the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.
\[10]And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the plot of Jizreel, and none shall bury her. And he opened the door and fled.
\[11]And Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord. And one said to him, Is all well? why came this madman to thee? And he said to them, Ye know the man, and his mind.
\[12]And they said, It is false! tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spoke he to me saying, Thus saith Jehovah: I have anointed thee king over Israel.
\[13]Then they hasted and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the very stairs, and blew with trumpets, and said, Jehu is king!
\[14]And Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram kept Ramoth-Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;
\[15]and king Joram had returned to be healed in Jizreel of the wounds that the Syrians had given him, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your will, let not a fugitive escape out of the city to go to tell [it] in Jizreel.
\[16]And Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jizreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.
\[17]And the watchman stood on the tower in Jizreel, and saw Jehu's company as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?
\[18]So there went one on horseback to meet him; and he said, Thus saith the king: Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told saying, The messenger came to them, and he does not return.
\[19]And he sent out a second on horseback; and he came to them and said, Thus saith the king: Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.
\[20]And the watchman told saying, He came to them, and does not return. And the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously.
\[21]Then Joram said, Make ready! And they made ready his chariot. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot; and they went out to meet Jehu, and met him in the plot of Naboth the Jizreelite.
\[22]And it came to pass when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he said, What peace, so long as the fornications of thy mother Jezebel and her sorceries are so many?
\[23]Then Joram turned his hand, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, Treachery, Ahaziah!
\[24]And Jehu took his bow in his hand, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out through his heart; and he sank down in his chariot.
\[25]And he said to Bidkar his captain, Take him up [and] cast him in the plot of the field of Naboth the Jizreelite. For remember how, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, that Jehovah laid this burden upon him:
\[26]Certainly I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith Jehovah; and I will requite thee in this plot, saith Jehovah. And now, take [and] cast him into the plot, according to the word of Jehovah.
\[27]When Ahaziah king of Judah saw [that], he fled by the way of the garden-house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in his chariot. It was on the ascent of Gur, which is by Jibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.
\[28]And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.
\[29](And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab had Ahaziah begun to reign over Judah.)
\[30]And Jehu came to Jizreel; and Jezebel heard of it, and she put paint to her eyes, and decked her head, and looked out at the window.
\[31]And when Jehu came in at the gate, she said, Is it peace, Zimri, murderer of his master?
\[32]And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And two or three chamberlains looked out to him.
\[33]And he said, Throw her down! And they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses; and he trampled on her.
\[34]And he came in, and ate and drank; and he said, Go, look, I pray you, after this cursed [woman], and bury her; for she is a king's daughter.
\[35]And they went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of the hands.
\[36]And they came back and told him. And he said, This is the word of Jehovah, which he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite saying, In the plot of Jizreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel;
\[37]and the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the open field in the plot of Jizreel, so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.

ow Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the princes of Jizreel, to the elders, and to Ahab's guardians, saying,
\[2]And now, when this letter comes to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots, and horses, and a fortified city, and armour,
\[3]look out the best and worthiest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.
\[4]And they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, the two kings stood not before him; and how shall we stand?
\[5]And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, and the elders, and the guardians sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any one king; do what is good in thy sight.
\[6]And he wrote a letter the second time to them saying, If ye are mine, and will hearken to my voice, take the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jizreel to-morrow at this time. Now the king's sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up.
\[7]And it came to pass when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slaughtered seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jizreel.
\[8]And a messenger came and told him saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.
\[9]And it came to pass in the morning that he went out; and he stood, and said to all the people, Ye are righteous! behold, I conspired against my master and killed him; but who smote all these?
\[10]Know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of Jehovah, which Jehovah spoke concerning the house of Ahab; for Jehovah has done that which he said through his servant Elijah.
\[11]And Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jizreel, and all his great men, and his acquaintances, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.
\[12]And he rose up and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shepherds' meeting-place on the way,
\[13]Jehu found the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they said, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and have come down to salute the children of the king, and the children of the queen.
\[14]And he said, Take them alive! And they took them alive, and slew them at the well of the meeting-place, forty-two men; and he left not one of them remaining.
\[15]And he departed thence, and found Jehonadab the son of Rechab [coming] to meet him; and he greeted him, and said to him, Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab said, It is.—If it be, give [me] thy hand.—And he gave [him] his hand; and [Jehu] took him up to him into the chariot,
\[16]and said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Jehovah. So they made him ride in his chariot.
\[17]And he came to Samaria, and smote all that remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to the word of Jehovah which he spoke to Elijah.
\[18]And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little: Jehu will serve him much.
\[19]And now call me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests: let none be wanting; for I have a great sacrifice [to do] to Baal; whoever shall be wanting shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, in order that he might bring destruction upon the servants of Baal.
\[20]And Jehu said, Hallow a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed [it].
\[21]And Jehu sent into all Israel; and all the servants of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not: and they entered into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to the other.
\[22]And he said to him that was over the wardrobe, Bring forth vestments for all the servants of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.
\[23]And Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Rechab entered into the house of Baal, and said to the servants of Baal, Search, and see that there be here with you none of the servants of Jehovah, but the servants of Baal only.
\[24]And they entered in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings. Now Jehu appointed eighty men without, and said, He that allows any of the men to escape that I have brought into your hands, his life shall be for the life of him.
\[25]And it came to pass as soon as they had ended offering up the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the couriers and to the captains, Go in, slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the couriers and the captains cast [them] there. And they went to the city of the house of Baal,
\[26]and brought forth the columns out of the house of Baal, and burned them;
\[27]and they broke down the column of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a draught-house to this day.
\[28]Thus Jehu extirpated Baal out of Israel.
\[29]Only, the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, from them Jehu departed not: [from] the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.
\[30]And Jehovah said to Jehu, Because thou hast executed well that which is right in my sight, [and] hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, thy children of the fourth [generation] shall sit on the throne of Israel.
\[31]But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Jehovah the God of Israel with all his heart; he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin.
\[32]In those days Jehovah began to cut Israel short; and Hazael smote them in all the borders of Israel;
\[33]from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, both Gilead and Bashan.
\[34]And the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[35]And Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria: and Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.

\[2]But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, the sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, [and hid] him and his nurse in the bedchamber; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.
\[3]And he was with her hid in the house of Jehovah six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land.
\[4]And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains of the hundreds, of the bodyguard and the couriers, and brought them to him into the house of Jehovah, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of Jehovah, and shewed them the king's son.
\[5]And he commanded them saying, This is the thing which ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the king's house;
\[6]and a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the couriers; and ye shall keep the watch of the house for a defence.
\[7]And the two parts of you, all those that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of Jehovah about the king.
\[8]And ye shall encompass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he that comes within the ranks shall be put to death; and ye shall be with the king when he goes out and when he comes in.
\[9]And the captains of the hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go forth on the sabbath, and they came to Jehoiada the priest.
\[10]And the priest gave to the captains of the hundreds king David's spears and shields which were in the house of Jehovah.
\[11]And the couriers stood by the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, toward the altar and the house.
\[12]And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and [gave him] the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, Long live the king!
\[13]And Athaliah heard the noise of the couriers [and] of the people; and she came to the people into the house of Jehovah.
\[14]And she looked, and behold, the king stood on the dais, according to the custom, and the princes and the trumpeters were by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets. And Athaliah rent her garments and cried, Conspiracy! Conspiracy!
\[15]And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds that were set over the host, and said to them, Lead her forth without the ranks; and whosoever follows her, slay with the sword; for the priest said, Let her not be put to death in the house of Jehovah.
\[16]And they made way for her, and she went by the way by which the horses entered the king's house, and there was she put to death.
\[17]And Jehoiada made a covenant between Jehovah and the king and the people, that they should be the people of Jehovah; and between the king and the people.
\[18]Then all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and broke it down: his altars and his images they broke in pieces completely, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of Jehovah.
\[19]And he took the captains of the hundreds, and the bodyguard, and the couriers, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of Jehovah, and came by the way through the gate of the couriers into the king's house. And he sat upon the throne of the kings.

\[2]And Jehoash did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, all the days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
\[3]Only, the high places were not removed: the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.

\[7]Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the priests, and said to them, Why have ye not repaired the breaches of the house? And now receive no money of your acquaintances, but give it for the breaches of the house.
\[8]And the priests consented to receive no money of the people, and that they should only repair the breaches of the house.
\[9]And Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of Jehovah; and the priests that kept the door put into it all the money brought into the house of Jehovah.
\[10]And it came to pass when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they tied up and counted the money that was found in the house of Jehovah.
\[11]And they gave the money, weighed out into the hands of them that did the work, who were appointed over the house of Jehovah; and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders that wrought upon the house of Jehovah,
\[12]and to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of Jehovah, and for all that had to be laid out on the house for repairs.
\[13]However there were not made for the house of Jehovah basons of silver, knives, bowls, trumpets, nor any utensil of gold or utensil of silver, of the money that was brought [into] the house of Jehovah;
\[14]but they gave that to the workmen, and repaired the house of Jehovah with it.
\[15]And they did not reckon with the men into whose hand they gave the money to be bestowed on workmen; for they dealt faithfully.
\[16]The money of trespass-offerings, and the money of sin-offerings, was not brought into the house of Jehovah: it was for the priests.
\[17]Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it. And Hazael set his face to go up against Jerusalem.
\[18]And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold found in the treasures of the house of Jehovah and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria; and he went away from Jerusalem.
\[19]And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[20]And his servants rose up and made a conspiracy, and smote Joash in the house of Millo, at the descent of Silla.
\[21]And Jozachar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

\[3]And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Ben-Hadad the son of Hazael, all those days.
\[4](And Jehoahaz besought Jehovah, and Jehovah hearkened to him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.
\[5]And Jehovah gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as before.
\[6]Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin: they walked therein; and there remained also the Asherah in Samaria.)
\[7]For he had left of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.

\[14]And Elisha fell sick of his sickness in which he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, My father, my father! the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof!
\[15]And Elisha said to him, Take bow and arrows. And he took a bow and arrows.
\[16]And he said to the king of Israel, Put thy hand upon the bow. And he put his hand [upon it]; and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands,
\[17]and said, Open the window eastward. And he opened [it]. And Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, An arrow of Jehovah's deliverance, even an arrow of deliverance from the Syrians; and thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou hast consumed [them].
\[18]And he said, Take the arrows. And he took [them]. And he said to the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed.
\[19]And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then wouldest thou have smitten the Syrians till thou hadst consumed [them]; whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.
\[20]And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
\[21]And it came to pass as they were burying a man, that behold, they saw the band, and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha; and the man went [down], and touched the bones of Elisha, and he revived, and stood upon his feet.
\[22]And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
\[23]And Jehovah was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and he would not destroy them, neither did he cast them from his presence up to that time.
\[24]And Hazael king of Syria died, and Ben-Hadad his son reigned in his stead.
\[25]And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-Hadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father in the war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.

\[4]Only, the high places were not removed: the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
\[5]And it came to pass when the kingdom was established in his hand, that he slew his servants who had smitten the king his father.
\[6]But the children of those that smote [him] he did not put to death; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein Jehovah commanded saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
\[7]He smote of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Sela in the war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day.
\[8]Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
\[9]And Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thorn-bush that is in Lebanon sent to the cedar that is in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son as wife; and there passed by the wild beast that is in Lebanon, and trode down the thorn-bush.
\[10]Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thy heart has lifted thee up: boast thyself, and abide at home; for why shouldest thou contend with misfortune, that thou shouldest fall, thou, and Judah with thee?
\[11]But Amaziah would not hear. And Jehoash king of Israel went up; and they looked one another in the face, he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth-shemesh, which is in Judah.
\[12]And Judah was routed before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.
\[13]And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner-gate, four hundred cubits.

\[25]He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath as far as the sea of the plain, according to the word of Jehovah the God of Israel, which he had spoken through his servant Jonah the prophet, the son of Amittai, who was of Gath-Hepher.
\[26]For Jehovah saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter; and that there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel.
\[27]And Jehovah had not said that he would blot out the name of Israel from under the heavens; and he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.

n the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign in Samaria over Israel, for nine years.
\[2]And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, but not as the kings of Israel that had been before him.
\[3]Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria, and Hoshea became his servant, and tendered him presents.
\[4]But the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and sent up no present to the king of Assyria as [he had done] from year to year. And the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison.
\[5]And the king of Assyria overran the whole land, and went up against Samaria, and besieged it three years.
\[6]In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and by the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
\[7]And so it was, because the children of Israel had sinned against Jehovah their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods;
\[8]and they walked in the statutes of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.
\[9]And the children of Israel did secretly against Jehovah their God things that were not right; and they built them high places in all their cities, from the watchmen's tower to the fortified city.
\[10]And they set them up columns and Asherahs on every high hill and under every green tree;
\[11]and there they burned incense on all the high places, as did the nations that Jehovah had carried away from before them, and they wrought wicked things to provoke Jehovah to anger;
\[12]and they served idols, as to which Jehovah had said to them, Ye shall not do this thing.
\[13]And Jehovah testified against Israel and against Judah, by all the prophets, all the seers, saying, Turn from your evil ways, and keep my commandments, my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you through my servants the prophets.
\[14]But they would not hear, and hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, who did not believe in Jehovah their God.
\[15]And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant which he had made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he had testified unto them; and they followed vanity and became vain, and [went] after the nations that were round about them, concerning whom Jehovah had charged them that they should not do like them.
\[16]And they forsook all the commandments of Jehovah their God, and made them molten images, two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshipped all the host of the heavens, and served Baal;
\[17]and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
\[18]Therefore Jehovah was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there remained but the tribe of Judah only.
\[19]Also Judah kept not the commandments of Jehovah their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they had made.
\[20]And Jehovah rejected all the seed of Israel; and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.
\[21]For Israel had rent [the kingdom] from the house of David; and they had made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king; and Jeroboam violently turned Israel from following Jehovah, and made them sin a great sin.
\[22]And the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they did not depart from them:
\[23]until Jehovah had removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said through all his servants the prophets; and Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria, unto this day.
\[24]And the king of Assyria brought [people] from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and made them dwell in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in its cities.
\[25]And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not Jehovah; and Jehovah sent lions among them, which killed [some] of them.
\[26]And they spoke to the king of Assyria saying, The nations that thou hast removed and made to dwell in the cities of Samaria know not the manner of the god of the land; therefore he has sent lions among them, and behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the god of the land.
\[27]And the king of Assyria commanded saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye have brought away from thence; and let them go and abide there, and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land.
\[28]Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and abode in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Jehovah.
\[29]And every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places that the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they dwelt.
\[30]And the people of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the people of Cuth made Nergal, and the people of Hamath made Ashima,
\[31]and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim.
\[32]So they feared Jehovah, and made to themselves from all classes of them priests of the high places, who offered [sacrifices] for them in the houses of the high places.
\[33]They feared Jehovah, and served their own gods after the manner of the nations, whence they had been carried away.
\[34]To this day they do after their former customs: they fear not Jehovah, neither do they after their statutes or after their ordinances, nor after the law and commandment that Jehovah commanded the sons of Jacob, whom he named Israel.
\[35]And Jehovah had made a covenant with them, and charged them saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow down yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them;
\[36]but Jehovah alone, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched-out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.
\[37]And the statutes and the ordinances and the law, and the commandment which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.
\[38]And ye shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you, neither shall ye fear other gods;
\[39]but ye shall fear Jehovah your God, and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
\[40]And they did not hearken, but did after their former customs.
\[41]And these nations feared Jehovah, and served their graven images, both their children and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they, unto this day.

\[14]And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have sinned; retire from me: I will bear what thou layest upon me. And the king of Assyria laid upon Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
\[15]And Hezekiah gave all the silver that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king's house.
\[16]At that time Hezekiah stripped the doors of the temple of Jehovah, and the posts that Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave them to the king of Assyria.
\[17]And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rab-shakeh from Lachish, with a strong force, against king Hezekiah, to Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool, which is on the highway of the fuller's field.
\[18]And they called to the king. Then came forth to them Eliakim the son of Hilkijah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the chronicler.
\[19]And Rab-shakeh said to them, Say now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
\[20]Thou sayest—but it is a word of the lips—There is counsel and strength for war. Now on whom dost thou rely, that thou hast revolted against me?
\[21]Now behold, thou reliest upon the staff of that broken reed, upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it goes into his hand and pierces it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that rely upon him.
\[22]And if ye say to me, We rely upon Jehovah our God: is it not he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
\[23]And now, engage, I pray thee, with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou canst set the riders upon them.
\[24]How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants? And thou reliest upon Egypt for chariots and for horsemen!
\[25]Am I now come up without Jehovah against this place to destroy it? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.
\[26]And Eliakim the son of Hilkijah, and Shebnah and Joah said to Rab-shakeh, Speak, we pray thee, to thy servants in Syriac, for we understand it, and talk not with us in the Jewish [language] in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
\[27]And Rab-shakeh said to them, Is it to thy master and to thee that my master sent me to speak these words? Is it not to the men that sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?
\[28]And Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish [language], and spoke and said, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!
\[29]Thus says the king: Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of the [king's] hand.
\[30]Neither let Hezekiah make you rely upon Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will certainly deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[31]Hearken not to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: Make peace with me, and come out to me; and eat every one of his vine and every one of his fig-tree, and drink every one the waters of his own cistern;
\[32]until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive-trees and of honey, that ye may live and not die; and hearken not to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us.
\[33]Have any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\[34]Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
\[35]Which are they among all the gods of the countries, who have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
\[36]But the people were silent and answered him not a word; for the king's command was, saying, Answer him not.
\[37]And Eliakim the son of Hilkijah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the chronicler, came to Hezekiah with their garments rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh.

nd it came to pass when king Hezekiah heard [it], that he rent his garments, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.
\[2]And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz.
\[3]And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of reviling; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
\[4]It may be Jehovah thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God; and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God has heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that is left.
\[5]And the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
\[6]And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master: Thus saith Jehovah: Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
\[7]Behold, I will put a spirit into him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return to his own land; and I will make him to fall by the sword in his own land.
\[8]And Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.
\[9]And he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he has come forth to make war with thee. And he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,
\[10]Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah saying: Let not thy God, upon whom thou reliest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[11]Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all countries, destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
\[12]Have the gods of the nations which my fathers have destroyed delivered them: Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Thelassar?
\[13]Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?
\[14]And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up into the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.
\[15]And Hezekiah prayed before Jehovah and said, Jehovah, God of Israel, who sittest [between] the cherubim, thou, the Same, thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made the heavens and the earth.
\[16]Incline thine ear, Jehovah, and hear; open, Jehovah, thine eyes, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent him to reproach the living God.
\[17]Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,
\[18]and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore have they destroyed them.
\[19]And now, Jehovah our God, I beseech thee, save us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou, Jehovah, art God, thou only.
\[20]And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: That which thou hast prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.
\[21]This is the word that Jehovah has spoken against him: The virgin-daughter of Zion despiseth thee, laugheth thee to scorn; The daughter of Jerusalem shaketh her head at thee.
\[22]Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted the voice? Against the Holy one of Israel hast thou lifted up thine eyes on high.
\[23]By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots have I come up To the height of the mountain, to the recesses of Lebanon, And I will cut down its tall cedars, the choice of its cypresses; And I will enter into its furthest lodging-place, [into] the forest of its fruitful field.
\[24]I have digged, and have drunk strange waters, And with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the streams of Matsor.
\[25]Hast thou not heard long ago that I have done it? And that from ancient days I formed it? Now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest lay waste fortified cities [into] ruinous heaps.
\[26]And their inhabitants were powerless, They were dismayed and put to shame; They were [as] the growing grass, and [as] the green herb, [As] the grass on the housetops, and grain blighted before it be grown up.
\[27]But I know thine abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, And thy raging against me.
\[28]Because thy raging against me and thine arrogance is come up into mine ears, I will put my ring in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, And I will make thee go back by the way by which thou camest.
\[29]And this [shall be] the sign unto thee: They shall eat this year such as groweth of itself, And in the second year that which springeth of the same; But in the third year sow ye and reap, And plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof.
\[30]And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah Shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward;
\[31]For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, And out of mount Zion they that escape: The zeal of Jehovah [of hosts] shall do this.
\[32]Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city, Nor shoot an arrow there, Nor come before it with shield, Nor cast a bank against it.
\[33]By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, And shall not come into this city, saith Jehovah.
\[34]And I will defend this city, to save it, For mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\[35]And it came to pass that night, that an angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand. And when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead bodies.
\[36]And Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and abode at Nineveh.
\[37]And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer [his sons] smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

n those days Hezekiah was sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.
\[2]And he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Jehovah saying,
\[3]Ah! Jehovah, remember, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done what is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept much.
\[4]And it came to pass before Isaiah had gone out into the middle city that the word of Jehovah came to him saying,
\[5]Return, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up to the house of Jehovah;
\[6]and I will add to thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\[7]And Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.
\[8]And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What [shall be] the sign that Jehovah will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of Jehovah the third day?
\[9]And Isaiah said, This [shall be] the sign to thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?
\[10]And Hezekiah said, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: no, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.
\[11]And Isaiah the prophet cried to Jehovah, and he brought the shadow back on the degrees by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward.
\[12]At that time Berodach-Baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent a letter and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
\[13]And Hezekiah hearkened to them, and shewed them all his treasure-house, the silver and the gold, and the spices and the fine oil, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found among his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not shew them.
\[14]Then came the prophet Isaiah to king Hezekiah and said to him, What said these men? and from whence came they to thee? And Hezekiah said, They came from a far country, from Babylon.
\[15]And he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah said, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewn them.
\[16]And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah:
\[17]Behold, days come that all that is in thy house, and what thy fathers have laid up until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah.
\[18]And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be chamberlains in the palace of the king of Babylon.
\[19]And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not so? if only there shall be peace and truth in my days!
\[20]And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool and the aqueduct, and brought the water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[21]And Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

anasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hephzibah.
\[2]And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, like the abominations of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed from before the children of Israel.
\[3]And he built again the high places that Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars to Baal and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
\[4]And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, of which Jehovah had said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.
\[5]And he built altars to all the host of heaven in both courts of the house of Jehovah.
\[6]And he caused his son to pass through the fire, and used magic and divination, and appointed necromancers and soothsayers: he wrought evil beyond measure in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
\[7]And he set the graven image of the Asherah that he had made, in the house of which Jehovah had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever;
\[8]neither will I any more cause the foot of Israel to wander away from the land that I gave their fathers; if they will only take heed to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.
\[9]But they would not hearken, and Manasseh led them astray to do more evil than the nations that Jehovah had destroyed from before the children of Israel.
\[10]And Jehovah spoke by his servants the prophets saying,
\[11]Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols;
\[12]therefore thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.
\[13]And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipeth a pan, wiping it and turning it upside down.
\[14]And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;
\[15]because they have done evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt even to this day.
\[16]And Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, till he had filled Jerusalem [with it] from one end to another; beside his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing evil in the sight of Jehovah.
\[17]And the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin which he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[18]And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza; and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
\[19]Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Meshullemeth, daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
\[20]And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, as Manasseh his father had done;
\[21]and he walked in all the way that his father had walked in, and served the idols that his father had served, and worshipped them;
\[22]and he forsook Jehovah the God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of Jehovah.
\[23]And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.
\[24]But the people of the land smote all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
\[25]And the rest of the acts of Amon, what he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

\[3]And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, [that] the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Jehovah, saying,
\[4]Go up to Hilkijah the high priest, that he may sum up the money which is brought into the house of Jehovah, which the doorkeepers have gathered of the people,
\[5]and let them give it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and let them give it to those that do the work in the house of Jehovah, to repair the breaches of the house,
\[6]to the carpenters and the builders and the masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.
\[7]But no reckoning was made with them of the money that was given into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.
\[8]And Hilkijah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkijah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
\[9]And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again and said, Thy servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah.
\[10]And Shaphan the scribe informed the king saying, Hilkijah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
\[11]And it came to pass when the king heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his garments.
\[12]And the king commanded Hilkijah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,
\[13]Go, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book which is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this book, to do according to all that is written [there] for us.
\[14]And Hilkijah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe: now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter [of the town]; and they spoke with her.
\[15]And she said to them, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: Tell the man that sent you to me,
\[16]Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof, all the words of the book that the king of Judah hath read.
\[17]Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my fury is kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.
\[18]But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him: Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel touching the words which thou hast heard:
\[19]Because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before Jehovah, when thou heardest what I spoke against this place and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and didst rend thy garments and weep before me, I also have heard [thee], saith Jehovah.
\[20]Therefore, behold, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil that I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.

\[2]And the king went up into the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which had been found in the house of Jehovah.
\[3]And the king stood on the dais, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all [his] heart, and with all [his] soul, to establish the words of this covenant that are written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.
\[4]And the king commanded Hilkijah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the doorkeepers, to bring forth out of the temple of Jehovah all the vessels that had been made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the host of the heavens; and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Bethel.
\[5]And he abolished the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense on the high places in the cities of Judah, and the environs of Jerusalem; and them that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the constellations, and to all the host of heaven.
\[6]And he brought out the Asherah from the house of Jehovah, outside Jerusalem, to the torrent of Kidron, and burned it at the torrent of Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder upon the graves of the children of the people.
\[7]And he broke down the houses of the sodomites, which were in the house of Jehovah, where the women wove tents for the Asherah.
\[8]And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba even to Beer-sheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates, those at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, [and] those on the left hand of any [going in] at the gate of the city.
\[9]Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of Jehovah in Jerusalem, but they ate of the unleavened bread among their brethren.
\[10]And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the sons of Hinnom, that no man might cause his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.
\[11]And he abolished the horses that the kings of Judah had appointed to the sun at the entrance of the house of Jehovah, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun, with fire.
\[12]And the king broke down the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars that Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of Jehovah, and he shattered them, [removing them] from thence, and cast the powder of them into the torrent of Kidron.
\[13]And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.
\[14]And he broke in pieces the columns, and cut down the Asherahs, and filled their place with the bones of men.
\[15]Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, the high place that Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down; and burned the high place, stamped it small to powder, and burned the Asherah.
\[16]And Josiah turned himself, and saw the sepulchres that were there on the mount; and he sent and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned [them] upon the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of Jehovah, that the man of God had proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.
\[17]Then he said, What tombstone is that which I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things which thou hast done against the altar of Bethel.
\[18]And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. And they saved his bones, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.
\[19]And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke [Jehovah] to anger, Josiah removed, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.
\[20]And he sacrificed upon the altars all the priests of the high places that were there, and burned men's bones upon them. And he returned to Jerusalem.
\[21]And the king commanded all the people saying, Hold the passover to Jehovah your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.
\[22]For there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;
\[23]but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this passover holden to Jehovah in Jerusalem.
\[24]Moreover the necromancers and the soothsayers, and the teraphim and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, Josiah took away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkijah the priest had found in the house of Jehovah.
\[25]And before him there had been no king like him that turned to Jehovah with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there his like.
\[26]But Jehovah turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked him.
\[27]And Jehovah said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will reject this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.
\[28]And the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[29]In his days Pharaoh-Nechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates; and king Josiah went against him; but [Nechoh] slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.
\[30]And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.
\[31]Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\[32]And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.
\[33]And Pharaoh-Nechoh had him bound at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and laid a tribute upon the land of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
\[34]And Pharaoh-Nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king instead of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And he took Jehoahaz; and he came to Egypt, and died there.
\[35]And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he laid a proportional tax on the land to give the money according to the command of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his estimation, to give it to Pharaoh-Nechoh.
\[36]Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Zebuddah, daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.

\[5]And the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[6]And Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
\[7]And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt, from the torrent of Egypt to the river Euphrates.
\[8]Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Nehushta, daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
\[9]And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his father had done.
\[10]At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
\[11]And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, while his servants were besieging it.
\[12]And Jehoiachin king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his chamberlains; and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
\[13]And he brought out thence all the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold that Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of Jehovah, as Jehovah had said.
\[14]And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained but the poorest sort of the people of the land.
\[15]And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his chamberlains, and the mighty of the land, he led into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon;
\[16]and all the men of valour, seven thousand, and the craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all strong men apt for war, and the king of Babylon brought them captive to Babylon.
\[17]And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his uncle king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
\[18]Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\[19]And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
\[20]For, because the anger of Jehovah was against Jerusalem and against Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

nd it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, [that] Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built turrets against it round about.
\[2]And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
\[3]On the ninth of the [fourth] month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
\[4]And the city was broken into; and all the men of war [fled] by night, by the way of the gate between the two walls, which [leads] to the king's garden (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about); and they went the way toward the plain.
\[5]And the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
\[6]And they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon unto Riblah; and they pronounced judgment upon him,
\[7]and slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with chains of brass, and carried him to Babylon.
\[8]And in the fifth month, on the seventh of the month, which was in the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzar-adan, captain of the body-guard, servant of the king of Babylon, came unto Jerusalem;
\[9]and he burned the house of Jehovah, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; and every great [man's] house he burned with fire.
\[10]And all the army of the Chaldeans that were with the captain of the body-guard broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.
\[11]And Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard carried away captive the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the deserters that had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
\[12]But the captain of the body-guard left of the poor of the land for vinedressers and husbandmen.
\[13]And the brazen pillars that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of Jehovah, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried the brass thereof to Babylon.
\[14]The cauldrons also and the shovels and the knives and the cups, and all the vessels of copper wherewith they ministered, they took away.
\[15]And the censers and the bowls, that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, the captain of the body-guard took away.
\[16]The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah: for the brass of all these vessels there was no weight.
\[17]The height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the capital upon it was brass, and the height of the capital three cubits; and the network and the pomegranates, upon the capital round about, all of brass: and similarly for the second pillar with the network.
\[18]And the captain of the body-guard took Seraiah the high priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.
\[19]And out of the city he took a chamberlain that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, who were found in the city, and the scribe of the captain of the host, who enrolled the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land that were found in the city.
\[20]And Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah;
\[21]and the king of Babylon smote them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his land.
\[22]And [as for] the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left behind, over them he appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan.
\[23]And all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, and they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, namely, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
\[24]And Gedaliah swore unto them and to their men, and said to them, Fear not to be servants of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
\[25]And it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal seed, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah.
\[26]And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
\[27]And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh of the month, [that] Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;
\[28]and he spoke kindly to him, and set his seat above the seat of the kings that were with him in Babylon.
\[29]And he changed his prison garments; and he ate bread before him continually all the days of his life;
\[30]and his allowance was a continual allowance given him by the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.

\[8]and Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelt in Aroer, as far as Nebo and Baal-meon;
\[9]and eastward he dwelt as far as the entrance to the wilderness from the river Euphrates; for their cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead.
\[10]And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand; and they dwelt in their tents throughout the east side of Gilead.
\[11]And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land of Bashan, as far as Salcah:
\[12]Joel was the chief and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat in Bashan.
\[13]And their brethren according to their fathers' houses were Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jaachan, and Zia, and Eber, seven.
\[14]—These were the sons of Abihail, the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz:
\[15]Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, was chief of their fathers' house.
\[16]And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in its towns, and in all the pasture-grounds of Sharon, as far as their limits.
\[17]All these were registered by genealogy in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.
\[18]The children of Reuben and the Gadites and half the tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men who carried shield and sword, drawing the bow and skilful in war, were forty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty, able to go forth to war.
\[19]And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab;
\[20]and they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them; for they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them, because they put their trust in him.
\[21]And they took away their cattle: their camels fifty thousand, and two hundred and fifty thousand sheep, and two thousand asses, and a hundred thousand human souls.
\[22]For there fell down many slain, for the war was of God. And they dwelt in their stead until the captivity.
\[23]And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land, from Bashan as far as Baal-Hermon and Senir, and mount Hermon; they were many.
\[24]And these were the heads of their fathers' houses: Epher, and Jishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, heads of their fathers' houses.
\[25]And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them.
\[26]And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath-Pilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan,—unto this day.

\[13]And Saul died for his unfaithfulness which he committed against Jehovah, because of the word of Jehovah which he kept not, and also for having inquired of the spirit of Python, asking counsel of it;
\[14]and he asked not counsel of Jehovah; therefore he slew him, and transferred the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.

nd all Israel assembled themselves to David to Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
\[2]Even aforetime, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel; and Jehovah thy God said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over my people Israel.
\[3]And all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah; and they anointed David king over Israel according to the word of Jehovah through Samuel.
\[4]And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.
\[5]And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come in hither. But David took the stronghold of Zion, which is the city of David.
\[6]And David said, Whoever smites the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.
\[7]And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David.
\[8]And he built the city round about, even from the Millo round about; and Joab renewed the rest of the city.
\[9]And David became continually greater; and Jehovah of hosts was with him.
\[10]And these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who shewed themselves valiant with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of Jehovah concerning Israel.
\[11]And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of Hachmoni, the chief of the captains; he brandished his spear against three hundred, slain [by him] at one time.
\[12]And after him, Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite; he was one of the three mighty men.
\[13]He was with David at Pas-dammim, where the Philistines were gathered together to battle; and there was [there] a plot of ground full of barley; and the people had fled from before the Philistines.
\[14]And they stood in the midst of the plot and delivered it, and smote the Philistines; and Jehovah wrought a great deliverance.
\[15]And three of the thirty chiefs went down to the rock to David, to the cave of Adullam, when the army of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
\[16]And David was then in the stronghold; and the Philistines' garrison was then at Bethlehem.
\[17]And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me to drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate!
\[18]And the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; David however would not drink of it, but poured it out to Jehovah.
\[19]And he said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing! should I drink the blood of these men [who went] at the risk of their lives? for at the risk of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
\[20]And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was the chief of three; and he brandished his spear against three hundred and slew them; and he had a name among the three.
\[21]Of the three he was more honourable than the two, and he was their captain; but he did not attain to the [first] three.
\[22]Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, great in exploits, of Kabzeel: he it was that smote two lions of Moab; and he went down and smote a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.
\[23]He also smote the Egyptian, a man of stature, five cubits high: and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
\[24]These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he had a name among the three mighty men.
\[25]Behold, he was honoured above the thirty, but he did not attain to the [first] three. And David set him in his council.
\[26]And the valiant men of the forces were: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
\[27]Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
\[28]Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,

\[10]Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
\[11]Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
\[12]Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
\[13]Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh.
\[14]These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least was over a hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.
\[15]These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it overflows all its banks, and they put to flight all [them] of the valleys, toward the east and toward the west.
\[16]And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold to David.
\[17]And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If ye come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit unto you; but if to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers see [it] and rebuke [it].
\[18]And the Spirit came upon Amasai, the chief of the captains, [and he said,] Thine [are we], David, And with thee, thou son of Jesse: Peace, peace be to thee! And peace be to thy helpers! For thy God helps thee. And David received them, and made them chiefs of bands.
\[19]And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not; for the lords of the Philistines upon deliberation sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul at the peril of our heads.
\[20]As he went away to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh: Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.
\[21]And they helped David in his expeditions; for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.
\[22]For day by day there came [men] to David to help him, until it was a great camp, like the camp of God.
\[23]And this is the number of the men equipped for military service, who came to David to Hebron, to transfer the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of Jehovah.
\[24]The children of Judah that bore shield and spear were six thousand eight hundred, equipped for military service.
\[25]Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for war, seven thousand one hundred.
\[26]Of the children of Levi four thousand six hundred.
\[27]And Jehoiada the prince of Aaron, and with him were three thousand seven hundred;
\[28]and Zadok, a valiant young man, and his father's house two and twenty chief men.
\[29]And of the children of Benjamin, the brethren of Saul, three thousand; but hitherto the greater part of them had adhered to the house of Saul.
\[30]And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valour, men of name in their fathers' houses.
\[31]And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were expressed by name, to come and make David king.
\[32]And of the children of Issachar, who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their bidding.
\[33]Of Zebulun, such as went forth in the host, armed for war with all weapons of war, fifty thousand, keeping rank without double heart.
\[34]And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them thirty-seven thousand with shield and spear.
\[35]And of the Danites armed for war twenty-eight thousand six hundred.
\[36]And of Asher such as went forth in the host, to set themselves in battle array, forty thousand.
\[37]And from the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of weapons of war for battle, a hundred and twenty thousand.
\[38]All of them men of war, keeping rank in battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.
\[39]And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brethren had prepared for them;
\[40]and those too that were near them, as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought food on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen; provisions of meal, fig-cakes and raisin-cakes, and wine and oil, and oxen and sheep, abundantly; for there was joy in Israel.

\[3]and let us bring again the ark of our God to us; for we inquired not of it in the days of Saul.
\[4]And all the congregation said that they should do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
\[5]And David assembled all Israel from the Shihor of Egypt unto the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim.
\[6]And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, to Kirjath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, of Jehovah, who sitteth between the cherubim, whose name is placed [there].
\[7]And they carried the ark of God on a new cart out of the house of Abinadab; and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.
\[8]And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with lutes, and with tambours, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
\[9]And when they came to the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen had stumbled.
\[10]And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he had put forth his hand to the ark; and there he died before God.
\[11]And David was indignant; for Jehovah had made a breach upon Uzza; and he called that place Perez-Uzza to this day.
\[12]And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God to me?
\[13]And David brought not the ark home unto himself into the city of David, but he carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
\[14]And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months. And Jehovah blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that he had.

\[9]And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\[10]And David inquired of God saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines, and wilt thou give them into my hand? And Jehovah said to him, Go up; and I will give them into thy hand.
\[11]And they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said, God has broken in upon mine enemies by my hand, as the breaking forth of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
\[12]And they left their gods there; and David commanded, and they were burned with fire.
\[13]And the Philistines yet again spread themselves in the valley.
\[14]And David inquired again of God; and God said to him, Go not up after them; turn round them and come upon them opposite the mulberry-trees.
\[15]And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for God will have gone forth before thee to smite the army of the Philistines.
\[16]And David did as God commanded him; and they smote the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.

\[3]And David assembled all Israel to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Jehovah to its place that he had prepared for it.
\[4]And David gathered the sons of Aaron and the Levites:

\[7]of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and thirty;

\[9]of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brethren eighty;
\[10]of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve.

\[12]and he said to them, Ye are the chief fathers of the Levites; hallow yourselves, ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel to [the place that] I have prepared for it.
\[13]For because ye did [it] not at the first, Jehovah our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.

\[15]And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves upon them, as Moses had commanded according to the word of Jehovah.
\[16]And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren, the singers, with instruments of music, lutes, and harps, and cymbals, that they should sound aloud, lifting up the voice with joy.
\[17]And the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;

\[16]Which he made with Abraham, And of his oath unto Isaac;
\[17]And he confirmed it unto Jacob for a statute, Unto Israel for an everlasting covenant,
\[18]Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;
\[19]When ye were a few men in number, Of small account, and strangers in it.

\[21]He suffered no man to oppress them, And reproved kings for their sakes,
\[22][Saying,] Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.
\[23]Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth; Publish his salvation from day to day.
\[24]Declare his glory among the nations, His wondrous works among all peoples.
\[25]For Jehovah is great, and exceedingly to be praised; And he is terrible above all gods.
\[26]For all the gods of the peoples are idols; But Jehovah made the heavens.
\[27]Majesty and splendour are before him; Strength and gladness in his place.
\[28]Give unto Jehovah, ye families of peoples, Give unto Jehovah glory and strength!
\[29]Give unto Jehovah the glory of his name! Bring an oblation, and come before him: Worship Jehovah in holy splendour.
\[30]Tremble before him, all the earth: The world also is established, it shall not be moved.
\[31]Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth!
\[32]Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; Let the field exult, and all that is therein.
\[33]Then shall the trees of the forest sing out at the presence of Jehovah, For he cometh to judge the earth.
\[34]Give thanks unto Jehovah, for he is good; For his loving-kindness [endureth] for ever.

\[2]And Nathan said to David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee.
\[3]And it came to pass that night that the word of God came to Nathan saying,
\[4]Go and say to David my servant, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in;
\[5]for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day; but I have been from tent to tent, and from [one] tabernacle [to another].
\[6]In all my going about with all Israel, did I speak a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why build ye me not a house of cedars?
\[7]And now, thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I took thee from the pasture-grounds, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel;
\[8]and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name, like unto the name of the great men that are on the earth.
\[9]And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and be disturbed no more; neither shall the sons of wickedness waste them any more, as formerly,
\[10]and since the days that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. And I will subdue all thine enemies; and I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house.
\[11]And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go [to be] with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
\[12]It is he who shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.
\[13]I will be his father, and he shall be my son; and I will not take away my mercy from him, as I took it from him that was before thee;
\[14]and I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.
\[15]According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.
\[16]And king David went in and sat before Jehovah, and said, Who am I, Jehovah Elohim, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
\[17]And this hath been a small thing in thy sight, O God; and thou hast spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the rank of a man of high degree, Jehovah Elohim.
\[18]What can David [say] more to thee for the glory of thy servant? thou indeed knowest thy servant.
\[19]Jehovah, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, to make known all these great things.
\[20]Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
\[21]And who is like thy people Israel, the one nation in the earth that God went to redeem to be a people to himself, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, which thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?
\[22]And thy people Israel hast thou made thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, art become their God.
\[23]And now, Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.
\[24]Let it even be established, and let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, is God to Israel; and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.
\[25]For thou, my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house; therefore hath thy servant found [in his heart] to pray before thee.
\[26]And now, Jehovah, thou art that God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant;
\[27]and now, let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever; for thou, Jehovah, hast blessed [it], and it shall be blessed for ever.

\[2]And David said, I will shew kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
\[3]And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Is it, in thine eyes, to honour thy father that David has sent comforters to thee? Is it not to search and overthrow, and to spy out the land that his servants are come to thee?
\[4]And Hanun took David's servants, and had them shaved, and their raiment cut off in the midst, as far as the hip, and sent them away.
\[5]And [certain] went and told David concerning the men; and he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Abide at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
\[6]And the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David; and Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and from the Syrians of Maacah, and from Zobah.
\[7]And they hired thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people; and they came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered together from their cities, and came to battle.
\[8]And David heard [of it], and he sent Joab, and all the host, the mighty men.
\[9]And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the city; and the kings that had come were by themselves on the field.
\[10]And Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind; and he chose out of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians;
\[11]and the rest of the people he gave into the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.
\[12]And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; and if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.
\[13]Be strong, and let us shew ourselves valiant for our people, and for the cities of our God; and Jehovah will do what is good in his sight.
\[14]And Joab and the people that were with him drew near in front of the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.
\[15]And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. And Joab came to Jerusalem.
\[16]And when the Syrians saw that they were routed before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river; and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer [went] before them.
\[17]And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set [the battle] in array against them. And David put the battle in array against the Syrians, and they fought with him.
\[18]And the Syrians fled from before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand [in] chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and slew Shophach the captain of the host.

\[2]And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was [set] upon David's head: and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
\[3]And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with the saw, and with harrows of iron, and with saws. And so David did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
\[4]And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; then Sibbechai the Hushathite smote Sippai, one of the children of Rapha; and they were subdued.
\[5]And there was again a battle with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair smote Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite; now the shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam.
\[6]And there was again a battle, at Gath; and there was a man [there] of great stature, whose fingers [and toes] were four and twenty, six [on each hand], and six [on each foot]; and he also was born to Rapha.

\[2]And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.
\[3]And Joab said, Jehovah add to his people, how many soever they be, a hundredfold: are they not all, my lord O king, my lord's servants? why does my lord require this thing? why should he become a trespass to Israel?
\[4]But the king's word prevailed against Joab; and Joab departed, and went through all Israel, and came [again] to Jerusalem.
\[5]And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David. And all they of Israel were eleven hundred thousand men that drew sword; and of Judah, four hundred and seventy thousand men that drew sword.
\[6]But Levi and Benjamin he did not count among them; for the king's word was abominable to Joab.
\[7]And God was displeased on account of this thing, and he smote Israel.
\[8]And David said to God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing; and now, I beseech thee, put away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
\[9]And Jehovah spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,
\[10]Go and speak to David saying, Thus saith Jehovah: I offer thee three [things]; choose one of them, that I may do it unto thee.
\[11]And Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah:
\[12]Choose thee, either three years of famine, or three months to be destroyed before thine adversaries while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee, or three days the sword of Jehovah and the pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah destroying through all the borders of Israel. And now consider what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.
\[13]And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray thee, into the hand of Jehovah, for his mercies are very great; but let me not fall into the hand of man.
\[14]And Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
\[15]And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; and as he was destroying, Jehovah beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough; withdraw now thine hand. And the angel of Jehovah stood by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\[16]And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Jehovah stand between the earth and the heavens, and his sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem. And David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.
\[17]And David said to God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? It is I that have sinned and done evil; but these sheep, what have they done? Let thy hand, I pray thee, Jehovah my God, be on me and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be smitten.
\[18]And the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up and rear an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\[19]And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he had spoken in the name of Jehovah.
\[20]And Ornan turned back and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
\[21]And David came to Ornan, and Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with [his] face to the ground.
\[22]And David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of the threshing-floor, that I may build an altar in it to Jehovah: grant it to me for the full money, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
\[23]And Ornan said to David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his sight: see, I give the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing-sledges for wood, and the wheat for the oblation; I give it all.
\[24]And king David said to Ornan, No; but I will in any case buy [them] for the full money; for I will not take that which is thine for Jehovah, to offer up a burnt-offering without cost.
\[25]And David gave to Ornan for the place in shekels of gold the weight of six hundred [shekels].
\[26]And David built there an altar to Jehovah, and offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon Jehovah; and he answered him from the heavens by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering.
\[27]And Jehovah spoke to the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath.
\[28]At that time when David saw that Jehovah had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
\[29]And the tabernacle of Jehovah, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.

\[6]And he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for Jehovah the God of Israel.
\[7]And David said to Solomon, As for me, my son, I was minded to build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God.
\[8]But the word of Jehovah came to me saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build a house unto my name, for thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.
\[9]Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about; for his name shall be Solomon, and in his days I will give peace and quietness unto Israel.
\[10]He shall build a house unto my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.
\[11]Now, my son, Jehovah be with thee, that thou mayest prosper, and build the house of Jehovah thy God, as he has said of thee.
\[12]Only, Jehovah give thee wisdom and understanding, and place thee over Israel, and to keep the law of Jehovah thy God.
\[13]Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to perform the statutes and ordinances which Jehovah commanded Moses for Israel: be strong and courageous; fear not, neither be dismayed.
\[14]And behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight, for it is in abundance; and timber and stone have I prepared; and thou shalt add to it.
\[15]And there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of skilful men for every kind of work.
\[16]Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing and Jehovah be with thee.
\[17]And David commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, [saying,]
\[18]Is not Jehovah your God with you? and has he [not] given you rest on every side? for he has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Jehovah, and before his people.

\[5]and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Jehovah with the instruments which I made, [said David,] to praise [therewith].

\[26]and the Levites also have no more to carry the tabernacle, nor any of its vessels for its service.

\[2]And king David stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren and my people! I had in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and for the footstool of our God, and I have prepared to build.
\[3]But God said to me, Thou shalt not build a house unto my name, for thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood.
\[4]And Jehovah the God of Israel chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever; for he has chosen Judah to be the prince; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel;
\[5]and of all my sons, (for Jehovah has given me many sons,) he has chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of Jehovah over Israel.
\[6]And he said to me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.
\[7]And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be firm to do my commandments and mine ordinances, as at this day.
\[8]And now in the sight of all Israel, the congregation of Jehovah, and in the audience of our God,—keep and seek for all the commandments of Jehovah your God; that ye may possess the good land, and leave it as an inheritance to your children after you for ever.
\[9]And thou, Solomon my son, know the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Jehovah searches all hearts, and discerns all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cut thee off for ever.
\[10]Consider now, that Jehovah has chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do [it].
\[11]And David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of its houses, and of its treasuries, and of its upper chambers, and of its inner chambers, and of the house of the mercy-seat;
\[12]and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, of the courts of the house of Jehovah, and of all the chambers round about, for the treasuries of the house of God, and for the treasuries of the dedicated things;

\[14]gold by weight for [things] of gold, for all utensils of each kind of service; for all utensils of silver, by weight, for all utensils of each kind of service;
\[15]and the weight of the golden candlesticks, and of their golden lamps, by weight for every candlestick, and for its lamps; and for the silver candlesticks, by weight, for the candlestick and for its lamps, according to the use of every candlestick;
\[16]and gold by weight for the tables of the [loaves] to be set in rows, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver;
\[17]and pure gold for the forks, and the bowls, and the goblets; and for the golden basons by weight for every bason; and for the silver basons by weight for every bason;
\[18]and for the altar of incense, refined gold by weight; and the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim of gold, which spread out [their wings] and cover the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.
\[19]All this [said David,] in writing, by Jehovah's hand upon me, instructing as to all the works of the pattern.
\[20]And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and courageous, and do it; fear not nor be dismayed: for Jehovah Elohim, my God, will be with thee; he will not leave thee, neither forsake thee, until all the work for the service of the house of Jehovah is finished.
\[21]And behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites are for all the service of the house of God; and thou hast with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing man, skilful for every sort of service; and the princes and all the people are wholly at thy commandment.

\[3]And moreover, in my affection for the house of my God I have given of my own property of gold and silver, for the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the house of the sanctuary:
\[4]three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses;
\[5]gold for [things of] gold, and silver for [things of] silver, and for all manner of work by the hands of artificers. And who is willing to offer to Jehovah this day?
\[6]And the chief fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and the comptrollers of the king's business, offered willingly.
\[7]And they gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, and ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of brass, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.
\[8]And they with whom stones were found gave [them] to the treasure of the house of Jehovah, into the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
\[9]And the people rejoiced because they offered willingly, for with perfect heart they offered willingly to Jehovah; and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
\[10]And David blessed Jehovah in the sight of all the congregation; and David said, Blessed be thou, Jehovah, the God of our father Israel, for ever and ever.
\[11]Thine, Jehovah, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the splendour, and the majesty; for all that is in the heavens and on the earth is thine: thine, Jehovah, is the kingdom, and thou art exalted as Head above all;
\[12]and riches and glory are of thee, and thou rulest over everything; and in thy hand is power and might; and in thy hand it is to make all great and strong.
\[13]And now, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.
\[14]But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer willingly after this manner? for all is of thee, and of that which is from thy hand have we given thee.
\[15]For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no hope [of life].
\[16]Jehovah our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house to thy holy name, is of thy hand, and is all thine own.
\[17]And I know, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart have I willingly offered all these things; and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, offer willingly to thee.
\[18]Jehovah, God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and direct their hearts to thee!
\[19]And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.
\[20]And David said to all the congregation, Bless now Jehovah your God. And all the congregation blessed Jehovah the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and did homage to Jehovah and the king.
\[21]And they sacrificed sacrifices to Jehovah, and offered up burnt-offerings to Jehovah, on the morrow after that day: a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
\[22]And they ate and drank before Jehovah on that day with great joy. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him to Jehovah to be prince, and Zadok to be priest.
\[23]And Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.
\[24]And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king.
\[25]And Jehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him royal majesty such as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
\[26]Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
\[27]And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years: he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
\[28]And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour; and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
\[29]And the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer;

\[2]And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to all the princes of all Israel, the chief fathers;
\[3]and Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place at Gibeon; for there was God's tent of meeting which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness.
\[4]But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-jearim to the [place] that David had prepared for it; for he had spread a tent for it at Jerusalem.
\[5]And the brazen altar that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Jehovah; and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.
\[6]And Solomon offered there upon the brazen altar before Jehovah which was at the tent of meeting; and he offered up a thousand burnt-offerings upon it.
\[7]In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give thee.
\[8]And Solomon said to God, Thou hast shewn unto David my father great loving-kindness, and hast made me king in his stead.
\[9]Now, Jehovah Elohim, let thy word unto David my father be firm; for thou hast made me king over a people numerous as the dust of the earth.
\[10]Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this thy great people?
\[11]And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of them that hate thee, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked for thyself wisdom and knowledge, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:
\[12]wisdom and knowledge are granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches and wealth and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall any after thee have the like.
\[13]Then Solomon came back [from] the high place at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tent of meeting, and reigned over Israel.
\[14]And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; and he had a thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen; and he placed them in the chariot-cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\[15]And the king made silver and gold in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he as the sycamores that are in the lowland for abundance.
\[16]And the exportation of horses that Solomon had was from Egypt: a caravan of the king's merchants fetched a drove [of horses], at a price.
\[17]And they fetched up and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so they brought [them] by their means, for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Syria.

\[3]And Solomon sent to Huram king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein [so do for me].
\[4]Behold, I build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God to dedicate it to him, to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual arrangement [of the shewbread], and for the morning and evening burnt-offerings [and] on the sabbaths and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God. This is [an ordinance] for ever to Israel.
\[5]And the house that I will build is great; for great is our God above all gods.
\[6]But who is able to build him a house, seeing the heavens and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? And who am I that I should build him a house, except to burn sacrifice before him?
\[7]And now send me a man skilful to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in iron, and in purple and crimson and blue, and experienced in carving, besides the skilful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.
\[8]Send me also cedar-trees, cypress-trees, and sandal-wood trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants are experienced in cutting timber in Lebanon; and behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,
\[9]even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house that I build shall be great and wonderful.
\[10]And behold, I will give to thy servants the hewers that fell timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
\[11]And Huram king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Jehovah loved his people, he made thee king over them.
\[12]And Huram said, Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, that made the heavens and the earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, who will build a house for Jehovah and a house for his kingdom.
\[13]And now, I send a skilful man, endued with understanding, Huram Abi,

\[5]And the greater house he boarded with cypress-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set on it palm-trees and chains.
\[6]And he overlaid the house with precious stones for beauty; and the gold was gold of Parvaim.
\[7]And he covered the house, the beams, the threshold, and its walls, and its doors with gold, and engraved cherubim on the walls.
\[8]And he made the house of the most holy place, the length of which was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits; and he covered it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.
\[9]And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he covered the upper chambers with gold.
\[10]And in the house of the most holy place he made two cherubim of image work, and they overlaid them with gold.
\[11]And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: one wing of five cubits touched the wall of the house; and the other wing of five cubits touched the wing of the other cherub.
\[12]And the wing of the other cherub of five cubits touched the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits joining the wing of the other cherub.
\[13]The wings of these cherubim spread forth were twenty cubits; and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house.
\[14]And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and byssus, and made cherubim upon it.
\[15]And before the house he made two pillars thirty-five cubits long; and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.
\[16]And he made chains [as] in the oracle, and he put them on the top of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.

\[7]And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance respecting them, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand and five on the left.
\[8]And he made ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right hand and five on the left. And he made a hundred golden bowls.

\[15]one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.

\[6]And king Solomon, and all the assembly of Israel, that were assembled to him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen which could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.
\[7]And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim;
\[8]and the cherubim stretched forth [their] wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its staves above.

\[13]—it came to pass when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one voice to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah; and when they lifted up their voice with trumpets, and cymbals, and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah: For he is good, for his loving-kindness [endureth] for ever; that then the house, the house of Jehovah, was filled with a cloud,

\[5]Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel:
\[6]but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
\[7]And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house unto the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
\[8]But Jehovah said to David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart;
\[9]nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.
\[10]And Jehovah has performed his word which he spoke; and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and I have built the house unto the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
\[11]And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with the children of Israel.
\[12]And he stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of the whole congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands.
\[13]For Solomon had made a platform of bronze, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood, and he kneeled down on his knees before the whole congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward the heavens,
\[14]and said, Jehovah, God of Israel! there is no God like thee, in the heavens or on the earth, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart;
\[15]who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him; thou spokest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled [it] with thy hand as at this day.
\[16]And now, Jehovah, God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy sons take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.
\[17]And now, Jehovah, God of Israel, let thy word be verified which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.
\[18]But will God indeed dwell with man on the earth? behold, the heavens and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!
\[19]Yet have respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, Jehovah, my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee;
\[20]that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place in which thou hast said thou wouldest put thy name: to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place.
\[21]And hearken unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall pray toward this place, and hear thou from thy dwelling-place, from the heavens, and when thou hearest, forgive.
\[22]If a man have sinned against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to adjure him, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;
\[23]then hear thou from the heavens, and do, and judge thy servants, requiting the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, giving him according to his righteousness.
\[24]And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication before thee in this house;
\[25]then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land that thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
\[26]When the heavens are shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, because thou hast afflicted them;
\[27]then hear thou in the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
\[28]If there be famine in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blight or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their gates; whatever plague or whatever sickness there be:
\[29]what prayer, what supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, when they shall know every man his own plague, and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house;
\[30]then hear thou from the heavens, the settled place of thy dwelling, and forgive, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest (for thou, thou only, knowest the hearts of the children of men),
\[31]that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, all the days that they live upon the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.
\[32]And as to the stranger also, who is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand and thy stretched-out arm; when they shall come and pray toward this house,
\[33]then hear thou from the heavens, the settled place of thy dwelling, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; in order that all peoples of the earth may know thy name, and may fear thee as do thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
\[34]If thy people go out to battle against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city that thou hast chosen, and the house that I have built unto thy name;
\[35]then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their right.
\[36]If they have sinned against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and give them up to the enemy, and they have carried them away captives unto a land far off or near;
\[37]and if they shall take it to heart in the land whither they were carried captive, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done iniquity and have dealt perversely;
\[38]and if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers, and the city that thou hast chosen, and the house that I have built unto thy name;
\[39]then hear thou from the heavens, from the settled place of thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their right, and forgive thy people their sin against thee.
\[40]Now, my God, I beseech thee, let thine eyes be open and let thine ears be attentive unto the prayer [that is made] in this place.
\[41]And now, arise, Jehovah Elohim, into thy resting-place, thou and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, Jehovah Elohim, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in [thy] goodness.
\[42]Jehovah Elohim, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember mercies to David thy servant.

\[2]And the priests could not enter into the house of Jehovah, because the glory of Jehovah filled Jehovah's house.
\[3]And all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of Jehovah upon the house, and bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worshipped and thanked Jehovah: For he is good, for his loving-kindness [endureth] for ever.
\[4]And the king and all the people offered sacrifices before Jehovah.
\[5]And king Solomon sacrificed a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
\[6]And the priests stood in their charges, and the Levites with Jehovah's instruments of music, which David the king had made to praise Jehovah, for his loving-kindness [endureth] for ever, when David praised by their means; and the priests sounded the trumpets opposite to them, and all Israel stood.
\[7]And Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offerings and the oblations and the fat.
\[8]And at that time Solomon held the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entrance of Hamath unto the torrent of Egypt.
\[9]And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly; for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.
\[10]And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Jehovah had done to David and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.
\[11]And Solomon completed the house of Jehovah, and the king's house; and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he did prosperously.
\[12]Then Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him: I have heard thy prayer, and I have chosen for myself this place for a house of sacrifice.
\[13]If I shut up the heavens that there be no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;
\[14]and my people, who are called by my name, humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from the heavens, and forgive their sin, and heal their land.
\[15]Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attentive to the prayer [made] in this place;
\[16]for I have now chosen and hallowed this house, that my name may be there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
\[17]And [as for] thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances;
\[18]then will I establish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to rule over Israel.
\[19]But if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them;
\[20]then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed to my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
\[21]And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passes by it; so that he shall say, Why has Jehovah done thus to this land and to this house?
\[22]And they shall say, Because they forsook Jehovah the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and have attached themselves to other gods, and have worshipped them and served them; therefore he has brought upon them all this evil.

\[2]that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
\[3]And Solomon went to Hamath-Zobah, and overcame it.
\[4]And he built Tadmor, in the wilderness, and all the store-cities, which he built in Hamath.
\[5]And he built upper Beth-Horon and lower Beth-Horon, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;
\[6]and Baalath, and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for chariots, and the cities for the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and on Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
\[7]All the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel,
\[8]their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel had not destroyed, upon them did Solomon impose tribute-service until this day.
\[9]But of the children of Israel, of them did Solomon make no bondmen for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and his horsemen.
\[10]And these were the chief of king Solomon's superintendents, two hundred and fifty, that ruled over the people.
\[11]And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David to the house which he had built for her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the [places] are holy to which the ark of Jehovah has come.
\[12]Then Solomon offered up burnt-offerings to Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah, which he had built before the porch;
\[13]even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and at the set feasts, three times in the year,—at the feast of unleavened bread, and at the feast of weeks, and at the feast of tabernacles.
\[14]And he appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their charges, to praise and serve before the priests, as the duty of every day required; and the doorkeepers by their divisions at every gate: for such was the commandment of David the man of God;
\[15]and they did not depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and the Levites concerning any matter, nor concerning the treasures.
\[16]And all the work of Solomon was prepared, to the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah and to its completion. [So] the house of Jehovah was finished.
\[17]Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom.
\[18]And Huram sent him by his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.

\[2]And Solomon explained to her all she spoke of, and there was not a thing hidden from Solomon that he did not explain to her.
\[3]And when the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
\[4]and the food of his table, and the deportment of his servants, and the order of service of his attendants and their apparel, and his cupbearers and their apparel, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Jehovah, there was no more spirit in her.
\[5]And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine affairs and of thy wisdom;
\[6]but I gave no credit to their words, until I came and mine eyes had seen; and behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: thou exceedest the report that I heard.
\[7]Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom!
\[8]Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on his throne, to be king to Jehovah thy God! Because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore did he make thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.
\[9]And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in very great abundance, and precious stones; neither was there any such spice as that which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
\[10](And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought sandal-wood and precious stones.
\[11]And the king made of the sandal-wood stairs for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, and harps and lutes for the singers. And there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.)
\[12]And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides what she had brought to the king. And she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants.
\[13]And the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,
\[14]besides [what] dealers and merchants brought, and [what] all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought of gold and silver to Solomon.
\[15]And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold,—he applied six hundred [shekels] of beaten gold to one target;
\[16]and three hundred shields of beaten gold,—he applied three hundred [shekels] of gold to one shield; and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
\[17]And the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold;
\[18]and the throne had six steps, with a footstool of gold fastened to the throne; and there were arms on each side at the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the arms;
\[19]and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
\[20]And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of precious gold: silver was not of the least account in the days of Solomon.
\[21]For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: once in three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
\[22]And king Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
\[23]And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
\[24]And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and clothing, armour, and spices, horses and mules, a rate year by year.
\[25]And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he placed them in the chariot-cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\[26]And he ruled over all the kings from the river as far as the land of the Philistines, and up to the border of Egypt.
\[27]And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he as the sycamores that are in the lowland for abundance.
\[28]And they brought to Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.

\[3]And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam saying,
\[4]Thy father made our yoke grievous; and now lighten the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
\[5]And he said to them, Come again to me after three days. And the people departed.
\[6]And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, How do ye advise to return answer to this people?
\[7]And they spoke to him saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.
\[8]But he forsook the advice of the old men which they had given him, and consulted with the young men, who had grown up with him, that stood before him.
\[9]And he said to them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me saying, Lighten the yoke which thy father put upon us?
\[10]And the young men that had grown up with him spoke to him saying, Thus shalt thou say to the people who have spoken to thee saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, and lighten thou it for us,—thus shalt thou say to them: My little [finger] is thicker than my father's loins;
\[11]and whereas my father laid a heavy yoke upon you, *I* will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but *I* [will chastise you] with scorpions.
\[12]And Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed saying, Come again to me on the third day.
\[13]And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the advice of the old men,
\[14]and spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but *I* will add to it; my father chastised you with whips, but *I* [will chastise you] with scorpions.
\[15]So the king hearkened not to the people; for it was brought about by God, that Jehovah might give effect to his word, which he spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\[16]And all Israel saw that the king hearkened not to them; and the people answered the king saying, What portion have we in David? and [we have] no inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel. Now see to thine own house, David! And all Israel went to their tents.
\[17]But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
\[18]And king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the levy; but the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. And king Rehoboam hastened to mount his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.

\[3]Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
\[4]Thus saith Jehovah: Go not up, nor fight with your brethren; return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. And they hearkened to the words of Jehovah, and returned from going against Jeroboam.

\[3]with twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen; and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt: Libyans, Sukkites, and Ethiopians.
\[4]And he took the fortified cities that belonged to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.
\[5]And Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and [to] the princes of Judah that had gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus saith Jehovah: Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
\[6]And the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, Jehovah is righteous.
\[7]And when Jehovah saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves: I will not destroy them, but I will grant them a little deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
\[8]Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
\[9]And Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house; he took away all; and he took away the shields of gold that Solomon had made.

\[3]And Abijah began the war with an army of men of war, four hundred thousand chosen men; and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, mighty men of valour.
\[4]And Abijah stood up on the top of mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, Jeroboam, and all Israel!
\[5]Ought ye not to know that Jehovah the God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, to him and to his sons [by] a covenant of salt?
\[6]But Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord.
\[7]And vain men, sons of Belial, gathered to him and strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, and Rehoboam was young and faint-hearted, and did not shew himself strong against them.
\[8]And now ye think to shew yourselves strong against the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and ye have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made you for gods.
\[9]Have ye not cast out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests as the peoples of the lands? whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, he becomes a priest of what is not God.
\[10]But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests that serve Jehovah are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites are at their work:
\[11]and they burn to Jehovah every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense; the loaves also are set in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with its lamps to burn every evening: for *we* keep the charge of Jehovah our God; but *ye* have forsaken him.
\[12]And behold, we have God with us at our head, and his priests, and the loud-sounding trumpets to sound an alarm against you. Children of Israel, do not fight with Jehovah the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.
\[13]But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them; and they were before Judah, and the ambush behind them.
\[14]And Judah looked back, and behold, they had the battle in front and behind; and they cried to Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
\[15]And the men of Judah gave a shout; and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
\[16]And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.
\[17]And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter; and there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
\[18]And the children of Israel were humbled at that time, and the children of Judah were strengthened, because they relied upon Jehovah the God of their fathers.
\[19]And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him: Bethel with its dependent villages, and Jeshanah with its dependent villages, and Ephron with its dependent villages.

\[2]And Asa did what was good and right in the sight of Jehovah his God;
\[3]and he took away the altars of the strange [gods] and the high places, and broke the columns, and cut down the Asherahs;
\[4]and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers, and to practise the law and the commandment.
\[5]And he removed out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images; and the kingdom was quiet before him.
\[6]And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because Jehovah had given him rest.
\[7]And he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars, while the land is yet before us; for we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. And they built and prospered.
\[8]And Asa had an army that bore targets and spears: out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew the bow, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these, mighty men of valour.
\[9]And Zerah the Ethiopian came out against him with a host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah.
\[10]And Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.
\[11]And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, it maketh no difference to thee to help, whether there be much or no power: help us, O Jehovah our God, for we rely on thee, and in thy name have we come against this multitude. Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.
\[12]And Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.
\[13]And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them to Gerar; and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that none of them was left alive; for they were crushed before Jehovah and before his army. And they carried away very much spoil.
\[14]And they smote all the cities round about Gerar, for the terror of Jehovah came upon them; and they spoiled all the cities, for there was very much spoil in them.

\[3]Now for a long while Israel [was] without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law;
\[4]but in their trouble they turned to Jehovah the God of Israel, and sought him, and he was found of them.
\[5]And in those times there [was] no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in, but great disturbances were amongst all the inhabitants of the countries.
\[6]And nation was broken against nation, and city against city; for God disturbed them with all manner of distress.
\[7]But as for you, be firm and let not your hands be weak; for there is a reward for your deeds.
\[8]And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities that he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of Jehovah, that was before the porch of Jehovah.
\[9]And he assembled all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon; for they fell away to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him.
\[10]And they assembled themselves at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
\[11]And they sacrificed to Jehovah in that day, of the spoil that they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
\[12]And they entered into a covenant to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers, with all their heart, and with all their soul,
\[13]and that whoever would not seek Jehovah the God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
\[14]And they swore to Jehovah with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
\[15]And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they took the oath with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them. And Jehovah gave them rest round about.
\[16]And also Maachah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol for the Asherah; and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burned it in the valley Kidron.

\[3]There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I send thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
\[4]And Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his forces against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon and Dan and Abelmaim, and all the store-magazines of the cities of Naphtali.

\[8]Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a huge army, with very many chariots and horsemen? but when thou didst rely on Jehovah, he delivered them into thy hand.

\[6]But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we might inquire of him?
\[7]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah; but I hate him, for he prophesies no good concerning me, but always evil: [it is] Micah the son of Imlah. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
\[8]Then the king of Israel called a chamberlain, and said, Fetch quickly Micah the son of Imlah.

\[11]And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-Gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will give it into the king's hand.
\[12]And the messenger that went to call Micah spoke to him saying, Behold, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one assent: let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and declare good.
\[13]And Micah said, As Jehovah liveth, even what my God shall say, that will I declare.

\[15]and thyself with sore sicknesses, with a disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.

\[17]and they came up into Judah, and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was no son left him, except Jehoahaz the youngest of his sons.

\[12]and he was with them hid in the house of God six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land.

nd in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of the hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.
\[2]And they went about in Judah and gathered together the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief fathers of Israel; and they came to Jerusalem.
\[3]And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as Jehovah has said of the sons of David.
\[4]This is the thing which ye shall do: a third part of you that come in on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be keepers of the doors;
\[5]and a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation; and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of Jehovah.
\[6]But let none come into the house of Jehovah except the priests and those of the Levites that do the service; they shall go in, for they are holy; but all the people shall keep the watch of Jehovah.
\[7]And the Levites shall encompass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he that comes into the house shall be put to death; and ye shall be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.
\[8]And the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go forth on the sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest did not liberate the divisions.
\[9]And Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of the hundreds king David's spears and shields and targets, which were in the house of God.
\[10]And he set all the people, every man with his javelin in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, toward the altar and the house, by the king round about.
\[11]And they brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and [gave him] the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, Long live the king!
\[12]And Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, and she came to the people into the house of Jehovah.
\[13]And she looked, and behold, the king stood on his dais at the entrance, and the princes and the trumpets were by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets; and the singers [were there] with the instruments of music, and such as taught to sing praise. And Athaliah rent her garments, and said, Conspiracy! Conspiracy!
\[14]And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of the hundreds that were set over the host, and said to them, Lead her forth without the ranks; and whosoever follows her, let him be slain with the sword; for the priest said, Ye shall not put her to death in the house of Jehovah.
\[15]And they made way for her, and she went through the entrance of the horse-gate into the king's house, and they put her to death there.
\[16]And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king, that they should be the people of Jehovah.
\[17]And all the people went into the house of Baal, and broke it down; and they broke his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
\[18]And Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of Jehovah under the hand of the priests, the Levites, whom David had set by classes over the house of Jehovah to offer up Jehovah's burnt-offerings, as it is written in the law of Moses,—with rejoicing and with singing according to the directions of David.
\[19]And he set the doorkeepers at the gates of the house of Jehovah, that no one unclean in anything should enter in.
\[20]And he took the captains of the hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of Jehovah; and they came through the upper gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.
\[21]And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet; and they had slain Athaliah with the sword.

oash was seven years old when he began to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
\[2]And Joash did what was right in the sight of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
\[3]And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begot sons and daughters.
\[4]And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to renew the house of Jehovah.
\[5]And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah and collect of all Israel money for the repair of the house of your God from year to year, and ye shall hasten the matter. But the Levites hastened it not.
\[6]And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tribute of Moses the servant of Jehovah [laid upon] the congregation of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?
\[7]For the wicked Athaliah [and] her sons had devastated the house of God; and also all the hallowed things of the house of Jehovah had they employed for the Baals.
\[8]And the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it at the gate of the house of Jehovah without,
\[9]and they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring to Jehovah the tribute of Moses the servant of God [laid upon] Israel in the wilderness.
\[10]And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in and cast into the chest, until they had finished.
\[11]And it came to pass at the time the chest was brought for the king's control by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and high priest's officer came, and they emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.
\[12]And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and they hired masons and carpenters to renew the house of Jehovah, and also such as wrought in iron and bronze, to repair the house of Jehovah.
\[13]So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in its state, and strengthened it.
\[14]And when they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada; and they made of it vessels for the house of Jehovah, utensils to minister, and with which to offer up, and cups, and utensils of gold and silver. And they offered up burnt-offerings in the house of Jehovah continually all the days of Jehoiada.
\[15]And Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died; he was a hundred and thirty years old when he died.
\[16]And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God and toward his house.
\[17]And after the death of Jehoiada the princes of Judah came and made obeisance to the king; then the king hearkened to them.
\[18]And they forsook the house of Jehovah the God of their fathers, and served the Asherahs and idols; and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.
\[19]And he sent prophets among them to bring them again to Jehovah, and they testified against them; but they would not give ear.
\[20]And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood up above the people and said unto them, Thus saith God: Wherefore do ye transgress the commandments of Jehovah? And ye cannot prosper; for ye have forsaken Jehovah, and he hath forsaken you.
\[21]And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the command of the king in the court of the house of Jehovah.
\[22]And king Joash remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, Jehovah see and require [it]!
\[23]And it came to pass at the end of the year [that] the army of Syria came up against him; and they entered into Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them to the king at Damascus.
\[24]Truly with a small company of men came the army of the Syrians, but Jehovah delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken Jehovah the God of their fathers; and they executed judgment upon Joash.
\[25]And when they had departed from him (for they left him in great diseases), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the sepulchres of the kings.
\[26]And these are they that conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.
\[27]And as to his sons, and the greatness of the burdens [laid] upon him, and the building of the house of God, behold, they are written in the treatise of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

maziah was twenty-five years old [when] he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
\[2]And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, yet not with a perfect heart.
\[3]And it came to pass when the kingdom was established unto him, that he killed his servants who had smitten the king his father.
\[4]But their children he did not put to death, but [did] according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, wherein Jehovah commanded saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, nor shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.
\[5]And Amaziah gathered Judah together and arranged them according to the fathers' houses, according to the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, throughout Judah and Benjamin; and he numbered them from twenty years old and upwards, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able for military service, that could handle spear and target.
\[6]He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
\[7]But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the host of Israel go with thee; for Jehovah is not with Israel, [with] all the children of Ephraim.
\[8]But if thou wilt go, do [it]; be strong for the battle: God will make thee fall before the enemy, for there is with God power to help and to cast down.
\[9]And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what is to be done for the hundred talents which I have given to the troop of Israel? And the man of God said, Jehovah is able to give thee much more than this.
\[10]Then Amaziah separated them,—the troop that was come to him out of Ephraim,—to go home again. And their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.
\[11]But Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.
\[12]And the children of Judah took ten thousand captive, alive, and brought them to the top of the cliff, and cast them down from the top of the cliff, so that they all were broken in pieces.
\[13]But those of the troop that Amaziah had sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah from Samaria as far as Beth-horon, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.
\[14]And it came to pass after Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed himself down before them, and burned incense to them.
\[15]And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, Why dost thou seek after the gods of a people who have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?
\[16]And it came to pass as he talked with him, that [Amaziah] said to him, Hast thou been made the king's counsellor? Forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbore, and said, I know that God has determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened to my counsel.
\[17]And Amaziah king of Judah took counsel, and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
\[18]And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thorn-bush that is in Lebanon sent to the cedar that is in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son as wife; and there passed by the wild beast that is in Lebanon, and trode down the thorn-bush.
\[19]Thou thinkest, Lo, thou hast smitten Edom; and thy heart has lifted thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou contend with misfortune, that thou shouldest fall, thou and Judah with thee?
\[20]But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into [the enemy's] hand, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.
\[21]And Joash king of Israel went up; and they looked one another in the face, he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth-shemesh, which is in Judah.
\[22]And Judah was routed before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.
\[23]And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and he broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
\[24]And he [took] all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the king's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.
\[25]And Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, fifteen years.
\[26]And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
\[27]And from the time that Amaziah turned aside from following Jehovah, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish; and they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
\[28]And they brought him on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.

nd all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.
\[2]It was he that built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
\[3]Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.
\[4]And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
\[5]And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God; and in the days that he sought Jehovah, God made him to prosper.
\[6]And he went forth and fought against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
\[7]And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-Baal, and the Maonites.
\[8]And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad to the entrance of Egypt; for he became exceeding strong.
\[9]And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the angle, and fortified them.
\[10]And he built towers in the desert and digged many cisterns; for he had much cattle, both in the lowland and on the plateau, husbandmen [also] and vinedressers on the mountains and in Carmel; for he loved husbandry.
\[11]And Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.
\[12]The whole number of the chief fathers of the mighty men of valour was two thousand six hundred.
\[13]And under their hand was an army-host of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred, that made war with mighty power to help the king against the enemy.
\[14]And Uzziah prepared for them, throughout the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and even slinging-stones.
\[15]And he made in Jerusalem machines invented by skilful men, to be upon the towers and upon the bulwarks, wherewith to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he became strong.
\[16]But when he became strong his heart was lifted up to [his] downfall; and he transgressed against Jehovah his God, and went into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
\[17]And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him priests of Jehovah, eighty valiant men;
\[18]and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said to him, It is not for thee, Uzziah, to burn incense to Jehovah, but for the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast transgressed; neither shall it be for thine honour from Jehovah Elohim.
\[19]And Uzziah was wroth; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of Jehovah, beside the incense altar.
\[20]And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; even he himself hasted to go out, because Jehovah had smitten him.
\[21]And Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of Jehovah. And Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.
\[22]And the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz write.
\[23]And Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the burial-ground of the kings, for they said, He is a leper. And Jotham his son reigned in his stead.

\[3]and he burned incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burned his sons in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed from before the children of Israel.
\[4]And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
\[5]Therefore Jehovah his God gave him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.
\[6]And Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all valiant men, because they had forsaken Jehovah the God of their fathers.
\[7]And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah the second to the king.
\[8]And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took away also much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
\[9]But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because Jehovah the God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he gave them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reaches up to heaven.
\[10]And now ye think to subjugate the children of Judah and Jerusalem as your bondmen and bondwomen. Are there not with you, even with you, trespasses against Jehovah your God?
\[11]And now hear me, and send back the captives again, whom ye have taken captive of your brethren; for the fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you.
\[12]And certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Hezekiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,
\[13]and said to them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither; because, for our guilt before Jehovah, ye think to increase our sins and our trespasses: for our trespass is great, and fierce wrath is upon Israel.
\[14]Then the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.
\[15]And the men that have been expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them on asses, and brought them to Jericho the city of palm-trees, to their brethren. And they returned to Samaria.
\[16]At that time king Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him.
\[17]And again the Edomites came and smote Judah, and carried away captives.
\[18]And the Philistines invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the south of Judah, and took Beth-shemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Socho and its dependent villages, and Timnah and its dependent villages, and Guimzo and its dependent villages; and they dwelt there.
\[19]For Jehovah humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had made Judah lawless, and transgressed much against Jehovah.
\[20]And Tilgath-Pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and troubled him, and did not support him.
\[21]For Ahaz stripped the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king and of the princes, and gave to the king of Assyria; but he was of no help to him.
\[22]And in the time of his trouble he transgressed yet more against Jehovah, this king Ahaz.
\[23]And he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which had smitten him; and he said, Since the gods of the kings of Syria help them, I will sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
\[24]And Ahaz gathered the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and closed the doors of the house of Jehovah, and he made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
\[25]And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah the God of his fathers.

\[3]He, in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired them.
\[4]And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them into the open place eastward;
\[5]and he said to them, Hear me, ye Levites: hallow yourselves now, and hallow the house of Jehovah the God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the sanctuary.
\[6]For our fathers have transgressed, and done evil in the sight of Jehovah our God, and have forsaken him and turned away their faces from the habitation of Jehovah, and have turned their backs.
\[7]Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered up burnt-offerings in the sanctuary to the God of Israel.
\[8]Therefore the wrath of Jehovah has been upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he has delivered them to vexation, to desolation, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.
\[9]And behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
\[10]Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Jehovah the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us.
\[11]My sons, be not now negligent; for Jehovah has chosen you to stand before him, to do service unto him, and to be his ministers and incense-burners.

\[13]and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
\[14]and of the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
\[15]And they gathered their brethren, and hallowed themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.
\[16]And the priests went into the inner part of the house of Jehovah to cleanse it, and carried forth all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah, into the court of the house of Jehovah. And the Levites took it to carry it forth into the brook Kidron.
\[17]And they began on the first of the first month to hallow, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of Jehovah; and they hallowed the house of Jehovah eight days; and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
\[18]And they went in to king Hezekiah, and said, We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the table of the [bread] to be set in rows, and all its vessels;
\[19]and all the vessels that king Ahaz in his reign cast away in his transgression have we prepared and hallowed, and behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah.
\[20]And Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah.
\[21]And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats for a sin-offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer [them] upon the altar of Jehovah.
\[22]And they slaughtered the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar; and they slaughtered the rams, and sprinkled the blood on the altar; and they slaughtered the lambs, and sprinkled the blood on the altar.
\[23]And they brought near the he-goats of the sin-offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them.
\[24]And the priests slaughtered them, and they made purification for sin with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel; because for all Israel, said the king, is the burnt-offering and the sin-offering.
\[25]And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with lutes, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of Jehovah through his prophets.
\[26]And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
\[27]And Hezekiah commanded to offer up the burnt-offering on the altar. And at the moment the burnt-offering began, the song of Jehovah began, and the trumpets, accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel.
\[28]And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded, all [the time] until the burnt-offering was finished.
\[29]And when they had ended offering the burnt-offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped.
\[30]And king Hezekiah and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise to Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and bowed their heads and worshipped.
\[31]And Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves to Jehovah, come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of the Lord. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart, burnt-offerings.
\[32]And the number of the burnt-offerings, which the congregation brought, was seventy bullocks, a hundred rams, two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.
\[33]And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
\[34]Only the priests were too few, and they could not flay all the burnt-offerings; therefore their brethren the Levites helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests had hallowed themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to hallow themselves than the priests.
\[35]And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and with the drink-offerings for the burnt-offering. And the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order.
\[36]And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people; for the thing was done suddenly.

nd Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to hold the passover to Jehovah the God of Israel.
\[2]And the king took counsel, and his princes, and the whole congregation in Jerusalem, to hold the passover in the second month.
\[3]For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not hallowed themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people been gathered together to Jerusalem.
\[4]And the thing pleased the king and the whole congregation.
\[5]So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to hold the passover to Jehovah the God of Israel, at Jerusalem; because they had not held it for a long time as it was written.
\[6]And the couriers went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, return to Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.
\[7]And be not like your fathers and like your brethren, who transgressed against Jehovah the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as ye see.
\[8]Now, harden not your necks, as your fathers; yield yourselves to Jehovah, and come to his sanctuary, which he has sanctified for ever; and serve Jehovah your God, that the fierceness of his anger may turn away from you.
\[9]For if ye return to Jehovah, your brethren and your children shall find compassion with those that have carried them captive, so that they shall come again unto this land; for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return to him.
\[10]And the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun; but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them.
\[11]Nevertheless certain of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
\[12]The hand of God was also upon Judah to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of Jehovah.
\[13]And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to hold the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.
\[14]And they rose up and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem; and they took away all the incense-altars, and cast them into the torrent Kidron.
\[15]And they slaughtered the passover on the fourteenth of the second month; and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and hallowed themselves; and they brought the burnt-offerings into the house of Jehovah.
\[16]And they stood in their place after their custom, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood [receiving it] from the hand of the Levites.
\[17]For there were many in the congregation that were not hallowed; therefore the Levites had the charge of the slaughtering of the passover-lambs for every one not clean, to hallow them unto Jehovah.
\[18]For a multitude of the people, many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, and they ate the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them saying, Jehovah, who is good, forgive every one
\[19]that has directed his heart to seek God, Jehovah the God of his fathers, although not according to the purification of the sanctuary.
\[20]And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
\[21]And the children of Israel, that were present at Jerusalem, held the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by day, with the instruments of praise to Jehovah.
\[22]And Hezekiah spoke consolingly to all the Levites that had understanding in the good knowledge of Jehovah; and they ate the feast-offerings the seven days, sacrificing peace-offerings, and extolling Jehovah the God of their fathers.
\[23]And the whole congregation took counsel to observe other seven days; and they observed the seven days with gladness.
\[24]For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the congregation as heave-offering: a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests hallowed themselves.
\[25]And the whole congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
\[26]And there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there had not been the like in Jerusalem.
\[27]And the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people; and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, to the heavens.

nd when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke the columns, and hewed down the Asherahs, and demolished the high places and the altars in all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. And all the children of Israel returned every man to his possession, into their cities.
\[2]And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests, and the Levites after their divisions, every man according to his service, as well the priests as the Levites, for burnt-offerings and for peace-offerings, to serve and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the courts of Jehovah.
\[3]And [he ordered] that the king's portion [should be taken] from his substance for the burnt-offerings: for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, for the burnt-offerings of the sabbaths, and of the new moons, and of the set feasts, as it is written in the law of Jehovah.
\[4]And he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of Jehovah.
\[5]And as soon as the commandment was published, the children of Israel gave in abundance the firstfruits of corn, new wine and oil and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of all [things].
\[6]And the children of Israel and of Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to Jehovah their God, and laid them by heaps.
\[7]In the third month they began to lay the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
\[8]And Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, and they blessed Jehovah, and his people Israel.
\[9]And Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
\[10]And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok spoke to him and said, Since they began to bring the heave-offerings into the house of Jehovah, we have eaten and been satisfied and have left plenty; for Jehovah has blessed his people; and what is left is this great store.
\[11]And Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Jehovah; and they prepared [them],
\[12]and brought in the heave-offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully; and over these Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second.
\[13]And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Jismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the command of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.
\[14]And Kore the son of Jimnah the Levite, the doorkeeper toward the east, was over the voluntary-offerings of God, to distribute the heave-offerings of Jehovah, and the most holy things.
\[15]And under him were Eden and Miniamin and Jeshua and Shemaiah, Amariah and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in [their] set trust, to make distributions to their brethren by [their] divisions, to the great as to the small,
\[16]besides those from three years old and upward who as males were entered in the genealogical register,—all that came into the house of Jehovah, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their charges, according to their divisions,
\[17]—both to the priests enregistered according to their fathers' houses, and to the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges, by their divisions;
\[18]and to all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, the whole congregation of those entered in the register; for in their trust they hallowed themselves to be holy.
\[19]And for the sons of Aaron the priests who were in the country, in the suburbs of their cities, there were, in every several city, men expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all the Levites that were entered in the register.
\[20]And thus did Hezekiah throughout Judah, and wrought what was good and right and true before Jehovah his God.
\[21]And in every work that he undertook in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart and prospered.

fter these things and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to break into them.
\[2]And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was minded to fight against Jerusalem,
\[3]he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the fountains of waters that were outside the city; and they helped him.
\[4]And there was gathered together much people, and they stopped all the fountains, and the torrent that flows through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?
\[5]And he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, and [built] another wall outside, and fortified the Millo of the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.
\[6]And he set captains of war over the people, and assembled them to him on the open place at the gate of the city, and spoke consolingly to them saying,
\[7]Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him; for there are more with us than with him:
\[8]with him is an arm of flesh, but with us is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles. And the people depended upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
\[9]After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem (but he himself was before Lachish, and all his power with him), unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,
\[10]Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria: On what do ye rely that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?
\[11]Does not Hezekiah persuade you, to give yourselves over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\[12]Has not the same Hezekiah removed his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem saying, Ye shall worship before *one* altar, and burn incense upon it?
\[13]Do ye not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the countries? Were the gods of the nations of the countries in any wise able to deliver their country out of my hand?
\[14]Who is there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers have utterly destroyed, that was able to deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?
\[15]And now, let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you in this manner, neither yet believe him; for no +god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, nor out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?
\[16]And his servants spoke yet more against Jehovah, the [true] God, and against his servant Hezekiah.
\[17]And he wrote a letter to rail at Jehovah the God of Israel, and to speak against him saying, As the gods of the nations of the countries have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand.
\[18]And they cried with a loud voice in the Jewish [language] to the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to frighten them and to trouble them; that they might take the city.
\[19]And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of man's hand.
\[20]And because of this, king Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz prayed and cried to heaven.
\[21]And Jehovah sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the princes and the captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. And he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels made him fall there with the sword.
\[22]And Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all, and protected them on every side.
\[23]And many brought gifts unto Jehovah to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; and he was thenceforth magnified in the sight of all the nations.
\[24]In those days Hezekiah was sick unto death, and he prayed to Jehovah; and he spoke to him and gave him a sign.
\[25]But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit [done] to him, for his heart was lifted up; and there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
\[26]And Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Jehovah came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
\[27]And Hezekiah had very much riches and honour; and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant vessels;
\[28]storehouses also for the increase of corn and new wine and oil, and stalls for all manner of beasts, and [he procured] flocks for the stalls.
\[29]And he provided for himself cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God gave him very much substance.
\[30]And he, Hezekiah, stopped the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
\[31]However in [the matter of] the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all [that was] in his heart.
\[32]And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\[33]And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the highest place of the sepulchres of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

anasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
\[2]And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, like the abominations of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed from before the children of Israel.
\[3]And he built again the high places that Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars to the Baals, and made Asherahs, and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them.
\[4]And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, of which Jehovah had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.
\[5]And he built altars to all the host of heaven in both courts of the house of Jehovah.
\[6]He also caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he used magic and divination and sorcery, and appointed necromancers and soothsayers: he wrought evil beyond measure in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
\[7]And he set the graven image of the idol that he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever;
\[8]neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land that I have appointed to your fathers; if they will only take heed to do all that I commanded them through Moses, according to all the law and the statutes and the ordinances.
\[9]And Manasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray, to do more evil than the nations that Jehovah had destroyed from before the children of Israel.
\[10]And Jehovah spoke to Manasseh and to his people; but they did not hearken.
\[11]And Jehovah brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh with fetters, and bound him with chains of brass, and carried him to Babylon.
\[12]And when he was in affliction, he besought Jehovah his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,
\[13]and prayed to him. And he was intreated of him and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah, he was God.
\[14]And after this he built the outer wall of the city of David, on the west, toward Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance of the fish-gate, and carried it round Ophel, and raised it up a very great height; and he put captains of war in all the fortified cities of Judah.
\[15]And he removed the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built on the mount of the house of Jehovah and in Jerusalem, and cast [them] out of the city.
\[16]And he reinstated the altar of Jehovah, and sacrificed on it peace-offerings and thank-offerings, and commanded Judah to serve Jehovah the God of Israel.
\[17]Nevertheless, the people sacrificed still on the high places, although to Jehovah their God only.
\[18]And the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, behold, they [are written] in the acts of the kings of Israel.
\[19]And his prayer, and [how God] was intreated of him, and all his sin and his unfaithfulness, and the places in which he built high places, and set up Asherahs and graven images, before he was humbled, behold, they are written among the words of Hozai.
\[20]And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house; and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
\[21]Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
\[22]And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, as Manasseh his father had done; and Amon sacrificed to all the graven images that Manasseh his father had made, and served them.
\[23]And he did not humble himself before Jehovah, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; for he, Amon, multiplied trespass.
\[24]And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.
\[25]But the people of the land smote all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.

osiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
\[2]And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand nor to the left.
\[3]And in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherahs, and the graven images, and the molten images.
\[4]And they broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence; and the sun-pillars that were on high above them he cut down; and the Asherahs and the graven images and the molten images he broke in pieces, and made dust [of them] and strewed it upon the graves of those that had sacrificed to them;
\[5]and he burned the bones of the priests upon their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.
\[6]And [so did he] in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even to Naphtali, in their ruins round about;
\[7]and he broke down the altars, and beat the Asherahs and the graven images into powder, and cut down all the sun-pillars throughout the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.
\[8]And in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the chronicler, to repair the house of Jehovah his God.
\[9]And they came to Hilkijah the high priest, and they delivered [to them] the money that had been brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[10]And they gave [it] into the hand of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and they gave it to the workmen who wrought in the house of Jehovah to reinstate and repair the house:
\[11]they gave [it] to the carpenters and the builders, to buy hewn stone, and timber for the joists, and to floor the houses that the kings of Judah had destroyed.
\[12]And the men did the work faithfully. And over them were appointed Jahath and Obadiah, Levites, of the children of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the children of the Kohathites, for the oversight; and all these Levites were skilled in instruments of music.
\[13]They were also over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that worked in any manner of service. And of the Levites were the scribes, and officers, and doorkeepers.
\[14]And when they brought out the money that had been brought into the house of Jehovah, Hilkijah the priest found the book of the law of Jehovah by Moses.
\[15]Then Hilkijah spoke and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkijah gave the book to Shaphan.
\[16]And Shaphan carried the book to the king. And moreover he brought the king word again saying, All that was committed to the hand of thy servants, they do;
\[17]and they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Jehovah, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.
\[18]And Shaphan the scribe informed the king saying, Hilkijah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read out of it before the king.
\[19]And it came to pass when the king heard the words of the law, that he rent his garments.
\[20]And the king commanded Hilkijah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,
\[21]Go, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book which is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah, to do according to all that is written in this book.
\[22]And Hilkijah and they that the king [had appointed] went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokehath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe: now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter [of the town]; and they spoke with her to that effect.
\[23]And she said to them, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: Tell the man that sent you to me,
\[24]Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.
\[25]Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my fury shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.
\[26]But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him: Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel touching the words which thou hast heard:
\[27]Because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy garments and weep before me, I also have heard [thee], saith Jehovah.
\[28]Behold, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof. And they brought the king word again.
\[29]And the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.
\[30]And the king went up into the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests and the Levites, and all the people, great and small; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which had been found in the house of Jehovah.
\[31]And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that are written in this book.
\[32]And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand [to it]. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
\[33]And Josiah removed all the abominations out of all the countries that belonged to the children of Israel, and made to serve all that were found in Israel,—to serve Jehovah their God: all his days they did not depart from following Jehovah, the God of their fathers.

nd Josiah held a passover to Jehovah in Jerusalem; and they slaughtered the passover on the fourteenth of the first month.
\[2]And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of Jehovah.
\[3]And he said to the Levites, that taught all Israel, [and] who were holy to Jehovah, Put the holy ark in the house that Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built; ye have not to carry it upon your shoulders. Serve now Jehovah your God, and his people Israel;
\[4]and prepare yourselves by your fathers' houses, in your divisions, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son;
\[5]and stand in the sanctuary for the classes of the fathers' houses, for your brethren, the children of the people, and [according] to the divisions of the fathers' houses of the Levites;
\[6]and slaughter the passover, and hallow yourselves, and prepare it for your brethren, that they may do according to the word of Jehovah through Moses.
\[7]And Josiah gave for the children of the people a heave-offering of the flocks, lambs and goats, all for the passover-offerings, for all that were present—to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance.
\[8]And his princes gave a voluntary heave-offering for the people, for the priests, and for the Levites: Hilkijah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand six hundred [small cattle] and three hundred oxen;
\[9]and Conaniah, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave as heave-offering to the Levites for the passover-offerings five thousand [small cattle] and five hundred oxen.
\[10]And the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the king's commandment.
\[11]And they slaughtered the passover, and the priests sprinkled [the blood] from their hand, and the Levites flayed them.
\[12]And they set apart the burnt-offerings to give them to the classes of the fathers' houses of the children of the people, to present them to Jehovah, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so [did they] with the oxen.
\[13]And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance; and the consecrated things they boiled in pots and in cauldrons and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the children of the people.
\[14]And afterwards they made ready for themselves and for the priests; because the priests, the sons of Aaron, [were engaged] in offering up the burnt-offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.
\[15]And the singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the doorkeepers were at every gate; they had not to depart from their service, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
\[16]And all the service of Jehovah was prepared the same day, to hold the passover, and to offer burnt-offerings on the altar of Jehovah according to the commandment of king Josiah.
\[17]And the children of Israel that were present held the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
\[18]And there was no passover like to that holden in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel hold such a passover as Josiah held, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[19]In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover holden.
\[20]After all this, when Josiah had arranged the house, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Karkemish at the Euphrates; and Josiah went out against him.
\[21]And he sent messengers to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house with which I have war; and God has told me to make haste: keep aloof from God who is with me, that he destroy thee not.
\[22]But Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight against him; and he hearkened not to the words of Necho from the mouth of God; and he came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
\[23]And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away, for I am sore wounded.
\[24]And his servants took him out from the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
\[25]And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah; and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day; and they made them an ordinance for Israel. And behold, they are written in the lamentations.
\[26]And the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of Jehovah,

\[3]And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and imposed a fine upon the land of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
\[4]And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
\[5]Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and he did evil in the sight of Jehovah his God.
\[6]Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him with chains of brass to carry him to Babylon.
\[7]And Nebuchadnezzar carried [part] of the vessels of the house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
\[8]And the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
\[9]Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem; and he did evil in the sight of Jehovah.
\[10]And at the turn of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent and had him brought to Babylon, with the precious vessels of the house of Jehovah; and he made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.
\[11]Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
\[12]And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah his God; he humbled not himself before the prophet Jeremiah speaking from the mouth of Jehovah.
\[13]And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him take oath by God; and he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from returning to Jehovah the God of Israel.
\[14]All the chiefs of the priests also, and the people, increased their transgressions, according to all the abominations of the nations; and they defiled the house of Jehovah which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.
\[15]And Jehovah the God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending; because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling-place.
\[16]But they mocked at the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the fury of Jehovah rose against his people, and there was no remedy.
\[17]And he brought up [against] them the king of the Chaldees, and slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and spared not young man nor maiden, old man nor him of hoary head: he gave [them] all into his hand.
\[18]And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king and of his princes, he brought all to Babylon.
\[19]And they burned the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burned all the palaces thereof with fire, and all the precious vessels thereof were given up to destruction.
\[20]And them that had escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon; and they became servants to him and his sons, until the reign of the kingdom of Persia;
\[21]to fulfil the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths. All the days of its desolation it kept sabbath, to fulfil seventy years.
\[22]And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he made a proclamation throughout his kingdom, and also in writing, saying,
\[23]Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth has Jehovah the God of the heavens given to me, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whosoever there is among you of all his people, Jehovah his God be with him, and let him go up.

\[4]And whosoever remains in any place where he sojourns, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the voluntary offering for the house of God which is at Jerusalem.
\[5]And the chief fathers of Judah and Benjamin rose up, and the priests, and the Levites, even all those whose spirit God had stirred, to go up to build the house of Jehovah which is at Jerusalem.
\[6]And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with articles of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.
\[7]And king Cyrus brought forth the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem and had put in the house of his god.
\[8]And Cyrus king of Persia brought them forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.
\[9]And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine-and-twenty knives,
\[10]thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second [sort] four hundred and ten, [and] other vessels a thousand.
\[11]All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand four hundred. The whole did Sheshbazzar bring up, when they of the captivity were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem.

\[2]Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer up burnt-offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.
\[3]And they set the altar on its base; for fear was upon them because of the people of the countries; and they offered up burnt-offerings on it to Jehovah, the morning and evening burnt-offerings.
\[4]And they held the feast of tabernacles as it is written, and [offered] daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;
\[5]and afterwards the continual burnt-offering, and those of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of Jehovah that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a voluntary offering to Jehovah.
\[6]From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer up burnt-offerings to Jehovah. But the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was not [yet] laid.
\[7]And they gave money to the masons and to the carpenters; and meat and drink and oil to the Zidonians and to the Tyrians, to bring cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
\[8]And in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and they appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to superintend the work of the house of Jehovah.
\[9]And Jeshua stood up, his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, as one [man], to superintend the workmen in the house of God; [also] the sons of Henadad, their sons and their brethren, the Levites.
\[10]And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, they set the priests in their apparel, with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise Jehovah according to the directions of David king of Israel.
\[11]And they sang alternately together in praising and giving thanks to Jehovah: For he is good, for his loving-kindness [endureth] for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout to the praise of Jehovah, because the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid.
\[12]But many of the priests and Levites and chief fathers, the ancient men that had seen the first house, wept with a loud voice, [when] the foundation of this house was laid in their sight; and many shouted aloud for joy.

nd the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building the temple to Jehovah the God of Israel;
\[2]and they came to Zerubbabel and to the chief fathers, and said to them, We would build with you; for we seek your God, as ye; and we have sacrificed to him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up hither.
\[3]But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the chief fathers of Israel said to them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God, but we alone will build to Jehovah the God of Israel, as king Cyrus, the king of Persia, has commanded us.
\[4]And the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building;
\[5]and they hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
\[6]And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
\[7]And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in Aramaic, and interpreted in Aramaic.

\[10]and the rest of the peoples whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over and settled in the cities of Samaria, and the rest [of the country] on this side the river, and so forth.
\[11]This is the copy of the letter that they sent to him: To Artaxerxes the king: Thy servants the men on this side the river, and so forth.
\[12]Be it known to the king that the Jews who came up from thee unto us have come to Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and they complete the walls and join up the foundations.
\[13]Be it known therefore unto the king, that, if this city be built and the walls be completed, they will not pay tribute, tax, and toll, and in the end it will bring damage to the kings.
\[14]Now, since we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not right for us to see the king's injury, therefore have we sent and informed the king;
\[15]that search may be made in the book of the annals of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the annals and know that this city is a rebellious city, which has done damage to kings and provinces, and that they have raised sedition within the same of old time, for which cause this city was destroyed.
\[16]We inform the king that if this city be built and its walls be completed, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.
\[17]The king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and the other places beyond the river: Peace, and so forth.
\[18]The letter that ye sent to us has been read before me distinctly.
\[19]And I gave orders, and search has been made, and it has been found that this city of old time has made insurrection against the kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been raised therein.
\[20]And there have been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all beyond the river; and tribute, tax, and toll were paid to them.
\[21]Now give order to make these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until the order shall be given from me;
\[22]and take heed that ye fail not to do this: why should harm grow to the damage of the kings?
\[23]As soon as the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them cease by force and power.

\[10]We asked their names also, to inform thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.
\[11]And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of the heavens and the earth, and build the house that was built these many years ago; and a great king of Israel built and completed it.
\[12]But after that our fathers had provoked the God of the heavens to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, and he destroyed this house, and carried the people away unto Babylon.
\[13]But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, king Cyrus gave orders to build this house of God.
\[14]And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was at Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon, those did king Cyrus take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one Sheshbazzar by name, whom he had appointed governor.
\[15]And he said to him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is at Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place.
\[16]Then came the same Sheshbazzar, [and] laid the foundation of the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and since that time even until now has it been in building, and it is not completed.
\[17]And now, if it seem good to the king, let search be made in the king's treasure-house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that orders were given by king Cyrus to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.

\[2]And there was found at Achmetha in the fortress that is in the province of Media a roll, and therein was a record thus written:
\[3]In the first year of king Cyrus, king Cyrus made a decree [concerning] the house of God at Jerusalem: Let the house be built for a place where they offer sacrifices, and let its foundations be solidly laid; its height sixty cubits, its breadth sixty cubits,
\[4][with] three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber; and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:
\[5]and also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that is at Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and brought again to the temple that is at Jerusalem, in their place; and thou shalt put [them] in the house of God.
\[6]Therefore Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:
\[7]let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place.
\[8]Moreover, I give orders what ye shall do to these elders of the Jews, for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, of the tribute beyond the river, expenses be diligently given to these men, that they be not hindered.
\[9]And that which they have need of, both young bullocks and rams and lambs, for the burnt-offerings to the God of the heavens, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests that are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail;
\[10]that they may present sweet odours to the God of the heavens, and pray for the life of the king and of his sons.
\[11]Also I have given order that whosoever shall alter this rescript, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon, and let his house be made a dunghill for this.
\[12]And the God that has caused his name to dwell there overthrow every king and people that shall put forth their hand to alter [or] to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have given [this] order; let it be done diligently.
\[13]Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai, and their companions, because of that which king Darius had sent, did so diligently.
\[14]And the elders of the Jews built; and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built and completed [it] according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
\[15]And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of king Darius.
\[16]And the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy;
\[17]and they presented at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
\[18]And they set the priests in their classes, and the Levites in their divisions, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem: as it is written in the book of Moses.
\[19]And the children of the captivity held the passover upon the fourteenth of the first month.
\[20]For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves as one [man]: they were all pure; and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
\[21]And the children of Israel that were come back out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Jehovah the God of Israel, did eat;
\[22]and they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy; for Jehovah had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.

\[16]and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, besides the voluntary offering of the people, and of the priests, who offer willingly for the house of their God which is at Jerusalem.

\[18]And whatever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do according to the will of your God.
\[19]And the vessels that have been given thee for the service of the house of thy God, deliver before the God of Jerusalem.
\[20]And whatever more shall be needful for the house of thy God which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house.
\[21]And I, I Artaxerxes the king, do give orders to all the treasurers that are beyond the river, that whatever Ezra the priest and scribe of the law of the God of the heavens shall require of you, it be done diligently,
\[22]unto a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing [how much].
\[23]Whatever is commanded by the God of the heavens, let it be carefully done for the house of the God of the heavens; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
\[24]Also we inform you, as regards all the priests and Levites, singers, doorkeepers, Nethinim, and ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, tax, and toll upon them.
\[25]And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, which is in thy hand, set magistrates and judges who may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye him that knows [them] not.
\[26]And whosoever will not do the law of thy God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed diligently upon him, whether unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
\[27]Blessed be Jehovah the God of our fathers, who has put [such a thing] as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of Jehovah which is at Jerusalem;
\[28]and has extended mercy to me before the king and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened, as the hand of Jehovah my God was upon me; and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.

\[4]Of the children of Pahath-Moab, Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males.
\[5]Of the children of Shechaniah, the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males.
\[6]And of the children of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males.
\[7]And of the children of Elam, Isaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males.
\[8]And of the children of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him eighty males.
\[9]Of the children of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males.
\[10]And of the children of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah, and with him a hundred and sixty males.
\[11]And of the children of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight males.
\[12]And of the children of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him a hundred and ten males.
\[13]And of the children of Adonikam, the last ones, whose names are these: Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them sixty males.
\[14]And of the children of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.
\[15]And I gathered them together at the river that runs to Ahava; and there we encamped three days; and I surveyed the people and the priests, and found none of the sons of Levi there.
\[16]And I sent for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men, and for Joiarib and for Elnathan, men of understanding.
\[17]And I gave them a commission to Iddo the chief, at the place Casiphia, and I put words in their mouths to say to Iddo [and] his brethren the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.
\[18]And by the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, namely, Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;
\[19]and Hashabiah, and with him Isaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;
\[20]and of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were expressed by name.
\[21]And I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
\[22]For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way; for we had spoken to the king saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his anger is against all them that forsake him.
\[23]And we fasted, and besought our God for this; and he was entreated of us.
\[24]And I separated twelve of the chiefs of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
\[25]and I weighed to them the silver and the gold and the vessels, the heave-offering for the house of our God, which the king and his counsellors and his princes, and all Israel present, had offered.
\[26]And I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver; and silver vessels a hundred talents, [and] of gold a hundred talents;
\[27]and twenty basons of gold, of a thousand darics; and two vessels of shining copper, precious as gold.
\[28]And I said to them, Ye are holy unto Jehovah; the vessels also are holy; and the silver and the gold is a voluntary offering to Jehovah the God of your fathers.
\[29]Watch and keep [them] until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the chiefs of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.
\[30]And the priests and the Levites received by weight the silver and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.
\[31]And we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth of the first month, to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.
\[32]And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
\[33]And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Urijah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them were Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites:
\[34]the whole by number and by weight; and all the weight was written down at that time.
\[35]The children of those that had been carried away, who had come out of the captivity, presented burnt-offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.
\[36]And they delivered the king's edicts to the king's satraps, and to the governors on this side the river. And they furthered the people and the house of God.

ow when these things were completed, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, according to their abominations, [even] of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites;
\[2]for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, and have mingled the holy seed with the peoples of the lands; and the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this unfaithfulness.
\[3]And when I heard this thing, I rent my mantle and my garment, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down overwhelmed.
\[4]Then were assembled to me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the unfaithfulness of those that had been carried away; and I sat overwhelmed until the evening oblation.
\[5]And at the evening oblation I arose up from my humiliation; and with my mantle and my garment rent, I fell on my knees, and spread out my hands to Jehovah my God,
\[6]and said: O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God; for our iniquities are increased over [our] head, and our trespass is grown up to the heavens.
\[7]Since the days of our fathers, we have been in great trespass to this day; and for our iniquities we, our kings, our priests, have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, and to captivity, and to spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.
\[8]And now for a little space there hath been favour from Jehovah our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
\[9]For we are bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us before the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God and to repair the ruins thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
\[10]And now, what shall we say, our God, after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,
\[11]which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess [it], is an unclean land through the filthiness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations with which they have filled it from one end to another through their uncleanness.
\[12]Now therefore give not your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity for ever; that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.
\[13]And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities [deserve], and hast given us such deliverance as this,
\[14]should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples of these abominations? wouldest thou not be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor any to escape?
\[15]Jehovah, God of Israel, thou art righteous; for we are a remnant that is escaped, as [it is] this day. Behold, we are before thee in our trespasses; for there is no standing before thee because of this.

nd while Ezra prayed, and made confession, weeping and falling down before the house of God, there were gathered to him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children; for the people wept very much.
\[2]And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have acted unfaithfully toward our God, and have taken foreign wives of the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.
\[3]And now let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of [my] lord, and of those that tremble at the commandments of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
\[4]Arise, for this matter is incumbent on thee, and we will be with thee: be of good courage, and do [it].
\[5]Then Ezra arose, and made the chiefs of the priests, of the Levites, and of all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. And they swore.
\[6]And Ezra arose from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib; and when he came thither, he ate no bread and drank no water; for he mourned because of the unfaithfulness of them that had been carried away.
\[7]And they made proclamation in Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;
\[8]and that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be confiscated, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.
\[9]Then were all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered together at Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth of the month; and all the people sat in the open space of the house of God, trembling because of the matter, and because of the pouring rain.
\[10]And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, Ye have acted unfaithfully, and have taken foreign wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.
\[11]And now make confession to Jehovah the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure, and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign wives.
\[12]And the whole congregation answered and said with a loud voice, Yes, it is for us to do according to thy words.
\[13]But the people are many, and it is a time of pouring rain, and it is not possible to stand without: neither is this a work for one day or two; for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.
\[14]Let now our princes, while this matter is going on, stand for all the congregation, and let all those that have taken foreign wives in our cities come at the appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce anger of our God be turned from us.
\[15]Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this; and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
\[16]And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest [and] certain of the chief fathers were separated according to their fathers' houses, and all of them [expressed] by name; and they sat down on the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
\[17]And they ended with all the men that had taken foreign wives by the first day of the first month.

he words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the fortress,
\[2]that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and [certain] men of Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
\[3]And they said to me, Those who remain, that are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction and reproach; and the wall of Jerusalem is in ruins, and its gates are burned with fire.
\[4]And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat and wept, and mourned for days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of the heavens,
\[5]and said, I beseech thee, Jehovah, God of the heavens, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and keep his commandments.
\[6]Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, confessing the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.
\[7]We have acted very perversely against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances that thou commandedst thy servant Moses.
\[8]Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the peoples;
\[9]but if ye return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.
\[10]And they are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand.
\[11]O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants who delight to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was the king's cupbearer.

nd it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, [that] wine was before him, and I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now, I had never been sad in his presence.
\[2]And the king said to me, Why is thy face sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sadness of heart. And I was very sore afraid.
\[3]And I said to the king, Let the king live for ever! Why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lies waste, and its gates are consumed with fire?
\[4]And the king said to me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of the heavens.
\[5]And I said to the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.
\[6]And the king said to me—the queen also sitting by him,—For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? And it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
\[7]And I said to the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may set me forward till I come into Judah;
\[8]and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which [appertains] to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
\[9]And I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of a force and horsemen with me.
\[10]And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobijah the servant, the Ammonite, heard [of it], it grieved them exceedingly that there had come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
\[11]And I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
\[12]And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me—but I told no man what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem—and there was no beast with me, except the beast that I rode upon.
\[13]And I went out by night by the valley-gate, even toward the jackal-fountain, and to the dung-gate; and I viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were in ruins, and its gates were consumed with fire.
\[14]And I went on to the fountain-gate, and to the king's pool; and there was no place for the beast under me to pass.
\[15]And I went up in the night through the valley, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the valley-gate and returned.
\[16]And the rulers did not know whither I went or what I did, for I had not as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.
\[17]And I said to them, Ye see the distress that we are in, that Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.
\[18]And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me; as also of the king's words which he had said unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. And they strengthened their hands for the good [work].
\[19]And Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobijah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it; and they mocked us and despised us, and said, What is this thing which ye do? will ye rebel against the king?
\[20]And I answered them, and said to them, The God of the heavens, he will prosper us, and we his servants will arise and build; but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial in Jerusalem.

nd it came to pass that when Sanballat heard that we built the wall, he was angry and very indignant, and mocked the Jews.
\[2]And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? shall they be permitted to go on? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, when they are burned?
\[3]And Tobijah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox went up, it would break down their stone wall.—
\[4]Hear, our God, for we are despised, and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in a land of captivity!
\[5]And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee; for they have provoked the builders.
\[6]But we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to the half thereof; for the people had a mind to work.
\[7]And it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobijah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being repaired, that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,
\[8]and conspired all of them together to come to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.
\[9]Then we prayed to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.
\[10]And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens faileth, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build at the wall.
\[11]And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them and kill them, and put an end to the work.
\[12]And it came to pass that when the Jews that dwelt by them came and told us so ten times, from all the places whence they returned to us,
\[13]I set in the lower places behind the wall in exposed places, I even set the people, according to their families, with their swords, their spears and their bows.
\[14]And I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not afraid of them: remember the Lord who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your houses.
\[15]And it came to pass that when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had defeated their counsel, we returned all of us to the wall, every one to his work.
\[16]And from that time forth the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held the spears, and the shields, and the bows, and the corslets; and the captains were behind all the house of Judah.
\[17]They that built on the wall, and they that bore burdens, with those that loaded, wrought in the work with one hand, and with the other they held a weapon.
\[18]And the builders had every one his sword girded by his side, and built. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.
\[19]And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and extended, and we are scattered upon the wall, one far from another:
\[20]in what place ye hear the sound of the trumpet, thither shall ye assemble to us; our God will fight for us.
\[21]And we laboured in the work; and half of them held the spears from the rising of the dawn till the stars appeared.
\[22]Likewise at the same time I said to the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and [be for] labour in the day.
\[23]And neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our garments: every one had his weapon on his right side.

nd there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.
\[2]And there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many, and we must procure corn that we may eat and live.
\[3]And there were that said, We have had to pledge our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses, that we might procure corn in the dearth.
\[4]And there were that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute upon our fields and vineyards;
\[5]yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and behold, we must bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage [already]; neither is it in the power of our hand [to redeem them], for other men have our fields and our vineyards.
\[6]And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
\[7]And I consulted with myself; and I remonstrated with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother! And I set a great assembly against them.
\[8]And I said to them, We, according to our ability, have redeemed our brethren the Jews, who were sold to the nations; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? And they were silent and found no answer.
\[9]And I said, The thing that ye do is not good. Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, so as not to be the reproach of the nations our enemies?
\[10]I also, my brethren and my servants, we might exact usury of them, money and corn. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.
\[11]Restore, I pray you, to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive-gardens, and their houses, also the hundredth [part] of the money, and of the corn, the wine and the oil, that ye have exacted of them.
\[12]And they said, We will restore [them], and will require nothing of them; so will we do, as thou hast said. And I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.
\[13]Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house and from his earnings, that performeth not this promise: even thus be he shaken out and emptied! And all the congregation said, Amen! And they praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise.
\[14]Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.
\[15]But the former governors that were before me had been chargeable to the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver: even their servants bore rule over the people. But I did not so, because of the fear of God.
\[16]Yea, also I applied myself to this work of the wall, and we bought no fields; and all my servants were gathered thither for the work.
\[17]And there were at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews and the rulers, besides those that came to us from among the nations that were about us.
\[18]And that which was prepared daily was one ox [and] six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days all sorts of wine in abundance. Yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor; for the service was heavy upon this people.
\[19]Remember for me, my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.

nd it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobijah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it (though at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),
\[2]that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
\[3]And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down. Why should the work cease, whilst I leave it and come down to you?
\[4]And they sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them in the same manner.
\[5]Then sent Sanballat his servant to me in this manner the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand,
\[6]in which was written: It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says [it, that] thou and the Jews think to rebel, for which cause thou buildest the wall, and according to these words thou wilt become their king.
\[7]And thou hast also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning thee at Jerusalem saying, There is a king in Judah! And now it will be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.
\[8]And I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.
\[9]For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be slackened from the work, that it be not carried out.—Now therefore strengthen my hands!
\[10]And I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabeel, who had shut himself up. And he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they are coming to kill thee; even in the night are they coming to kill thee.
\[11]And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, could go into the temple, and live? I will not go in.
\[12]And I perceived, and behold, God had not sent him; for he pronounced this prophecy against me; and Tobijah and Sanballat had hired him.
\[13]Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have wherewith to spread an evil report, that they might reproach me.
\[14]My God, remember Tobijah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets who would have put me in fear.
\[15]So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.
\[16]And it came to pass that when all our enemies heard [of it], all the nations that were about us were afraid and were much cast down in their own eyes, and they perceived that this work was wrought by our God.
\[17]Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobijah, and those of Tobijah came to them.
\[18]For there were many in Judah sworn to him; for he was a son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
\[19]Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. [And] Tobijah sent letters to put me in fear.

nd it came to pass when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, that the doorkeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed.
\[2]And I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the citadel, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man and feared God above many.
\[3]And I said to them that the gates of Jerusalem should not be opened until the sun was hot, and that they should shut the doors and bar them while they stood by; and that there should be appointed watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one over against his house.
\[4]Now the city was large and great; but the people in it were few, and no houses were built.

ll the people gathered together as one man to the open place that was before the water-gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded Israel.
\[2]And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation, both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month.
\[3]And he read in it before the open place that was before the water-gate from the morning until midday, in presence of the men and the women, and those that could understand. And the ears of all the people were [attentive] to the book of the law.
\[4]And Ezra the scribe stood upon a high stage of wood, which they had made for the purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkijah, and Maaseiah on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddana, Zechariah, Meshullam.
\[5]And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up.
\[6]And Ezra blessed Jehovah, the great God; and all the people answered, Amen, Amen! with lifting up of their hands; and they bowed their heads, and worshipped Jehovah with their faces to the ground.
\[7]And Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law; and the people [stood] in their place.
\[8]And they read in the law of God distinctly out of the book, and gave the sense, and caused [them] to understand the reading.
\[9]And Nehemiah, that is, the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that explained to the people, said to all the people, This day is holy to Jehovah your God: mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law.
\[10]And he said to them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them for whom nothing is prepared; for the day is holy to our Lord; and be not grieved, for the joy of Jehovah is your strength.
\[11]And the Levites quieted all the people, saying, Be still! for the day is holy; neither be grieved.
\[12]And all the people went their way, to eat and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great rejoicing. For they had understood the words that were declared to them.
\[13]And on the second day were gathered together the chief fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, even to gain wisdom as to the words of the law.
\[14]And they found written in the law which Jehovah had commanded through Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month,
\[15]and that they should publish and proclaim through all their cities, and at Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, and fetch olive-branches, and wild olive-branches, and myrtle-branches, and palm-branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.
\[16]And the people went forth and brought [them], and made themselves booths, everyone upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the open space of the water-gate, and in the open space of the gate of Ephraim.
\[17]And all the congregation of them that had come back from the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths. For since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun until that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.
\[18]Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they observed the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance.

nd on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.
\[2]And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
\[3]And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of Jehovah their God a fourth part of the day; and a fourth part they confessed, and worshipped Jehovah their God.
\[4]Then stood up upon the platform of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, Chenani, and cried with a loud voice to Jehovah their God.
\[5]And the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, Pethahiah, said, Stand up, bless Jehovah your God from eternity to eternity. And let [men] bless the name of thy glory, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
\[6]Thou art the Same, thou alone, Jehovah, who hast made the heaven of heavens, and all their host, the earth and all that is therein, the seas and all that is therein. And thou quickenest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.
\[7]Thou art the Same, Jehovah Elohim, who didst choose Abram and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham;
\[8]and foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest the covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites,—to give it to his seed; and thou hast performed thy words, for thou art righteous.
\[9]And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea;
\[10]and didst shew signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants, and upon all the people of his land; for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them, and thou didst make thee a name, as it is this day.
\[11]And thou didst divide the sea before them, and they went through the midst of the sea on dry [ground]; and their pursuers thou threwest into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters.
\[12]And thou leddest them in the day by a pillar of cloud, and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.
\[13]And thou camest down on mount Sinai, and didst speak with them from the heavens, and gavest them right judgments and true laws, good statutes and commandments.
\[14]And thou madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and prescribedst for them commandments and statutes and a law, through Moses thy servant.
\[15]And thou gavest them bread from the heavens for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and didst say to them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.
\[16]But they, our fathers, dealt proudly, and hardened their neck, and hearkened not to thy commandments,
\[17]and refused to obey, neither were they mindful of thy wonders which thou hadst done among them; but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion made a captain to return to their bondage. But thou art a +God ready to forgive, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and of great loving-kindness, and thou forsookest them not.
\[18]Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy god that brought thee up out of Egypt! and they had wrought great provocation,
\[19]yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness. The pillar of the cloud departed not from over them by day, to lead them on the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.
\[20]Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.
\[21]Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing; their clothes grew not old, and their feet swelled not.
\[22]And thou gavest them kingdoms and peoples, and didst divide them by countries; and they possessed the land of Sihon, as well the land of the king of Heshbon, as the land of Og king of Bashan.
\[23]And their children thou didst multiply as the stars of heaven, and thou broughtest them into the land concerning which thou didst say to their fathers that they should go in to possess it.
\[24]And the children went in and possessed the land; and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, both their kings and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
\[25]And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, wells digged, vineyards and olive-gardens, and fruit trees in abundance. And they did eat and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.
\[26]But they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets who testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.
\[27]And thou gavest them into the hand of their oppressors, and they oppressed them; and in the time of their distress, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from the heavens, and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their oppressors.
\[28]But when they had rest, they did evil again before thee; and thou didst leave them in the hand of their enemies, and they had dominion over them; and again they cried unto thee, and thou heardest [them] from the heavens, and many times didst thou deliver them, according to thy mercies.
\[29]And thou testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law; but they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thine ordinances (which if a man do, he shall live in them); and they withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
\[30]And many years didst thou forbear with them, and testifiedst against them by thy Spirit through thy prophets; but they would not give ear: and thou gavest them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
\[31]Nevertheless for thy manifold mercies' sake, thou didst not make a full end of them nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.
\[32]And now, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and loving-kindness, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the days of the kings of Assyria unto this day.
\[33]But thou art just in all that is come upon us; for thou hast acted according to truth, and we have done wickedly.
\[34]And our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers, have not performed thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.
\[35]And they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land that thou didst set before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.
\[36]Behold, we are servants this day, and the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are bondmen in it.
\[37]And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: and they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure; and we are in great distress.
\[38]And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, [and] our priests are at the sealing.

\[10]And Jeshua begot Joiakim, and Joiakim begot Eliashib, and Eliashib begot Joiada,
\[11]and Joiada begot Jonathan, and Jonathan begot Jaddua.

\[23]The children of Levi, the chief fathers, were recorded in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
\[24]And the chief Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise [and] to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward.
\[25]Mattaniah and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were doorkeepers keeping the ward at the storehouses of the gates.
\[26]These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.
\[27]And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to hold the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, [with] cymbals, lutes and harps.
\[28]And the children of the singers were assembled, both from the plain [of Jordan] round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites,
\[29]also from Beth-Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had built themselves hamlets round about Jerusalem.
\[30]And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates and the wall.
\[31]And I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great choirs and processions, on the right hand upon the wall towards the dung-gate.
\[32]And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
\[33]and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
\[34]Judah and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
\[35]and [certain] of the priests' sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;
\[36]and his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azareel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe before them.
\[37]And at the fountain-gate, and over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water-gate eastward.
\[38]And the second choir went in the opposite direction upon the wall, and I after them, and the half of the people, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even to the broad wall;
\[39]and from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the gate of the old [wall], and above the fish-gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even to the sheep-gate; and they stood still in the prison-gate.
\[40]And both choirs stood in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me;
\[41]and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah, with trumpets;
\[42]and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud; and Jizrahiah was their overseer.
\[43]And that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and also the women and the children rejoiced. And the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
\[44]And at that time men were appointed over the chambers of the treasures for the heave-offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, out of the fields of the cities, the portions assigned by the law for the priests and the Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests, and over the Levites that waited.
\[45]And, with the singers and the doorkeepers, they kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David [and] of Solomon his son.
\[46]For of old, in the days of David and Asaph, there were the chiefs of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgivings to God.
\[47]And all Israel, in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the doorkeepers, every day what was needed, and they consecrated things for the Levites; and the Levites consecrated for the children of Aaron.

n that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and there was found written in it that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;
\[2]because they had not met the children of Israel with bread and with water, and had hired Balaam against them, to curse them; but our God turned the curse into blessing.
\[3]And it came to pass, when they heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
\[4]And before this, Eliashib the priest, who had the oversight of the chambers of the house of our God, a kinsman of Tobijah,
\[5]had prepared for him a great chamber, where formerly they laid the oblations, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine and the oil, which was commanded for the Levites and the singers and the doorkeepers, and the heave-offerings of the priests.
\[6]And during all that [time] I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two-and-thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I came to the king; and after some time I obtained leave of the king.
\[7]And I came to Jerusalem, and observed the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobijah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
\[8]And it grieved me much, and I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobijah out of the chamber.
\[9]And I commanded, and they purified the chambers; and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, the oblation and the frankincense.
\[10]And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given, and that the Levites and the singers that did the work had fled every one to his field.
\[11]Then I contended with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together and set them in their place.
\[12]And all Judah brought the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil into the storehouses.
\[13]And I made storekeepers over the storehouses: Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and subordinate to them, Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were esteemed faithful, and their office was to distribute to their brethren.
\[14]Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds which I have done for the house of my God, and for the charges thereof!
\[15]In those days I saw in Judah some treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading them on asses; as also wine, grapes and figs, and all manner of burdens; and they brought them into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I protested in the day on which they sold the victuals.
\[16]Men of Tyre also dwelt therein, who brought fish and all manner of ware, and sold it on the sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
\[17]And I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this which ye do, profaning the sabbath day?
\[18]Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us and upon this city? And ye will bring more wrath against Israel by profaning the sabbath.
\[19]And it came to pass, that when it began to be dark in the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut; and I commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath. And I set [some] of my servants at the gates, so that no burden should be brought in on the sabbath day.
\[20]And the dealers and sellers of all kind of ware passed the night without Jerusalem once or twice.
\[21]And I testified against them, and said to them, Why do ye pass the night before the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth they came not on the sabbath.
\[22]And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to hallow the sabbath day. Remember this also for me, my God, and spare me according to thy great loving-kindness!
\[23]In those days also I saw Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab.
\[24]And their children spoke half in the language of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.
\[25]And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them and plucked off their hair, and adjured them by God [saying], Ye shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.
\[26]Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among the many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel; but even him did foreign wives cause to sin.
\[27]And should we hearken to you to do all this great evil, to act unfaithfully to our God by marrying foreign wives?
\[28]And [one] of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; and I chased him from me.
\[29]Remember them, my God, for they are polluters of the priesthood, and of the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites!
\[30]And I purified them from all foreigners, and appointed the charges of the priests and the Levites, every one in his service;
\[31]and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good!

nd it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (that is, the Ahasuerus that reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces),
\[2]in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the fortress,
\[3]in the third year of his reign, he made a feast to all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and the princes of the provinces being before him;
\[4]when he shewed the glorious wealth of his kingdom and the splendid magnificence of his grandeur many days, a hundred and eighty days.
\[5]And when these days were expired, the king made a feast to all the people that were present in Shushan the fortress, both to great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace.
\[6]White, green, and blue [hangings] were fastened with cords of byssus and purple to silver rings and pillars of white marble; couches of gold and silver [lay] upon a pavement of red and white marble, and alabaster, and black marble.
\[7]And they gave drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance, according to the king's bounty.
\[8]And the drinking was, according to commandment, without constraint; for so the king had appointed to all the magnates of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.
\[9]Also the queen Vashti made a feast for the women of the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
\[10]On the seventh day, when the king's heart was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of king Ahasuerus,
\[11]to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown to shew the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was of beautiful countenance.
\[12]But the queen Vashti refused to come at the word of the king which was [sent] by the chamberlains; and the king was very wroth, and his fury burned in him.
\[13]And the king said to the wise men who knew the times (for so was the king's business [conducted] before all that knew law and judgment;
\[14]and the next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, [and] Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and who sat first in the kingdom),
\[15]What shall be done to the queen Vashti according to law, because she has not performed the word of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
\[16]Then said Memucan before the king and the princes, The queen Vashti has not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
\[17]For the act of the queen will come abroad to all women, so as to render their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when they shall say, The king Ahasuerus commanded the queen Vashti to be brought in before him, and she came not!
\[18]And the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's act, will say it this day to all the king's princes, and there will be contempt and anger enough.
\[19]If it please the king, let a royal order go forth from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it may not pass, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another that is better than she;
\[20]and when the king's edict which he shall make shall be heard throughout his realm—for it is great—all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, from the greatest to the least.
\[21]And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan.
\[22]And he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people according to their language, That every man should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the language of his people.

fter these things, when the fury of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
\[2]Then said the king's servants that attended upon him, Let there be maidens, virgins of beautiful countenance, sought for the king;
\[3]and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the young virgins of beautiful countenance to Shushan the fortress, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given.
\[4]And let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
\[5]There was in Shushan the fortress a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjaminite,
\[6]who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
\[7]And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter; for she had neither father nor mother—and the maiden was fair and beautiful—and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.
\[8]And it came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the fortress, unto the custody of Hegai, that Esther also was brought into the king's house, unto the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
\[9]And the maiden pleased him, and obtained favour before him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, and her portions, and the seven maidens selected to be given her, out of the king's house; and he removed her and her maids to the best [place] of the house of the women.
\[10]Esther had not made known her people nor her birth; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known.
\[11]And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.
\[12]And when every maiden's turn came to go in to king Ahasuerus after that she had been treated for twelve months, according to the manner of the women (for so were the days of their purification accomplished—six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with spices, and with things for the purifying of the women,
\[13]and thus came the maiden in unto the king), whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women to the king's house.
\[14]In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, unto the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, keeper of the concubines. She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she were called by name.
\[15]And when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained grace in the sight of all them that saw her.
\[16]So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus, into his royal house, in the tenth month, that is, the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
\[17]And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins, and he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
\[18]And the king made a great feast to all his princes and his servants, Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave presents according to the king's bounty.
\[19]And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai sat in the king's gate.
\[20](Esther, as Mordecai had charged her, had not yet made known her birth nor her people; for Esther did what Mordecai told her, like as when she was brought up with him.)
\[21]In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the threshold, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
\[22]And the thing became known to Mordecai, and he related it to Esther the queen, and Esther told it to the king in Mordecai's name.
\[23]And the matter was investigated and found out; and they were both hanged on a tree. And it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.

fter these things king Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.
\[2]And all the king's servants that were in the king's gate bowed and did Haman reverence, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did [him] reverence.
\[3]Then the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, said to Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?
\[4]And it came to pass as they spoke daily to him, and he hearkened not to them, that they informed Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.
\[5]And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, Haman was full of fury.
\[6]But he scorned to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai; therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus—the people of Mordecai.
\[7]In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman for each day and for each month, to the twelfth [month], that is, the month Adar.
\[8]And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from [those of] every people, and they keep not the king's laws; and it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.
\[9]If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have charge of the affairs, to bring [it] into the king's treasuries.
\[10]And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.
\[11]And the king said to Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as seems good to thee.
\[12]Then were the king's scribes called, in the first month, on the thirteenth day of the [month], and there was written according to all that Haman commanded unto the king's satraps, and to the governors over every province, and to the princes of every people; to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people according to their language: in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.
\[13]And the letters were sent by couriers into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, upon the thirteenth of the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, and [to take] the spoil of them for a prey.
\[14]That the decree might be given in every province, a copy of the writing was published to all peoples, that they should be ready against that day.
\[15]The couriers went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the fortress. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was in consternation.

\[3]And in every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing: many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
\[4]And Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told [it] her; and the queen was exceedingly grieved: and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him; but he received [it] not.
\[5]Then Esther called for Hatach, [one] of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to wait upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.
\[6]And Hatach went forth to Mordecai, unto the public place of the city which was before the king's gate.
\[7]And Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and of the sum of money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
\[8]And he gave him a copy of the writing of the decree that had been given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew [it] to Esther, and to declare [it] to her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him, for her people.
\[9]And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
\[10]And Esther spoke to Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai:
\[11]All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces do know that whoever, whether man or woman, shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is *one* law, to put [him] to death, except [such] to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live; and I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.
\[12]And they told Mordecai Esther's words.
\[13]And Mordecai bade to answer Esther: Imagine not in thy heart that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.
\[14]For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there arise relief and deliverance to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall perish. And who knows whether thou art [not] come to the kingdom for such a time as this?
\[15]And Esther bade to answer Mordecai:
\[16]Go, gather together all the Jews that are found in Shushan, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise, and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish.
\[17]And Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.

\[2]And it was so, when the king saw the queen Esther standing in the court, that she obtained grace in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand; and Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.
\[3]And the king said to her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom.
\[4]And Esther said, If it seem good to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.
\[5]And the king said, Hasten Haman, that it may be done as Esther has said. And the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
\[6]And the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee; and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be done.
\[7]And Esther answered and said, My petition and my request is,
\[8]If I have found grace in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow according to the king's word.
\[9]And Haman went forth that day joyful and glad of heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up nor moved for him, he was full of fury against Mordecai.
\[10]But Haman controlled himself, and came home; and he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.
\[11]And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.
\[12]And Haman said, Yea, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow also I am invited to her with the king.
\[13]Yet all this is of no avail to me so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.
\[14]Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends to him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king that Mordecai may be hanged on it: then go in merrily with the king to the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.

\[2]And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, keepers of the threshold, who had sought to lay hand on king Ahasuerus.
\[3]And the king said, What honour and dignity has been done to Mordecai for this? And the king's servants that attended upon him said, Nothing has been done for him.
\[4]And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman had come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak to the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
\[5]And the king's servants said to him, Behold, Haman is standing in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.
\[6]So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What is to be done with the man whom the king delights to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to me?
\[7]And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delights to honour,
\[8]let the royal apparel be brought with which the king arrays himself, and the horse that the king rides upon, and on the head of which the royal crown is set;
\[9]and let the apparel and horse be delivered into the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, and let them array the man whom the king delights to honour, and cause him to ride on the horse through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honour!
\[10]And the king said to Haman, Make haste, take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do so to Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast said.
\[11]And Haman took the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honour!
\[12]And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house, mourning and having his head covered.
\[13]And Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and to all his friends all that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife to him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but wilt certainly fall before him.

\[2]And the king said again to Esther on the second day, at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee; and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be done.
\[3]And Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found grace in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request;
\[4]for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the adversary could not compensate the king's damage.
\[5]And king Ahasuerus spoke and said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he that has filled his heart to do so?
\[6]And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen.
\[7]And the king in his wrath rose up from the banquet of wine, [and went] into the palace garden; but Haman stayed to make request for his life to Esther the queen, for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.
\[8]And the king returned out of the palace garden into the house of the banquet of wine, and Haman was fallen upon the couch on which Esther was. And the king said, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? The word went forth out of the king's mouth, and they covered Haman's face.
\[9]And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold, also, the gallows fifty cubits high, that Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, stands in the house of Haman. And the king said, Hang him on it!

\[2]And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
\[3]And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device which he had devised against the Jews.
\[4]And the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. And Esther arose and stood before the king,
\[5]and said, If it please the king and if I have found grace before him, and the thing seem right to the king, and I be pleasing in his sight, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews that are in all the king's provinces.
\[6]For how shall I endure to see the evil that shall befall my people? and how shall I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
\[7]And king Ahasuerus said to queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he stretched forth his hand against the Jews.
\[8]Write ye then for the Jews as seems good to you, in the king's name, and seal [it] with the king's ring. For a writing that is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, cannot be reversed.
\[9]Then were the king's scribes called at that time, in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth [day] thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors, and the princes of the provinces which are from India even to Ethiopia, a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people according to their language, and to the Jews according to their writing and according to their language.
\[10]And he wrote in the name of king Ahasuerus, and sealed [it] with the king's ring, and sent letters by couriers on horseback riding on coursers, horses of blood reared in the breeding studs:
\[11][stating] that the king granted the Jews that were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that might assault them, [their] little ones and women, and to [take] the spoil of them for a prey,
\[12]upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, upon the thirteenth of the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.
\[13]That the decree might be given in every province, a copy of the writing was published to all the peoples, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
\[14]The couriers mounted on coursers [and] horses of blood went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the fortress.
\[15]And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a mantle of byssus and purple; and the city of Shushan shouted and was glad.
\[16]The Jews had light, and joy, and gladness, and honour.
\[17]And in every province, and in every city, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them.

\[2]the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout the provinces of king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt. And no man could withstand them; for the fear of them had fallen upon all the peoples.
\[3]And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors and officers of the king, helped the Jews; for the fear of Mordecai had fallen upon them.
\[4]For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went forth throughout the provinces; for the man Mordecai became continually greater.
\[5]And the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and slaughter and destruction, and did what they would to those that hated them.
\[6]And in Shushan the fortress the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.
\[7]And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,
\[8]and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
\[9]and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,
\[10]the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the oppressor of the Jews, they slew; but they laid not their hands on the prey.
\[11]On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the fortress was brought before the king.
\[12]And the king said to Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the fortress, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? And what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee; and what is thy request further? and it shall be done.
\[13]And Esther said, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews that are in Shushan to do to-morrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.
\[14]And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.
\[15]And the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but they laid not their hand on the prey.
\[16]And the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their life, and had rest from their enemies; and they slew of them that hated them seventy-five thousand (but they laid not their hand on the prey),
\[17]on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and joy.
\[18]But the Jews that were at Shushan gathered themselves together on the thirteenth [day] thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and joy.
\[19]Therefore the Jews of the villages that dwell in the country towns make the fourteenth of the month Adar a day of joy and feasting, and a good day, and on which they send portions one to another.
\[20]And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews near and far that were in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus,
\[21]to establish [this] among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,
\[22]as the days on which the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month that was turned to them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.
\[23]And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written to them.
\[24]For Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the oppressor of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them and to destroy them;
\[25]and when [Esther] came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head; and they hanged him and his sons on the gallows.
\[26]Therefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore, according to all the words of this letter, and for what they had seen concerning this matter and what had happened to them,
\[27]the Jews ordained and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves to them, so that it should not fail, that they would observe these two days according to their writing and according to their fixed time, every year;
\[28]and that these days should be remembered and observed throughout every generation, in every family, every province, and every city, and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them cease from among their seed.
\[29]And queen Esther the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.
\[30]And he sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, words of peace and truth,
\[31]to confirm these days of Purim in their fixed times, according as Mordecai the Jew and queen Esther had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, as to the matters of the fastings and their cry.

here was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and this man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and abstained from evil.
\[2]And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
\[3]And his substance was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and very many servants; and this man was greater than all the children of the east.
\[4]And his sons went and made a feast in the house of each one on his day; and they sent and invited their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
\[5]And it was so, when the days of the feasting were gone about, that Job sent and hallowed them; and he rose up early in the morning, and offered up burnt-offerings [according to] the number of them all; for Job said, It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
\[6]And there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah; and Satan came also among them.
\[7]And Jehovah said to Satan, Whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
\[8]And Jehovah said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and abstaineth from evil?
\[9]And Satan answered Jehovah and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
\[10]Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is spread abroad in the land.
\[11]But put forth thy hand now and touch all that he hath, [and see] if he will not curse thee to thy face!
\[12]And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.
\[13]And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn.
\[14]And there came a messenger to Job and said, The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them;
\[15]and [they of] Sheba fell [upon them] and took them, and the servants have they smitten with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.
\[16]While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.
\[17]While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels and took them, and the servants have they smitten with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.
\[18]While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn;
\[19]and behold, there came a great wind from over the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they died; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.
\[20]And Job rose up, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped;
\[21]and he said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah!

\[5]Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it; let clouds dwell upon it; let darkeners of the day terrify it.
\[6]That night—let gloom seize upon it; let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.
\[7]Behold, let that night be barren; let no joyful sound come therein;
\[8]Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to rouse Leviathan;
\[9]Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it wait for light, and have none, neither let it see the eyelids of the dawn:
\[10]Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, and hid not trouble from mine eyes.
\[11]Wherefore did I not die from the womb,—come forth from the belly and expire?
\[12]Why did the knees meet me? and wherefore the breasts, that I should suck?
\[13]For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
\[14]With kings and counsellors of the earth, who build desolate places for themselves,
\[15]Or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver;
\[16]Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants that have not seen the light.

\[18]The prisoners together are at ease; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.
\[19]The small and great are there, and the bondman freed from his master.
\[20]Wherefore is light given to him that is in trouble, and life to those bitter of soul,
\[21]Who long for death, and it [cometh] not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures;
\[22]Who rejoice even exultingly and are glad when they find the grave?—
\[23]To the man whose way is hidden, and whom +God hath hedged in?
\[24]For my sighing cometh before my bread, and my groanings are poured out like the waters.

\[22]At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh, and of the beasts of the earth thou shalt not be afraid.

\[15]Terrors are turned against me; they pursue mine honour as the wind; and my welfare is passed away like a cloud.

\[21]Thou art changed to a cruel one to me; with the strength of thy hand thou pursuest me.
\[22]Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to be borne away, and dissolvest my substance.
\[23]For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and into the house of assemblage for all living.
\[24]Indeed, no prayer [availeth] when he stretcheth out [his] hand: though they cry when he destroyeth.
\[25]Did not I weep for him whose days were hard? was not my soul grieved for the needy?
\[26]For I expected good, and there came evil; and I waited for light, but there came darkness.
\[27]My bowels well up, and rest not; days of affliction have confronted me.
\[28]I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up, I cry in the congregation.
\[29]I am become a brother to jackals, and a companion of ostriches.
\[30]My skin is become black [and falleth] off me, and my bones are parched with heat.

\[24]He breaketh in pieces mighty men without inquiry, and setteth others in their stead;
\[25]Since he knoweth their actions; and he overthroweth [them] in the night, and they are crushed.
\[26]He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others,
\[27]Because they have turned back from him, and would consider none of his ways;
\[28]So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.

\[30]That the ungodly man reign not, that the people be not ensnared.

\[21]He lieth under lotus-bushes, in the covert of the reed and fen:

\[30]His under parts are sharp potsherds: he spreadeth a threshing-sledge upon the mire.

\[32]He maketh the path to shine after him: one would think the deep to be hoary.

\[11]And all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, came to him, and they ate bread with him in his house, and they condoled with him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him; and every one gave him a piece of money, and every one a golden ring.
\[12]And Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.
\[13]And he had seven sons and three daughters.
\[14]And he called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.
\[15]And in all the land were no women found [so] fair as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.

\[3]I will call upon Jehovah, who is to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
\[4]The bands of death encompassed me, and torrents of Belial made me afraid.
\[5]The bands of Sheol surrounded me, the cords of death encountered me.
\[6]In my distress I called upon Jehovah, and I cried out to my God; he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, into his ears.
\[7]Then the earth shook and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains trembled and shook, because he was wroth.
\[8]There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals burned forth from it.
\[9]And he bowed the heavens, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.
\[10]And he rode upon a cherub and did fly; yea, he flew fast upon the wings of the wind.
\[11]He made darkness his secret place, his tent round about him: darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
\[12]From the brightness before him his thick clouds passed forth: hail and coals of fire.
\[13]And Jehovah thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice: hail and coals of fire.
\[14]And he sent his arrows, and scattered [mine enemies]; and he shot forth lightnings, and discomfited them.
\[15]And the beds of the waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were uncovered at thy rebuke, Jehovah, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
\[16]He reached forth from above, he took me, he drew me out of great waters:
\[17]He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me; for they were mightier than I.
\[18]They encountered me in the day of my calamity, but Jehovah was my stay.
\[19]And he brought me forth into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
\[20]Jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
\[21]For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
\[22]For all his ordinances were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me;
\[23]And I was upright with him, and kept myself from mine iniquity.
\[24]And Jehovah hath recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.
\[25]With the gracious thou dost shew thyself gracious; with the upright man thou dost shew thyself upright;
\[26]With the pure thou dost shew thyself pure; and with the perverse thou dost shew thyself contrary.
\[27]For it is thou that savest the afflicted people; but the haughty eyes wilt thou bring down.
\[28]For it is thou that makest my lamp to shine: Jehovah my God enlighteneth my darkness.
\[29]For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.
\[30]As for God, his way is perfect; the word of Jehovah is tried: he is a shield to all that trust in him.
\[31]For who is +God save Jehovah? and who is a rock if not our God?
\[32]The God who girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect,
\[33]Who maketh my feet like hinds' [feet], and setteth me upon my high places;
\[34]Who teacheth my hands to war, and mine arms bend a bow of brass;
\[35]And thou didst give me the shield of thy salvation, and thy right hand held me up; and thy condescending gentleness hath made me great.
\[36]Thou didst enlarge my steps under me, and mine ankles have not wavered.
\[37]I pursued mine enemies, and overtook them; and I turned not again till they were consumed.
\[38]I crushed them, and they were not able to rise: they fell under my feet.
\[39]And thou girdedst me with strength to battle; thou didst subdue under me those that rose up against me.
\[40]And mine enemies didst thou make to turn their backs unto me, and those that hated me I destroyed.
\[41]They cried, and there was none to save;—unto Jehovah, and he answered them not.
\[42]And I did beat them small as dust before the wind; I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.
\[43]Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; thou hast made me the head of the nations: a people I knew not doth serve me.
\[44]At the hearing of the ear, they obey me: strangers come cringing unto me.
\[45]Strangers have faded away, and they come trembling forth from their close places.
\[46]Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of my salvation,
\[47]The God who hath avenged me, and hath subjected the peoples to me;
\[48]Who hath delivered me from mine enemies: yea, thou hast lifted me up above them that rose up against me; from the man of violence hast thou delivered me.
\[49]Therefore will I give thanks to thee, Jehovah, among the nations, and will sing psalms to thy name.

\[2]I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing; I am come into the depths of waters, and the flood overfloweth me.
\[3]I am weary with my crying, my throat is parched; mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
\[4]They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.
\[5]Thou, O God, knowest my foolishness, and my trespasses are not hidden from thee.
\[6]Let not them that wait on thee, Lord, Jehovah of hosts, be ashamed through me; let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O God of Israel.
\[7]Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; confusion hath covered my face.
\[8]I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's sons;
\[9]For the zeal of thy house hath devoured me, and the reproaches of them that reproach thee have fallen upon me.
\[10]And I wept, my soul was fasting: that also was to my reproach;—
\[11]And I made sackcloth my garment: then I became a proverb to them.
\[12]They that sit in the gate talk of me, and [I am] the song of the drunkards.
\[13]But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, Jehovah, in an acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of thy loving-kindness answer me, according to the truth of thy salvation:
\[14]Deliver me out of the mire, let me not sink; let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the depths of waters.
\[15]Let not the flood of waters overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up; and let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.
\[16]Answer me, O Jehovah; for thy loving-kindness is good: according to the abundance of thy tender mercies, turn toward me;
\[17]And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble: answer me speedily.
\[18]Draw nigh unto my soul, be its redeemer; ransom me because of mine enemies.
\[19]*Thou* knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.
\[20]Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am overwhelmed: and I looked for sympathy, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.
\[21]Yea, they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
\[22]Let their table become a snare before them, and their very welfare a trap;
\[23]Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not, and make their loins continually to shake.
\[24]Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let the fierceness of thine anger take hold of them.
\[25]Let their habitation be desolate; let there be no dweller in their tents.
\[26]For they persecute him whom *thou* hast smitten, and they talk for the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded.
\[27]Add iniquity unto their iniquity, and let them not come into thy righteousness.
\[28]Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the righteous.
\[29]But I am afflicted and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me secure on high.
\[30]I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving;
\[31]And it shall please Jehovah more than an ox,—a bullock with horns and cloven hoofs.
\[32]The meek shall see it, they shall be glad; ye that seek God, your heart shall live.
\[33]For Jehovah heareth the needy, and despiseth not his prisoners.
\[34]Let heavens and earth praise him; the seas, and everything that moveth therein.
\[35]For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah; and they shall dwell there, and possess it:
\[36]And the seed of his servants shall inherit it, and they that love his name shall dwell therein.

\[2]I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter riddles from of old,
\[3]Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us:
\[4]We will not hide [them] from their sons, shewing forth to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, and his strength, and his marvellous works which he hath done.
\[5]For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;
\[6]That the generation to come might know [them], the children that should be born; that they might rise up and tell [them] to their children,
\[7]And that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but observe his commandments;
\[8]And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that prepared not their heart, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
\[9]The sons of Ephraim, armed bowmen, turned back in the day of battle.
\[10]They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
\[11]And forgot his doings, and his marvellous works which he had shewn them.
\[12]In the sight of their fathers had he done wonders, in the land of Egypt, the field of Zoan.
\[13]He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; and made the waters to stand as a heap;
\[14]And he led them with a cloud in the daytime, and all the night with the light of fire.
\[15]He clave rocks in the wilderness, and gave [them] drink as out of the depths, abundantly;
\[16]And he brought streams out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
\[17]Yet they still went on sinning against him, provoking the Most High in the desert;
\[18]And they tempted God in their heart, by asking meat for their lust;
\[19]And they spoke against God: they said, Is God able to prepare a table in the wilderness?
\[20]Behold, he smote the rock, and waters gushed out, and streams overflowed; is he able to give bread also, or provide flesh for his people?
\[21]Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth; and fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against Israel:
\[22]Because they believed not in God, and confided not in his salvation;
\[23]Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of the heavens,
\[24]And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them the corn of the heavens.
\[25]Man did eat the bread of the mighty; he sent them provision to the full.
\[26]He caused the east wind to rise in the heavens, and by his strength he brought the south wind;
\[27]And he rained flesh upon them as dust, and feathered fowl as the sand of the seas,
\[28]And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations:
\[29]And they did eat, and were well filled; for that they lusted after, he brought to them.
\[30]They were not alienated from their lust, their meat was yet in their mouths,
\[31]When the anger of God went up against them; and he slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
\[32]For all this, they sinned still, and believed not in his marvellous works;
\[33]And he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.
\[34]When he slew them, then they sought him, and returned and sought early after God;
\[35]And they remembered that God was their rock, and God, the Most High, their redeemer.
\[36]But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongue;
\[37]For their heart was not firm toward him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
\[38]But he was merciful: he forgave the iniquity, and destroyed [them] not; but many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his fury:
\[39]And he remembered that they were flesh, a breath that passeth away and cometh not again.
\[40]How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!
\[41]And they turned again and tempted God, and grieved the Holy One of Israel.
\[42]They remembered not his hand, the day when he delivered them from the oppressor,
\[43]How he set his signs in Egypt, and his miracles in the field of Zoan;
\[44]And turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, that they could not drink;
\[45]He sent dog-flies among them, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them;
\[46]And he gave their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labour unto the locust;
\[47]He killed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with hail-stones;
\[48]And he delivered up their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to thunderbolts.
\[49]He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and distress,—a mission of angels of woes.
\[50]He made a way for his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
\[51]And he smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the first-fruits of their vigour in the tents of Ham.
\[52]And he made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock;
\[53]And he led them safely, so that they were without fear; and the sea covered their enemies.
\[54]And he brought them to his holy border, this mountain, which his right hand purchased;
\[55]And he drove out the nations before them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
\[56]But they tempted and provoked God, the Most High, and kept not his testimonies,
\[57]And they drew back and dealt treacherously like their fathers: they turned like a deceitful bow.
\[58]And they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
\[59]God heard, and was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
\[60]And he forsook the tabernacle at Shiloh, the tent where he had dwelt among men,
\[61]And gave his strength into captivity, and his glory into the hand of the oppressor;
\[62]And delivered up his people unto the sword, and was very wroth with his inheritance:
\[63]The fire consumed their young men, and their maidens were not praised in [nuptial] song;
\[64]Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.
\[65]Then the Lord awoke as one out of sleep, like a mighty man that shouteth aloud by reason of wine;
\[66]And he smote his adversaries in the hinder part, and put them to everlasting reproach.
\[67]And he rejected the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim,
\[68]But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved;
\[69]And he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he hath founded for ever.
\[70]And he chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
\[71]From following the suckling-ewes, he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
\[72]And he fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and led them by the skilfulness of his hands.

\[25]Of old hast thou founded the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands:

\[4]Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flame of fire.
\[5]He laid the earth upon its foundations: it shall not be removed for ever.
\[6]Thou hadst covered it with the deep, as with a vesture; the waters stood above the mountains:
\[7]At thy rebuke they fled, at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away;—
\[8]The mountains rose, the valleys sank, unto the place which thou hadst founded for them;—
\[9]Thou hast set a bound which they may not pass over, that they turn not again to cover the earth.

\[12]The birds of heaven dwell by them; they give forth their voice from among the branches.
\[13]He watereth the mountains from his upper-chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
\[14]He maketh the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man; bringing forth bread out of the earth,
\[15]And wine which gladdeneth the heart of man; making [his] face shine with oil; and with bread he strengtheneth man's heart.

\[17]Where the birds make their nests; [as for] the stork, the fir trees are her house.
\[18]The high mountains are for the wild goats; the cliffs, a refuge for the rock-badgers.
\[19]He made the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth its going down.
\[20]Thou makest darkness, and it is night, wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth:
\[21]The young lions roar after the prey, and to seek their food from God.
\[22]The sun ariseth, they retreat, and lay them down in their dens.
\[23]Man goeth forth unto his work, and to his labour until the evening.

\[26]There go the ships; [there] that leviathan, which thou hast formed to play therein.
\[27]These all look unto thee, that thou mayest give their food in its season:
\[28]That thou givest unto them, they gather; thou openest thy hand, they are filled with good.
\[29]Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; thou takest away their breath, they expire and return to their dust.
\[30]Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created, and thou renewest the face of the earth.
\[31]The glory of Jehovah will endure for ever; Jehovah will rejoice in his works.
\[32]He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.
\[33]I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live; I will sing psalms to my God while I have my being.

\[7]He, Jehovah, is our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
\[8]He is ever mindful of his covenant,—the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,—
\[9]Which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;

\[11]Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;
\[12]When they were a few men in number, of small account, and strangers in it.
\[13]And they went from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people.

\[21]He made him lord of his house, and ruler over all his possessions:
\[22]To bind his princes at his pleasure, and teach his elders wisdom.
\[23]And Israel came into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
\[24]And he made his people exceeding fruitful, and made them mightier than their oppressors.
\[25]He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.
\[26]He sent Moses his servant, [and] Aaron whom he had chosen:
\[27]They set his signs among them, and miracles in the land of Ham.
\[28]He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.
\[29]He turned their waters into blood, and caused their fish to die.
\[30]Their land swarmed with frogs,—in the chambers of their kings.
\[31]He spoke, and there came dog-flies, [and] gnats in all their borders.
\[32]He gave them hail for rain, [and] flaming fire in their land;
\[33]And he smote their vines and their fig-trees, and broke the trees of their borders.
\[34]He spoke, and the locust came, and the cankerworm, even without number;
\[35]And they devoured every herb in their land, and ate up the fruit of their ground.
\[36]And he smote every firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their vigour.
\[37]And he brought them forth with silver and gold; and there was not one feeble among their tribes.
\[38]Egypt rejoiced at their departure; for the fear of them had fallen upon them.
\[39]He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light in the night.
\[40]They asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
\[41]He opened the rock, and waters gushed forth; they ran in the dry places [like] a river.
\[42]For he remembered his holy word, [and] Abraham his servant;
\[43]And he brought forth his people with gladness, his chosen with rejoicing;

\[6]We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
\[7]Our fathers in Egypt considered not thy wondrous works; they remembered not the multitude of thy loving-kindnesses; but they rebelled at the sea, at the Red Sea.

\[17]The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram;
\[18]And fire was kindled in their company; a flame burned up the wicked.
\[19]They made a calf in Horeb, and did homage to a molten image;
\[20]And they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.
\[21]They forgot God their Saviour, who had done great things in Egypt,
\[22]Wondrous works in the land of Ham, terrible things by the Red Sea.
\[23]And he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses, his chosen, stood before him in the breach, to turn away his fury, lest he should destroy [them].
\[24]And they despised the pleasant land; they believed not his word,
\[25]But murmured in their tents: they hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.
\[26]And he lifted up his hand to them, that he would make them fall in the wilderness;
\[27]And that he would make their seed fall among the nations, and disperse them through the countries.
\[28]And they joined themselves unto Baal-Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead;
\[29]And they provoked [him] to anger with their doings; and a plague broke out among them.
\[30]Then stood up Phinehas and executed judgment, and the plague was stayed;
\[31]And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, from generation to generation, for evermore.
\[32]And they moved him to wrath at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account;
\[33]For they provoked his spirit, so that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips.
\[34]They did not destroy the peoples, as Jehovah commanded them;
\[35]But they mingled with the nations, and learned their works;
\[36]And they served their idols; and they were a snare unto them:
\[37]And they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,
\[38]And shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.
\[39]And they were defiled with their works, and went a-whoring in their doings.
\[40]Then was the anger of Jehovah kindled against his people, and he abhorred his inheritance;
\[41]And he gave them into the hand of the nations; and they that hated them ruled over them:
\[42]And their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
\[43]Often did he deliver them; but as for them they provoked [him] by their counsel, and they were brought low by their iniquity.
\[44]But he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry;
\[45]And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses;
\[46]And he caused them to find compassion of all those that had carried them captives.
\[47]Save us, Jehovah our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, [and] to triumph in thy praise.

\[37]And sow fields, and plant vineyards, which yield fruits of increase;
\[38]And he blesseth them, so that they are multiplied greatly; and he suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
\[39]And they are diminished and brought low, through oppression, adversity, and sorrow:

roverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
\[2]to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;
\[3]to receive the instruction of wisdom, righteousness and judgment, and equity;
\[4]to give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.
\[5]He that is wise will hear, and will increase learning; and the intelligent will gain wise counsels:
\[6]to understand a proverb and an allegory, the words of the wise and their enigmas.
\[7]The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge: fools despise wisdom and instruction.
\[8]Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;
\[9]for they shall be a garland of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.
\[10]My son, if sinners entice thee, consent not.
\[11]If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;
\[12]let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those that go down into the pit;
\[13]we shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:
\[14]cast in thy lot among us; we will all have one purse:
\[15]—my son, walk not in the way with them, keep back thy foot from their path;
\[16]for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.
\[17]For in vain the net is spread in the sight of anything which hath wings.
\[18]And these lay wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly for their own lives.
\[19]So are the paths of every one that is greedy of gain: it taketh away the life of its possessors.
\[20]Wisdom crieth without; she raiseth her voice in the broadways;
\[21]she calleth in the chief [place] of concourse, in the entry of the gates; in the city she uttereth her words:
\[22]How long, simple ones, will ye love simpleness, and scorners take pleasure in their scorning, and the foolish hate knowledge?
\[23]Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour forth my spirit unto you, I will make known to you my words.
\[24]Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one regarded;
\[25]and ye have rejected all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
\[26]I also will laugh in your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh;
\[27]when your fear cometh as sudden destruction, and your calamity cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come upon you:
\[28]—then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me early, and shall not find me.
\[29]Because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of Jehovah;
\[30]they would none of my counsel, they despised all my reproof:
\[31]therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their way, and be filled with their own devices.
\[32]For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of the foolish shall cause them to perish.
\[33]But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be at rest from fear of evil.

\[10]When wisdom entereth into thy heart and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul,

\[25]Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the destruction of the wicked, when it cometh;

\[28]Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to-morrow I will give, when thou hast it by thee.
\[29]Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
\[30]Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.
\[31]Envy not the man of violence, and choose none of his ways.
\[32]For the perverse is an abomination to Jehovah; but his secret is with the upright.
\[33]The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked; but he blesseth the habitation of the righteous.

\[20]My son, observe thy father's commandment, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;
\[21]bind them continually upon thy heart, tie them about thy neck:
\[22]when thou walkest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and [when] thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.

\[28]Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?

\[32]Whoso committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
\[33]A wound and contempt shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.

\[4]Lofty eyes, and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, is sin.
\[5]The thoughts of the diligent [tend] only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty, only to want.
\[6]The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting breath of them that seek death.
\[7]The devastation of the wicked sweepeth them away, because they refuse to do what is right.
\[8]Very crooked is the way of a guilty man; but as for the pure, his work is upright.
\[9]It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a contentious woman, and a house in common.
\[10]The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.
\[11]When the scorner is punished, the simple becometh wise; and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.
\[12]One that is righteous wisely considereth the house of the wicked: he overthroweth the wicked to [their] ruin.
\[13]Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also himself shall cry, and shall not be heard.
\[14]A gift in secret pacifieth anger; and a present in the bosom, vehement fury.
\[15]It is joy to a righteous [man] to do what is right; but it is ruin for the workers of iniquity.
\[16]The man that wandereth out of the way of wisdom shall abide in the congregation of the dead.
\[17]He that loveth mirth shall be a poor man; he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.
\[18]The wicked is a ransom for the righteous, and a treacherous [man] in the stead of the upright.
\[19]It is better to dwell in a desert land. than with a contentious and irritable woman.
\[20]There is costly store and oil in the dwelling of a wise [man]; but a foolish man swalloweth it up.
\[21]He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.
\[22]A wise [man] scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.
\[23]Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.
\[24]Proud, arrogant, scorner is his name who dealeth in proud wrath.
\[25]The desire of the sluggard killeth him; for his hands refuse to work:
\[26]He coveteth greedily all the day long; but the righteous giveth and spareth not.
\[27]The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more when they bring it with a wicked purpose!
\[28]A lying witness shall perish; and a man that heareth shall speak constantly.
\[29]A wicked man hardeneth his face; but as for the upright, he establisheth his way.
\[30]There is no wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against Jehovah.
\[31]The horse is prepared for the day of battle; but safety is of Jehovah.

\[21]My son, fear Jehovah and the king: meddle not with them that are given to change.

\[2]It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the glory of kings is to search out a thing.
\[3]The heavens for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.
\[4]Take away the dross from the silver, and there cometh forth a vessel for the refiner:
\[5]take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.
\[6]Put not thyself forward in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of the great;
\[7]for better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither, than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes see.
\[8]Go not forth hastily to strive, lest [thou know not] what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.
\[9]Debate thy cause with thy neighbour, but reveal not the secret of another;
\[10]lest he that heareth [it] disgrace thee, and thine evil report turn not away.
\[11][As] apples of gold in pictures of silver, is a word spoken in season.
\[12]An ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, is a wise reprover upon an attentive ear.
\[13]As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, [so] is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.
\[14]Clouds and wind without rain, [so] is a man that boasteth himself of a false gift.
\[15]By long forbearing is a ruler persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.
\[16]Hast thou found honey? Eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be surfeited therewith, and vomit it.
\[17]Let thy foot be seldom in thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee and hate thee.
\[18]A maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow, is a man that beareth false witness against his neighbour.
\[19]A broken tooth, and a tottering foot, is confidence in an unfaithful [man] in the day of trouble.
\[20][As] he that taketh off a garment in cold weather, [and as] vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to a sad heart.
\[21]If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
\[22]for thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and Jehovah shall reward thee.
\[23]The north wind bringeth forth rain, and the angry countenance a backbiting tongue.
\[24]It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a contentious woman, and a house in common.
\[25][As] cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.
\[26]A troubled fountain, and a defiled well, is a righteous [man] that giveth way before the wicked.

\[4]Who hath ascended up into the heavens, and descended? Who hath gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath bound the waters in a mantle? Who hath established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou knowest?

\[8]Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the bread of my daily need:
\[9]lest I be full and deny [thee], and say, Who is Jehovah? or lest I be poor and steal, and outrage the name of my God.

\[23]under an odious [woman] when she is married, and a handmaid when she is heir to her mistress.
\[24]There are four [things] little upon the earth, and they are exceeding wise:
\[25]The ants, a people not strong, yet they provide their food in the summer;
\[26]the rock-badgers are but a feeble folk, yet they make their house in the cliff;
\[27]the locusts have no king, yet they go forth all of them by bands;
\[28]thou takest hold of the lizard with the hands, yet is she in kings' palaces.
\[29]There are three [things] which have a stately step, and four are comely in going:
\[30]The lion, mighty among beasts, which turneth not away for any;
\[31]a [horse] girt in the loins; or the he-goat; and a king, against whom none can rise up.
\[32]If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, [lay] the hand upon thy mouth.
\[33]For the pressing of milk bringeth forth butter, and the pressing of the nose bringeth forth blood; and the pressing of anger bringeth forth strife.

\[2]What, my son? and what, O son of my womb? and what, O son of my vows?
\[3]Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to them that destroy kings.
\[4]It is not for kings, Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, nor for rulers [to say], Where is the strong drink?
\[5]—lest they drink and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the children of affliction.
\[6]Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto the bitter of soul:
\[7]let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
\[8]Open thy mouth for the dumb, for the cause of all those that are left desolate.
\[9]Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and minister justice to the afflicted and needy.
\[10]Who can find a woman of worth? for her price is far above rubies.
\[11]The heart of her husband confideth in her, and he shall have no lack of spoil.
\[12]She doeth him good, and not evil, all the days of her life.
\[13]She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.
\[14]She is like the merchants' ships: she bringeth her food from afar;
\[15]And she riseth while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and the day's work to her maidens.
\[16]She considereth a field, and acquireth it; of the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.
\[17]She girdeth her loins with strength, and maketh strong her arms.
\[18]She perceiveth that her earning is good; her lamp goeth not out by night.
\[19]She putteth her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.
\[20]She stretcheth out her hand to the afflicted, and she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
\[21]She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her household are clothed with scarlet.
\[22]She maketh herself coverlets; her clothing is byssus and purple.
\[23]Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.
\[24]She maketh body linen and selleth it, and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.
\[25]Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laugheth [at] the coming day.
\[26]She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and upon her tongue is the law of kindness.
\[27]She surveyeth the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.
\[28]Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband [also], and he praiseth her:
\[29]Many daughters have done worthily, but thou excellest them all.
\[30]Gracefulness is deceitful and beauty is vain; a woman [that] feareth Jehovah, she shall be praised.
\[31]Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in the gates.

he words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
\[2]Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities! all is vanity.
\[3]What profit hath man of all his labour wherewith he laboureth under the sun?
\[4][One] generation passeth away, and [another] generation cometh, but the earth standeth for ever.
\[5]The sun also riseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth.
\[6]The wind goeth towards the south, and turneth about towards the north: it turneth about continually, and the wind returneth again to its circuits.
\[7]All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full: unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again.
\[8]All things are full of toil; none can express it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
\[9]That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which will be done: and there is nothing new under the sun.
\[10]Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? It hath been already in the ages which were before us.
\[11]There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be remembrance of things that are to come with those who shall live afterwards.
\[12]I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
\[13]And I applied my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the heavens: this grievous occupation hath God given to the children of men to weary themselves therewith.
\[14]I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and pursuit of the wind.
\[15]That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
\[16]I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have become great and have acquired wisdom more than all they that have been before me over Jerusalem; and my heart hath seen much of wisdom and knowledge.
\[17]And I applied my heart to the knowledge of wisdom, and to the knowledge of madness and folly: I perceived that this also is a striving after the wind.
\[18]For in much wisdom is much vexation, and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.

 said in my heart, Come now, I will try thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure. But behold, this also is vanity.
\[2]I said of laughter, Madness! and of mirth, What availeth it?
\[3]I searched in my heart how to cherish my flesh with wine, while practising my heart with wisdom; and how to lay hold on folly, till I should see what was that good for the children of men which they should do under the heavens all the days of their life.
\[4]I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;
\[5]I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of every kind of fruit;
\[6]I made me ponds of water, to water therewith the wood, where the trees are reared.
\[7]I acquired servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that had been in Jerusalem before me.
\[8]I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces; I got me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the children of men, a wife and concubines.
\[9]And I became great, and increased more than all that had been before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
\[10]And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them: I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour, and this was my portion from all my labour.
\[11]Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that it had cost me to do [them]; and behold, all was vanity and pursuit of the wind, and there was no profit under the sun.
\[12]And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly; for what shall the man [do] that cometh after the king?—that which hath already been done.
\[13]And I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as light excelleth darkness.
\[14]The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness; but I myself also perceived that one event happeneth to them all.
\[15]And I said in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool so will it happen even to me; and why was I then so wise? Then I said in my heart that this also is vanity.
\[16]For there shall be no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; because everything is already forgotten in the days which come. And how dieth the wise even as the fool?
\[17]And I hated life; for the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and pursuit of the wind.
\[18]And I hated all my labour wherewith I had been toiling under the sun, because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
\[19]And who knoweth whether he will be a wise [man] or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour at which I have laboured, and wherein I have been wise under the sun. This also is vanity.
\[20]Then I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour wherewith I had laboured under the sun.
\[21]For there is a man whose labour hath been with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skill, and who leaveth it to a man that hath not laboured therein, to be his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.
\[22]For what will man have of all his labour and of the striving of his heart, wherewith he hath wearied himself under the sun?
\[23]For all his days are sorrows, and his travail vexation: even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity.
\[24]There is nothing good for man, but that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.
\[25]For who can eat, or who be eager, more than I?
\[26]For he giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good in God's sight. This also is vanity and pursuit of the wind.

\[3]A time to kill, and a time to heal; A time to break down, and a time to build up;
\[4]A time to weep, and a time to laugh; A time to mourn, and a time to dance;
\[5]A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
\[6]A time to seek, and a time to lose; A time to keep, and a time to cast away;

\[8]A time to love, and a time to hate; A time of war, and a time of peace.
\[9]What profit hath he that worketh from that wherein he laboureth?
\[10]I have seen the travail that God hath given to the sons of men to toil in.
\[11]He hath made everything beautiful in its time; also he hath set the world in their heart, so that man findeth not out from the beginning to the end the work that God doeth.
\[12]I know that there is nothing good for them but to rejoice and to do well in their life;
\[13]yea also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labour, it is the gift of God.
\[14]I know that whatever God doeth, it shall be for ever; there is nothing to be added to it, nor anything to be taken from it; and God doeth [it], that [men] should fear before him.
\[15]That which is was long ago, and that which is to be hath already been; and God bringeth back again that which is past.
\[16]And moreover I saw under the sun, that in the place of judgment, wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, wickedness was there.
\[17]I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.
\[18]I said in my heart, It is thus with the children of men, that God may prove them, and that they should see that they themselves are but beasts.
\[19]For what befalleth the children of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other, and they have all one breath; and man hath no pre-eminence above the beast: for all is vanity.
\[20]All go unto one place: all are of the dust, and all return to dust.
\[21]Who knoweth the spirit of the children of men? Doth it go upwards? and the spirit of the beasts, doth it go downwards to the earth?
\[22]And I have seen that there is nothing better than that man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion; for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

\[2]Then I praised the dead who are already dead more than the living who are yet alive;
\[3]and more fortunate than both is he who hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
\[4]And I saw all labour, and all success of work, that it is man's jealousy of his neighbour. This also is vanity and pursuit of the wind.
\[5]The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
\[6]Better is a handful with quietness, than both hands full with labour and pursuit of the wind.

\[9]Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.
\[10]For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and who hath not another to lift him up!
\[11]Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one alone be warm?
\[12]And if a [man] overpower the one, the two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
\[13]Better is a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth no more how to be admonished.
\[14]For out of the prison-house he came forth to reign, although he was born poor in his kingdom.
\[15]I saw all the living that walk under the sun, with the child, the second, that should stand up in his stead.

eep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and draw near to hear, rather than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they know not that they do evil.
\[2]Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before God: for God is in the heavens, and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be few.
\[3]For a dream cometh through the multitude of business, and a fool's voice through a multitude of words.
\[4]When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.
\[5]Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.
\[6]Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an inadvertence. Wherefore should God be wroth at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?
\[7]For in the multitude of dreams are vanities; so with many words: but fear God.
\[8]If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter; for a higher than the high is watching, and there are higher than they.
\[9]Moreover the earth is every way profitable: the king [himself] is dependent upon the field.
\[10]He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver, nor he that loveth abundance with increase. This also is vanity.

\[13]There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt;
\[14]or those riches perish by some evil circumstance, and if he have begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand.
\[15]As he came forth from his mother's womb, naked shall he go away again as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.
\[16]And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came so doth he go away, and what profit hath he, in having laboured for the wind?
\[17]All his days also he eateth in darkness, and hath much vexation, and sickness, and irritation.
\[18]Behold what I have seen good and comely: [it is] to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labour wherewith [man] laboureth under the sun, all the days of his life which God hath given him: for that is his portion.
\[19]Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and power to eat thereof, and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labour: that is a gift of God.

\[19]Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty [men] that are in a city.
\[20]Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not.

\[8]There is no man who hath control over the spirit to retain the spirit; and no one hath control over the day of death; and there is no discharge in that war, neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.

\[11]If the serpent bite before enchantment, then the charmer hath no advantage.
\[12]The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool swallow up himself.
\[13]The beginning of the words of his mouth is folly; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.

\[15]The labour of fools wearieth them, because they know not how to go to the city.

\[11]The words of the wise are as goads, and the collections [of them] as nails fastened in: they are given from one shepherd.

\[2]Hear, [ye] heavens, and give ear, [thou] earth! for Jehovah hath spoken: I have nourished and brought up children; and they have rebelled against me.
\[3]The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib; Israel doth not know, my people hath no intelligence.
\[4]Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that corrupt themselves! They have forsaken Jehovah; they have despised the Holy One of Israel; they are turned away backward.
\[5]Why should ye be smitten any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
\[6]From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in him; wounds, and weals, and open sores: they have not been dressed, nor bound up, nor mollified with oil.
\[7]Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers eat it up in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
\[8]And the daughter of Zion is left, as a booth in a vineyard, as a night-lodge in a cucumber-garden, as a besieged city.
\[9]Unless Jehovah of hosts had left us a very small residue, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.
\[10]Hear the word of Jehovah, rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, people of Gomorrah!
\[11]To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith Jehovah. I am sated with burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and in the blood of bullocks, and of lambs, and of he-goats I take no pleasure.
\[12]When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this from your hand—to tread my courts?
\[13]Bring no more vain oblations! Incense is an abomination unto me,—new moon and sabbath, the calling of convocations—wickedness and the solemn meeting I cannot bear.
\[14]Your new moons and your set feasts my soul hateth: they are a burden to me; I am wearied of bearing [them].
\[15]And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
\[16]Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes;—cease to do evil,
\[17]learn to do well: seek judgment, gladden the oppressed, do justice to the fatherless, plead for the widow.
\[18]Come now, let us reason together, saith Jehovah: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
\[19]If ye be willing and hearken, ye shall eat the good of the land;
\[20]but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken.
\[21]How is the faithful city become a harlot! It was full of judgment; righteousness used to lodge in it, but now murderers.
\[22]Thy silver is become dross, thy wine is mixed with water:
\[23]thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth presents, and hunteth after rewards; they judge not the fatherless, and the cause of the widow cometh not unto them.
\[24]Therefore saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Ah! I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies.
\[25]And I will turn my hand upon thee, and will thoroughly purge away thy dross, and take away all thine alloy;
\[26]and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning. Afterwards thou shalt be called, Town of righteousness, Faithful city.
\[27]Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and they that return of her with righteousness.
\[28]But the ruin of the transgressors and of the sinners [shall be] together; and they that forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.
\[29]For they shall be ashamed of the terebinths that ye have desired, and ye shall blush for the gardens that ye have chosen.
\[30]For ye shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.

\[3]And many peoples shall go and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and Jehovah's word from Jerusalem.
\[4]And he shall judge among the nations, and shall reprove many peoples; and they shall forge their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-knives: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.

\[6]For thou hast cast off thy people, the house of Jacob, because they are filled [with what comes] from the east, and use auguries like the Philistines, and ally themselves with the children of foreigners.

\[11]The lofty eyes of man shall be brought low, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.

\[13]and upon all the cedars of Lebanon, high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan;
\[14]and upon all the lofty mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up;
\[15]and upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall;
\[16]and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant works of art.
\[17]And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low; and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day:
\[18]and the idols shall utterly pass away.
\[19]And they shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall arise to terrify the earth.
\[20]In that day men shall cast away their idols of silver and their idols of gold, which they made [each] for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;

\[16]And Jehovah said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched-out neck and wanton eyes, and go along mincing, and making a tinkling with their feet;
\[17]therefore the Lord will make bald the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts.

\[19]the pearl-drops, and the bracelets, and the veils,
\[20]the head-dresses, and the stepping chains, and the girdles, and the scent-boxes, and the amulets;

 will sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard: My well-beloved had a vineyard upon a fruitful hill.
\[2]And he dug it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine; and he built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress therein; and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, but it brought forth wild grapes.
\[3]And now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.
\[4]What was there yet to do to my vineyard that I have not done in it? Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?—
\[5]And now, let me tell you what I am about to do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten up; I will break down its wall, and it shall be trodden under foot;
\[6]and I will make it a waste—it shall not be pruned nor cultivated, but there shall come up briars and thorns; and I will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
\[7]For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah the plant of his delight: and he looked for justice, and behold, blood-shedding; for righteousness, and behold, a cry.
\[8]Woe unto them that add house to house, that join field to field, until there is no more room, and that ye dwell yourselves alone in the midst of the land!
\[9]In mine ears Jehovah of hosts [hath said], Many houses shall assuredly become a desolation, great and excellent ones, without inhabitant.
\[10]Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield an ephah.
\[11]Woe unto them that, rising early in the morning, run after strong drink; that linger till twilight, [till] wine inflameth them!
\[12]And harp and lyre, tambour and flute, and wine are in their banquets; but they regard not the work of Jehovah, nor do they see the operation of his hands.
\[13]Therefore my people are led away captive from lack of knowledge, and their nobility die of famine, and their multitude are parched with thirst.
\[14]Therefore doth Sheol enlarge its desire, and open its mouth without measure; and her splendour shall descend [into it], and her multitude, and her tumult, and [all] that is joyful within her.
\[15]And the mean man shall be bowed down, and the great man brought low, and the eyes of the lofty shall be brought low;
\[16]and Jehovah of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and the holy God hallowed in righteousness.
\[17]And the lambs shall feed as on their pasture, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
\[18]Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as with cart-ropes!
\[19]who say, Let him hasten, let him speed his work, that we may see [it]; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!
\[20]Woe unto them who call evil good, and good evil; who put darkness for light, and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
\[21]Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and intelligent in their own esteem!
\[22]Woe unto them that are mighty for drinking wine, and men valiant to mix strong drink;
\[23]who justify the wicked for a bribe, and turn away the righteousness of the righteous from them!
\[24]Therefore as a tongue of fire devoureth the stubble, and dry grass sinketh down in the flame, their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; for they have rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
\[25]Therefore is the anger of Jehovah kindled against his people, and he hath stretched out his hand against them and hath smitten them; and the mountains trembled, and their carcases are become as dung in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.
\[26]And he will lift up a banner to the nations afar off, and will hiss for one from the end of the earth; and behold, it will come rapidly [and] lightly.
\[27]None among them is weary, none stumbleth; they slumber not, nor sleep; none hath the girdle of his loins loosed, nor the thong of his sandals broken;
\[28]their arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses' hoofs are reckoned as the flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind.
\[29]Their roaring is like a lioness, they roar as the young lions; yea, they growl, and snatch the prey, and carry it away safe, and there is none to deliver;
\[30]and they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea. And if one look upon the earth, behold darkness [and] distress, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.

\[2]Seraphim were standing above him: each had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he flew.
\[3]And one called to the other and said, Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!
\[4]And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
\[5]And I said, Woe unto me! for I am undone; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.
\[6]And one of the seraphim flew unto me, and he had in his hand a glowing coal, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;
\[7]and he made it touch my mouth, and said, Behold, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin expiated.
\[8]And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? And I said, Here am I; send me.
\[9]And he said, Go; and thou shalt say unto this people, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive.
\[10]Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and healed.
\[11]And I said, Lord, how long? And he said, Until the cities be wasted, without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land become an utter desolation,
\[12]and Jehovah have removed men far away, and the solitude be great in the midst of the land.

nd it came to pass in the days of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, [that] Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to make war against it, but they were not able to fight against it.
\[2]And it was told the house of David saying, Syria is allied with Ephraim. Then his heart and the heart of his people shook, as the trees of the forest are shaken with the wind.
\[3]And Jehovah said to Isaiah, Go out now to meet Ahaz, thou and thy son Shear-jashub, at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller's field;
\[4]and thou shalt say unto him, Take heed and be quiet; fear not, and let not thy heart faint before these two ends of smoking firebrands, because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
\[5]Inasmuch as Syria hath taken evil counsel against thee, Ephraim [also] and the son of Remaliah, saying,
\[6]Let us go up against Judah, and harass it, and make a breach therein for us, and set up a king therein—the son of Tabeal;
\[7]thus saith the Lord Jehovah: It shall not stand, nor come to pass;
\[8]for the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within sixty-five years shall Ephraim be broken, so as to be no [more a] people;
\[9]and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye believe not, surely ye shall not be established.
\[10]And Jehovah spoke again to Ahaz, saying,
\[11]Ask for thee a sign from Jehovah thy God; ask for it in the deep, or in the height above.
\[12]And Ahaz said, I will not ask, and will not tempt Jehovah.
\[13]And he said, Hear then, house of David: Is it a small matter for you to weary men, that ye weary also my God?
\[14]Therefore will the Lord himself give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son, and call his name Immanuel.
\[15]Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and to choose the good.
\[16]For before the child knoweth to refuse the evil and to choose the good, the land whose two kings thou fearest shall be forsaken.
\[17]Jehovah will bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days which have not come since the day when Ephraim turned away from Judah—[even] the king of Assyria.
\[18]And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will hiss for the fly which is at the extremity of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee which is in the land of Assyria;
\[19]and they shall come and settle all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and on all thorn-bushes, and on all the pastures.
\[20]In that day will the Lord, with a razor which is hired beyond the river, with the king of Assyria, shave the head and the hair of the feet, yea, the beard also will it take away.
\[21]And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] a man shall nourish a young cow and two sheep,
\[22]and it shall come to pass, from the abundance of milk they shall give, [that] he shall eat butter; for every one that remaineth in the midst of the land shall eat butter and honey.
\[23]And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] every place, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver pieces, shall become briars and thorns:
\[24]with arrows and with the bow shall they come thither, for the whole land shall become briars and thorns.
\[25]And all mountains that have been dug up with the hoe—thither will they not come, from fear of briars and thorns; and they shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of small cattle.

\[10]Settle a plan, and it shall come to nought; speak a word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.

\[12]Ye shall not say, Conspiracy, of everything of which this people saith, Conspiracy; and fear ye not their fear, and be not in dread.
\[13]Jehovah of hosts, him shall ye sanctify; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.
\[14]And he will be for a sanctuary; and for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[15]And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
\[16]Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
\[17]And I will wait for Jehovah, who hideth his face from the house of Jacob; and I will look for him.

\[3]And it shall come to pass in the day that Jehovah shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and from thy trouble and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,

\[20]Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial; for thou hast destroyed thy land, hast slain thy people. Of the seed of evildoers no mention shall be made for ever.
\[21]Prepare ye slaughter for his children, because of the iniquity of their fathers; that they may not rise up and possess the earth, nor fill the face of the world with cities.

\[23]And I will make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water; and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith Jehovah of hosts.
\[24]Jehovah of hosts hath sworn saying, Assuredly as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, it shall stand:
\[25]to break the Assyrian in my land; and upon my mountains will I tread him under foot; and his yoke shall depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.
\[26]This is the counsel which is purposed concerning the whole earth; and this is the hand which is stretched out upon all the nations.
\[27]For Jehovah of hosts hath purposed, and who shall frustrate [it]? And his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?
\[28]In the year of the death of king Ahaz was this burden:
\[29]Rejoice not thou, Philistia, all of thee, because the rod that smote thee is broken; for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a viper, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.
\[30]And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety; but I will kill thy root with famine, and thy remnant shall be slain.
\[31]Howl, O gate! cry, O city! thou, Philistia, art wholly dissolved; for there cometh from the north a smoke, and none remaineth apart in his gatherings [of troops].
\[32]And what shall be answered to the messengers of the nation? That Jehovah hath founded Zion, and the afflicted of his people find refuge in it.

\[2]For thou hast made of the city a heap, of the fortified town a ruin, the palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built up.
\[3]Therefore shall the mighty people glorify thee, the city of terrible nations shall fear thee.
\[4]For thou hast been a fortress to the poor, a fortress for the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat: for the blast of the terrible ones [has been] as the storm [against] a wall.
\[5]Thou hast subdued the tumult of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; [as] the heat, by the shadow of a cloud, [so] the song of the terrible ones is brought low.
\[6]And in this mountain will Jehovah of hosts make unto all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.
\[7]And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the veil which veileth all the peoples, and the covering that is spread over all the nations.
\[8]He will swallow up death in victory. And the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his people will he take away from off all the earth: for Jehovah hath spoken.
\[9]And it shall be said in that day, Behold, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is Jehovah, we have waited for him; we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
\[10]For in this mountain shall the hand of Jehovah rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, as straw is trodden down in the dunghill;
\[11]and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth them forth to swim; and he shall bring down their pride together with the plots of their hands.
\[12]And the fortress of the high defences of thy walls will he bring down, lay low, bring to the ground, into the dust.

\[4]Confide ye in Jehovah for ever; for in Jah, Jehovah, is the rock of ages.
\[5]For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low, he layeth it low to the ground, he bringeth it even to the dust.
\[6]The foot shall tread it down,—the feet of the afflicted, the steps of the poor.
\[7]The way of the just is uprightness: thou, the Upright, dost make the path of the just even.
\[8]Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O Jehovah, have we waited for thee; the desire of [our] soul is to thy name, and to thy memorial.
\[9]With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
\[10]If favour be shewn to the wicked, he doth not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness he dealeth unjustly, and beholdeth not the majesty of Jehovah.
\[11]Jehovah, thy hand is lifted up, but they do not see: [yet] they shall see [thy] jealousy [for] the people, and be ashamed; yea, the fire which is for thine adversaries shall devour them.
\[12]Jehovah, thou wilt ordain peace for us; for thou also hast wrought all our works for us.
\[13]Jehovah our God, other lords than thee have had dominion over us; by thee only will we make mention of thy name.
\[14][They are] dead, they shall not live; deceased, they shall not rise: for thou hast visited and destroyed them, and made all memory of them to perish.
\[15]Thou hast increased the nation, Jehovah, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified. Thou hadst removed [it] far [unto] all the ends of the earth.
\[16]Jehovah, in trouble they sought thee; they poured out [their] whispered prayer when thy chastening was upon them.
\[17]As a woman with child, that draweth near her delivery, is in travail, [and] crieth out in her pangs; so have we been before thee, Jehovah.
\[18]We have been with child, we have been in travail, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought the deliverance of the land, neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
\[19]Thy dead shall live, my dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing in triumph, ye that dwell in dust; for thy dew is the dew of the morning, and the earth shall cast forth the dead.
\[20]Come, my people, enter into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself just for a little moment, until the indignation be past.

\[3]The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under feet;
\[4]and the fading flower of his glorious adornment which is on the head of the fat valley shall be like an early fig before the summer: as soon as he that seeth it perceiveth it, scarcely is it in his hand, he swalloweth it down.

\[6]and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.
\[7]But these also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are they gone astray. The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink; they are overpowered by wine, they are gone astray through strong drink; they have erred in vision, they have stumbled [in] judgment.

\[11]For with stammering lips and a strange tongue will he speak to this people;
\[12]to whom he said, This is the rest: cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing. But they would not hear.
\[13]And the word of Jehovah was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little: that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
\[14]Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem.
\[15]For ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol have we made an agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves.
\[16]Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I lay for foundation in Zion a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner-stone, a sure foundation: he that trusteth shall not make haste.
\[17]And I will appoint judgment for a line, and righteousness for a plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.
\[18]And your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, ye shall be trodden down by it.
\[19]As it passeth through it shall take you; for morning by morning shall it pass through, by day and by night; and it shall be terror only to understand the report.
\[20]For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on, and the covering too narrow when he would wrap himself in it.
\[21]For Jehovah will rise up as on mount Perazim, he will be moved with anger as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his strange work, and perform his act, his unwonted act.
\[22]Now therefore be ye not scorners, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of hosts a consumption, and [one] determined, upon the whole land.
\[23]Give ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.
\[24]Doth the ploughman plough all day to sow? Is he [all day] opening and breaking the clods of his land?
\[25]Doth he not, when he hath levelled the face thereof, cast abroad dill, and scatter cummin, and set the wheat in rows, and the barley in an appointed place, and the rye in its border?
\[26]His God doth instruct him in [his] judgment, he doth teach him.
\[27]For the dill is not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart-wheel turned about upon the cummin; but dill is beaten out with a staff, and cummin with a rod.
\[28]Bread [corn] is crushed, because he will not ever be threshing it; and if he drove the wheels of his cart and his horses [over it], he would not crush it.

\[7]And the multitude of all the nations that war against Ariel, even all that war against her and her fortifications, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.
\[8]It shall even be as when the hungry dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; and he awaketh, and his soul is empty; or as when the thirsty dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; and he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul craveth: so shall the multitude of all the nations be that war against mount Zion.
\[9]Be astounded and astonished, blind yourselves and be blind! They are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.

\[11]And the whole vision is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which they give to one that can read, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed.
\[12]And they give the book to him that cannot read, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot read.
\[13]And the Lord saith, Forasmuch as this people draw near with their mouth, and honour me with their lips, but their heart is removed far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment taught of men;
\[14]therefore, behold, I will proceed to do marvellously with this people, to do marvellously, even with wonder, and the wisdom of their wise [men] shall perish, and the understanding of their intelligent ones shall be hid.

\[19]and the meek shall increase their joy in Jehovah, and the needy among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

\[23]for when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall hallow my name, and hallow the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.

\[11]get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us!

\[13]therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a towering wall, whose breaking shall come suddenly in an instant.
\[14]And he shall break it as the breaking of a potter's vessel, that is broken in pieces unsparingly; and in the pieces of it there shall not be found a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to scoop water out of the cistern.

\[16]And ye said, No, but we will flee upon horses,—therefore shall ye flee; and, We will ride upon the swift,—therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
\[17]One thousand [shall flee] at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as a banner on a hill.
\[18]And therefore will Jehovah wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he lift himself up, that he may have mercy upon you; for Jehovah is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.
\[19]For the people shall dwell in Zion, at Jerusalem. Thou shalt weep no more; he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; as he heareth it, he will answer thee.
\[20]And the Lord will give you the bread of adversity, and the water of oppression; yet thy teachers shall not be hidden any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers.
\[21]And when ye turn to the right hand or when ye turn to the left, thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it.
\[22]And ye shall defile the silver covering of your graven images, and the gold overlaying of your molten images; thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth: Out! shalt thou say unto it.
\[23]And he will give the rain of thy seed with which thou shalt sow the ground; and bread, the produce of the ground, and it shall be fat and rich. In that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures;
\[24]and the oxen and the asses that till the ground shall eat salted provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.
\[25]And there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every hill that is lifted up, brooks [and] water-courses, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
\[26]And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the wound of their stroke.
\[27]Behold, the name of Jehovah cometh from far, burning [with] his anger—a grievous conflagration; his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a consuming fire;
\[28]and his breath as an overflowing torrent, which reacheth even to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction, and [to put] a bridle into the jaws of the peoples, that causeth them to go astray.
\[29]Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a feast is sanctified; and joy of heart, as of one who goeth with a pipe to come unto the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.
\[30]And Jehovah will cause the majesty of his voice to be heard, and will shew the lighting down of his arm with indignation of anger, and a flame of consuming fire, with waterflood and storm and hailstones.
\[31]For through the voice of Jehovah shall the Assyrian be broken down: he will smite [him] with the rod.

nd it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
\[2]And the king of Assyria sent Rab-shakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem, to king Hezekiah, with a strong force. And he stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller's field.
\[3]Then came forth to him Eliakim the son of Hilkijah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the chronicler.
\[4]And Rab-shakeh said to them, Say now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: What confidence is this in which thou trustest?
\[5]Thou sayest, but it is a word of the lips, [There is] counsel and strength for war. Now on whom dost thou rely, that thou hast revolted against me?
\[6]Behold, thou reliest upon the staff of that broken reed, upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it goes into his hand, and pierces it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that rely upon him.
\[7]And if thou say to me, We rely upon Jehovah our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?
\[8]And now engage, I pray thee, with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
\[9]How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants? And thou reliest upon Egypt for chariots and for horsemen!
\[10]And now am I come up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.
\[11]And Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to Rab-shakeh, Speak, we pray thee, to thy servants in Syriac, for we understand it; and speak not to us in the Jewish [language] in the ears of the people that are upon the wall.
\[12]And Rab-shakeh said, Is it to thy master and to thee that my master sent me to speak these words? Is it not to the men that sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own urine with you?
\[13]And Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish [language], and said, Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!
\[14]Thus says the king: Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you.
\[15]Neither let Hezekiah make you rely upon Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will certainly deliver us; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[16]Hearken not to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: Make peace with me and come out to me; and eat every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink every one the waters of his own cistern;
\[17]until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
\[18]Let not Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\[19]Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
\[20]Who are they among all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
\[21]And they were silent, and answered him not a word; for the king's command was, saying, Answer him not.
\[22]And Eliakim the son of Hilkijah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the chronicler, came to Hezekiah, with their garments rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh.

\[2]And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz.
\[3]And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of reviling; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
\[4]It may be Jehovah thy God will hear the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God hath heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that is left.
\[5]And the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
\[6]And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith Jehovah: Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
\[7]Behold, I will put a spirit into him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
\[8]And Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.
\[9]And he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He has come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard [it], he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
\[10]Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Let not thy God, upon whom thou reliest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[11]Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all countries, destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
\[12]Have the gods of the nations which my fathers have destroyed delivered them, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Thelassar?
\[13]Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?
\[14]And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up into the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.
\[15]And Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah, saying,
\[16]Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, who sittest [between] the cherubim, thou, the Same, thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made the heavens and the earth.
\[17]Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open, Jehovah, thine eyes, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to reproach the living God.
\[18]Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the lands, and their countries,
\[19]and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; and they have destroyed them.
\[20]And now, Jehovah our God, save us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art Jehovah, thou only.
\[21]And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,
\[22]this is the word which Jehovah hath spoken against him: The virgin-daughter of Zion despiseth thee, laugheth thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem shaketh her head at thee.
\[23]Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted the voice? Against the Holy One of Israel hast thou lifted up thine eyes on high.
\[24]By thy servants thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the recesses of Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, the choice of its cypresses; and I will enter into its furthest height, [into] the forest of its fruitful field.
\[25]I have digged and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the streams of Matsor.
\[26]Hast thou not heard that long ago I did it, and that from ancient days I formed it? Now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest lay waste fortified cities [into] ruinous heaps.
\[27]And their inhabitants were powerless, they were dismayed and put to shame; they were [as] the grass of the field and the green herb, [as] the grass on the housetops, and grain blighted before it be grown up.
\[28]But I know thine abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.
\[29]Because thy raging against me and thine arrogance is come up into mine ears, I will put my ring in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will make thee go back by the way by which thou camest.
\[30]And this [shall be] the sign unto thee: there shall be eaten this year such as groweth of itself; and in the second year that which springeth of the same; but in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof.
\[31]And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward;
\[32]for out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that escape: the zeal of Jehovah of hosts shall do this.
\[33]Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.
\[34]By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith Jehovah.
\[35]And I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\[36]And an angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand. And when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead bodies.
\[37]And Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and abode at Nineveh.
\[38]And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

n those days Hezekiah was sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.
\[2]And Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Jehovah,
\[3]and said, Ah, Jehovah, remember, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept much.
\[4]And the word of Jehovah came to Isaiah, saying,
\[5]Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years.
\[6]And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.
\[7]And this [shall be] the sign to thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do this thing that he hath spoken:
\[8]behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees which hath gone down with the sun on the dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned on the dial ten degrees, by which it had gone down.
\[9]The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:
\[10]I said, In the meridian of my days I shall go to the gates of Sheol: I am deprived of the rest of my years.
\[11]I said, I shall not see Jah, Jah in the land of the living. With those who dwell where all has ceased to be, I shall behold man no more.
\[12]Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent. I have cut off like a weaver my life. He separateth me from the thrum:—from day to night thou wilt make an end of me.
\[13]I kept still until the morning; … as a lion, so doth he break all my bones. From day to night thou wilt make an end of me.
\[14]Like a swallow [or] a crane, so did I chatter; I mourned as a dove; mine eyes failed [with looking] upward: Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me.
\[15]What shall I say? He hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done [it]. I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
\[16]Lord, by these things [men] live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit; and thou hast recovered me, and made me to live.
\[17]Behold, instead of peace I had bitterness upon bitterness; but thou hast in love delivered my soul from the pit of destruction; for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
\[18]For not Sheol shall praise thee, nor death celebrate thee; they that go down into the pit do not hope for thy truth.
\[19]The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.
\[20]Jehovah was [purposed] to save me.—And we will play upon my stringed instruments all the days of our life, in the house of Jehovah.
\[21]Now Isaiah had said, Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover.

t that time Merodach-Baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent a letter and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that he had been sick and had recovered.
\[2]And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver and the gold, and the spices and the fine oil, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found amongst his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not shew them.
\[3]Then came the prophet Isaiah to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from whence came they to thee? And Hezekiah said, They came from a far country to me, from Babylon.
\[4]And he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah said, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewn them.
\[5]And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts:
\[6]Behold, days come when all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah.
\[7]And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.

\[26]Lift up your eyes on high, and see! Who hath created these things, bringing out their host by number? He calleth them all by name; through the greatness of his might and strength of power, not one faileth.

\[14]Long time have I holden my peace; I have been still, I have restrained myself: I will cry like a woman that travaileth; I will blow and pant at once.
\[15]I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.

\[3]For I [am] Jehovah thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.
\[4]Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee; and I will give men for thee, and peoples for thy life.
\[5]Fear not, for I [am] with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;
\[6]I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from afar, and my daughters from the end of the earth,
\[7]every one that is called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory: I have formed him, yea, I have made him.
\[8]Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.
\[9]Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples be assembled: who among them declareth this, or causeth us to hear former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say, [It is] truth.
\[10]Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I [am] HE: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.
\[11]I, I [am] Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour.
\[12]It is I that have declared, and have saved, and have shewed, when there was no strange [god] among you; and ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, that I [am] God.
\[13]Yea, since the day was, I [am] HE, and there is none that delivereth out of my hand: I will work, and who shall hinder it?
\[14]Thus saith Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought all of them down as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.
\[15]I [am] Jehovah, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.
\[16]Thus saith Jehovah, who maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters,
\[17]who bringeth forth chariot and horse, army and power—they lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinct, they are quenched as tow:
\[18]—Remember not the former things, neither consider the ancient things:
\[19]behold, I do a new thing; now it shall spring forth: shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, rivers in the waste.
\[20]The beast of the field shall glorify me, the jackals and the ostriches; for I will give waters in the wilderness, rivers in the waste, to give drink to my people, my chosen.
\[21]This people have I formed for myself: they shall shew forth my praise.
\[22]—But thou hast not called upon me, Jacob; for thou hast been weary of me, O Israel:
\[23]thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt-offerings, neither hast thou glorified me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to toil with an oblation, nor wearied thee with incense.
\[24]Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices; but thou hast made me to toil with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.
\[25]—I, I [am] He that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and I will not remember thy sins.
\[26]Put me in remembrance, let us plead together; rehearse thine own [cause], that thou mayest be justified.
\[27]Thy first father hath sinned, and thy mediators have rebelled against me.
\[28]And I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the ban, and Israel to reproaches.

\[2]thus saith Jehovah, that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, who helpeth thee, Fear not, Jacob, my servant, and thou, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
\[3]For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring.
\[4]And they shall spring up among the grass, as willows by the water-courses.
\[5]One shall say, I am Jehovah's; and another shall call [himself] by the name of Jacob; and another shall write with his hand: [I am] Jehovah's, and surname [himself] by the name of Israel.
\[6]Thus saith Jehovah, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts: I [am] the first, and I [am] the last, and beside me there is no God.
\[7]And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? And the coming things, and those that shall happen, let them declare unto them.
\[8]Fear not, neither be afraid. Have I not caused thee to hear from that time, and have declared it? and ye are my witnesses. Is there a +God beside me? yea, there is no Rock: I know not any.
\[9]They that form a graven image are all of them vanity, and their delectable things are of no profit; and they are their own witnesses: they see not, nor know;—that they may be ashamed.
\[10]Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?
\[11]Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed; and the workmen are but men. Let them all be gathered together, let them stand up: they shall fear, they shall be ashamed together.
\[12]The iron-smith [hath] a chisel, and he worketh in the coals, and he fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with his strong arm;—but he is hungry, and his strength faileth; he hath not drunk water, and he is faint.
\[13]The worker in wood stretcheth out a line; he marketh it out with red chalk; he formeth it with sharp tools, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of man: that it may remain in the house.
\[14]When he heweth him down cedars, he taketh also a holm-oak and a terebinth—he chooseth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth a pine, and the rain maketh [it] grow.
\[15]And it shall be for a man to burn, and he taketh thereof, and warmeth himself; he kindleth it also, and baketh bread; he maketh also a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.
\[16]He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh, he roasteth roast, and is satisfied; yea, he is warm, and saith, Aha, I am become warm, I have seen the fire.
\[17]And with the remainder thereof he maketh a god, his graven image; he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me, for thou art my god.
\[18]They have no knowledge, and understand not; for he hath plastered their eyes, that they may not see; and their hearts, that they may not understand.
\[19]And none taketh it to heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire, and have also baked bread upon the coals thereof, I have roasted flesh, and eaten [it], and with the rest thereof shall I make an abomination? shall I bow down to a block of wood?
\[20]He feedeth on ashes; a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?
\[21]Remember these things, O Jacob, and Israel, for thou art my servant; I have formed thee: thou art my servant, Israel; thou shalt not be forgotten of me.
\[22]I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.
\[23]Sing, ye heavens; for Jehovah hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth; break forth into singing, ye mountains, the forest, and every tree therein! For Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.
\[24]Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb: I [am] Jehovah, the maker of all things; who alone stretched out the heavens, who did spread forth the earth by myself;
\[25]—he that frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;
\[26]that confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built up, and I will raise up their ruins;
\[27]that saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers;
\[28]that saith of Cyrus, [He is] my shepherd, and he shall perform all my pleasure; even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.

hus saith Jehovah to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him—and I will loose the loins of kings; to open before him the two-leaved doors, and the gates shall not be shut:
\[2]I will go before thee, and make the elevated places plain; I will break in pieces the brazen doors, and cut asunder the bars of iron;
\[3]and I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places; that thou mayest know that I, Jehovah, who call thee by name, [am] the God of Israel.
\[4]For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have called thee by thy name; I surnamed thee, though thou didst not know me;
\[5]I [am] Jehovah, and there is none else; there is no God beside me: I girded thee, and thou hast not known me;
\[6]—that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the going down, that there is none beside me. I [am] Jehovah, and there is none else;
\[7]forming the light and creating darkness, making peace and creating evil: I, Jehovah, do all these things.
\[8]Drop down, [ye] heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness; let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and with it let righteousness spring up. I, Jehovah, have created it.
\[9]Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let a potsherd [strive] with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that formeth it, What makest thou? Or thy work, He hath no hands?
\[10]Woe unto him that saith unto [his] father, What begettest thou? Or to [his] mother, What hast thou brought forth?
\[11]Thus saith Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: Ask me of the things to come; concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me.
\[12]It is I that have made the earth, and created man upon it; it is I, my hands, that have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.
\[13]It is I that have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make all his ways straight: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith Jehovah of hosts.
\[14]Thus saith Jehovah: The wealth of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall walk after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall bow down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, [saying,] Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, no other God. …
\[15]Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour. …
\[16]They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them; they shall go away in confusion together, the makers of idols.
\[17]Israel shall be saved by Jehovah with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded, unto the ages of ages.
\[18]For thus saith Jehovah who created the heavens, God himself who formed the earth and made it, he who established it,—not as waste did he create it: he formed it to be inhabited:—I [am] Jehovah, and there is none else.
\[19]I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth; I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek me in vain: I [am] Jehovah, speaking righteousness, declaring things which are right.
\[20]Gather yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations. They have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.
\[21]Declare and bring [them] near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath caused this to be heard from ancient time? [who] hath declared it long ago? Is it not I, Jehovah? And there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour, there is none besides me.
\[22]Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I [am] God, and there is none else.
\[23]I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth [in] righteousness and shall not return, that unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.
\[24]Only in Jehovah, shall one say, have I righteousness and strength. To him shall [men] come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.
\[25]In Jehovah shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.

ear ye this, house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, who swear by the name of Jehovah, and make mention of the God of Israel, not in truth, nor in righteousness.
\[2]For they are named after the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel: Jehovah of hosts is his name.
\[3]I have declared the former things long ago; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I caused them to be heard: I wrought suddenly, and they came to pass.
\[4]Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass,
\[5]so I have long ago declared [them] to thee; before they came to pass I caused thee to hear [them]; lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, or my molten image hath commanded them.
\[6]Thou heardest, see all this;—and ye, will not ye declare [it]? I have caused thee to hear new things from this time, and things hidden, and that thou knewest not:
\[7]they are created now, and not long ago; and before this day thou hast not heard them, lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.
\[8]Yea, thou heardest not, yea, thou knewest not, yea, from of old thine ear was not opened; for I knew that thou wouldest ever deal treacherously, and thou wast called a transgressor from the womb.
\[9]For my name's sake I will defer mine anger, and [for] my praise will I refrain as to thee, that I cut thee not off.
\[10]Behold, I have refined thee, but not as silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.
\[11]For mine own sake, for mine own sake, will I do [it]; for how should [my name] be profaned? and I will not give my glory unto another.
\[12]Hearken unto me, Jacob, and [thou] Israel, my called. I [am] HE; I, the first, and I, the last.
\[13]Yea, my hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spread abroad the heavens: I call unto them, they stand up together.
\[14]All ye, gather yourselves together, and hear: which among them hath declared these things? He whom Jehovah hath loved shall execute his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm [shall be on] the Chaldeans.
\[15]I, [even] I, have spoken; yea, I have called him; I have brought him, and his way shall be prosperous.
\[16]Come near unto me, hear ye this: I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I; and now the Lord Jehovah hath sent me, and his Spirit.
\[17]Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I [am] Jehovah thy God, who teacheth thee for [thy] profit, who leadeth thee in the way that thou shouldest go.
\[18]Oh that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! Then would thy peace have been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea;
\[19]and thy seed would have been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof: their name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.
\[20]Go ye forth from Babylon, flee from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing; declare, cause this to be heard, utter it to the end of the earth; say ye, Jehovah hath redeemed his servant Jacob.
\[21]And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; yea, he clave the rock, and the waters gushed out.

\[2]And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword, he hath concealed me under the shadow of his hand, and he hath made me a polished shaft: in his quiver hath he hidden me.
\[3]And he said unto me, Thou art my servant, Israel, in whom I will glorify myself.
\[4]—And I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought and in vain; nevertheless my judgment is with Jehovah, and my work with my God.
\[5]And now, saith Jehovah, that formed me from the womb to be his servant, that I should bring Jacob again to him; (though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorified in the eyes of Jehovah, and my God shall be my strength;)
\[6]—and he saith, It is a small thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel; I have even given thee for a light of the nations, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.
\[7]Thus saith Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to the servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise, princes, and they shall worship, because of Jehovah who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who hath chosen thee.
\[8]Thus saith Jehovah: In a time of acceptance have I answered thee, and in the day of salvation have I helped thee; and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the land, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;
\[9]saying to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pasture shall be on all bare hills.
\[10]They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor sun smite them; for he that hath mercy on them will lead them, and by the springs of water will he guide them.
\[11]And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be raised up.
\[12]Behold, these shall come from afar; and behold, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.

\[15]Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Even these forget, but I will not forget thee.
\[16]Lo, I have graven thee upon the palms of [my] hands; thy walls are continually before me.
\[17]Thy sons shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that laid thee waste shall go forth from thee.
\[18]Lift up thine eyes round about and behold: they all gather themselves together, they come to thee. As I live, saith Jehovah, thou shalt indeed clothe thee with them all as with an ornament, and bind them on as a bride doth.
\[19]For [in] thy waste and thy desolate places, and thy destroyed land, thou shalt even now be too straitened by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.
\[20]The children of thy bereavement shall yet say in thine ears, The place is too narrow for me: make room for me, that I may dwell.
\[21]And thou shalt say in thy heart, Who hath borne me these, seeing I had lost my children and was desolate, an exile, and driven about? and who hath brought up these? behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?
\[22]Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and set up my banner to the peoples; and they shall bring thy sons in [their] bosom, and thy daughters shall be carried upon the shoulder.
\[23]And kings shall be thy nursing-fathers, and their princesses thy nursing-mothers: they shall bow down to thee with the face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet. And thou shalt know that I [am] Jehovah; for they shall not be ashamed who wait on me.
\[24]Shall the prey be taken from the mighty? and shall he that is rightfully captive be delivered?
\[25]For thus saith Jehovah: Even the captive of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; and I will strive with him that striveth with thee, and I will save thy children.
\[26]And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with new wine. And all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, [am] thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

\[15]And I am Jehovah thy God, who raiseth the sea, so that its waves roar: Jehovah of hosts is his name.

\[17]Arouse thyself, arouse thyself, stand up, Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of Jehovah the cup of his fury. Thou hast drunk, hast drained out the goblet-cup of bewilderment:
\[18]—there is none to guide her among all the children that she hath brought forth; neither is there any to take her by the hand of all the children that she hath brought up.
\[19]These two [things] are come unto thee; who will bemoan thee?—desolation and destruction, and famine and sword: how shall I comfort thee?
\[20]Thy children have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an oryx in a net: they are full of the fury of Jehovah, the rebuke of thy God.
\[21]Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:
\[22]thus saith thy Lord, Jehovah, and thy God, who pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I take out of thy hand the cup of bewilderment, the goblet-cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:
\[23]and I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; who have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over; and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street to them that went over.

\[2]Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, captive daughter of Zion.

\[14]As many were astonished at thee—his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the children of men

\[2]For he shall grow up before him as a tender sapling, and as a root out of dry ground: he hath no form nor lordliness, and when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
\[3]He is despised and left alone of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief, and like one from whom [men] hide their faces;—despised, and we esteemed him not.
\[4]Surely *he* hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; and we, we did regard him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
\[5]But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed.
\[6]All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned every one to his own way; and Jehovah hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all.
\[7]He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, but he opened not his mouth; he was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and was as a sheep dumb before her shearers, and he opened not his mouth.
\[8]He was taken from oppression and from judgment; and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgression of my people was he stricken.
\[9]And [men] appointed his grave with the wicked, but he was with the rich in his death, because he had done no violence, neither was there guile in his mouth.
\[10]Yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise him; he hath subjected [him] to suffering. When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see a seed, he shall prolong [his] days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand.
\[11]He shall see of [the fruit of] the travail of his soul, [and] shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant instruct many in righteousness; and *he* shall bear their iniquities.
\[12]Therefore will I assign him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong: because he hath poured out his soul unto death, and was reckoned with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

\[12]and I will make thy battlements of rubies, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of precious stones.
\[13]And all thy children [shall be] taught of Jehovah, and great shall be the peace of thy children.

ehold, Jehovah's hand is not shortened that it cannot save, neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear;
\[2]but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid [his] face from you, that he doth not hear.
\[3]For your hands are stained with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips speak lies, your tongue muttereth unrighteousness:
\[4]none calleth for justice, none pleadeth in truthfulness. They trust in vanity, and speak falsehood; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.
\[5]They hatch serpents' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.
\[6]Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works; their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.
\[7]Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths;
\[8]the way of peace they know not, and there is no judgment in their goings; they have made their paths crooked: whoso goeth therein knoweth not peace.
\[9]Therefore is justice far from us, and righteousness overtaketh us not: we wait for light, and behold darkness; for brightness, [but] we walk in obscurity.
\[10]We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at midday as in the twilight; amongst the flourishing we are as the dead.
\[11]We roar all like bears, and mourn grievously like doves: we look for judgment, and there is none; for salvation, [but] it is far from us.
\[12]For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us; and our iniquities, we know them:
\[13]in transgressing and lying against Jehovah, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
\[14]And judgment is turned away backward, and righteousness standeth afar off; for truth stumbleth in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.
\[15]And truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. And Jehovah saw [it], and it was evil in his sight that there was no judgment.
\[16]And he saw that there was no man, and he wondered that there was no intercessor; and his arm brought him salvation, and his righteousness, it sustained him.
\[17]And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on garments of vengeance [for] clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.
\[18]According to deeds, so will he repay: fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.
\[19]And they shall fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and from the rising of the sun, his glory. When the adversary shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of Jehovah will lift up a banner against him.
\[20]And the Redeemer will come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith Jehovah.
\[21]And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith Jehovah: My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith Jehovah, from henceforth and for ever.

\[3]I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the peoples not a man was with me; and I have trodden them in mine anger, and trampled them in my fury; and their blood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all mine apparel.
\[4]For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed had come.
\[5]And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: and mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.
\[6]And I have trodden down the peoples in mine anger, and made them drunk in my fury; and their blood have I brought down to the earth.
\[7]I will record the loving-kindnesses of Jehovah, the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah hath bestowed upon us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel which he hath bestowed upon them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses.
\[8]And he said, They are indeed my people, children that will not lie; and he became their Saviour.
\[9]In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them and carried them all the days of old.
\[10]But they rebelled and grieved his holy Spirit: and he turned to be their enemy; himself, he fought against them.
\[11]But he remembered the days of old, Moses [and] his people: Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? Where is he that put his holy Spirit within him,
\[12]his glorious arm leading them by the right hand of Moses, dividing the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name,
\[13]—who led them through the depths, like a horse in the wilderness, [and] they stumbled not?
\[14]As cattle go down into the valley, the Spirit of Jehovah gave them rest; so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.
\[15]Look down from the heavens, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory! Where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy tender mercies? Are they restrained toward me?
\[16]For thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, Jehovah, art our Father; our Redeemer, from everlasting, is thy name.
\[17]Why, O Jehovah, hast thou made us to err from thy ways, hast hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.
\[18]Thy holy people have possessed [it] but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.
\[19]We have become [like those] over whom thou never barest rule, those not called by thy name.

\[2]—as fire kindleth brushwood, as the fire causeth water to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations might tremble at thy presence!
\[3]When thou didst terrible things [which] we looked not for, thou camest down, and the mountains flowed down at thy presence.
\[4]Never have [men] heard, nor perceived by the ear, nor hath eye seen a God beside thee, who acteth for him that waiteth for him.

\[7]and there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee; for thou hast hidden thy face from us, and hast caused us to melt away through our iniquities.
\[8]And now, Jehovah, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.
\[9]Be not wroth very sore, O Jehovah, neither remember iniquity for ever. Behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.
\[10]Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
\[11]Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burnt up with fire, and all our precious things are laid waste.

 am sought out of them that inquired not [for me], I am found of them that sought me not; I have said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.
\[2]I have stretched out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, who walk in a way not good, after their own thoughts;
\[3]the people that provoke me to anger continually to my face, sacrificing in gardens and burning incense upon the bricks;
\[4]who sit down among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; who eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things [is in] their vessels;
\[5]who say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.
\[6]Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,
\[7]your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, who have burned incense upon the mountains, and outraged me upon the hills; and I will measure their former work into their bosom.
\[8]Thus saith Jehovah: As the new wine is found in the cluster, and it is said, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it; so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy [them] all.
\[9]And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah a possessor of my mountains; and mine elect shall possess it, and my servants shall dwell there.
\[10]And the Sharon shall be a fold for flocks, and the valley of Achor a couching-place of the herds, for my people that have sought me.
\[11]But ye who forsake Jehovah, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Gad, and fill up mixed wine unto Meni:
\[12]I will even assign you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down in the slaughter; because I called, and ye did not answer, I spoke, and ye did not hear; but ye did what was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delight not.
\[13]Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, my servants shall eat, and *ye* shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, and *ye* shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, and *ye* shall be ashamed;
\[14]behold, my servants shall sing aloud for gladness of heart, and *ye* shall cry out for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.
\[15]And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto mine elect; for the Lord Jehovah will slay thee, and will call his servants by another name:
\[16]so that he who blesseth himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the land shall swear by the God of truth: because the former troubles shall be forgotten, and because they shall be hidden from mine eyes.
\[17]For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
\[18]But be glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create. For behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
\[19]And I will rejoice over Jerusalem, and will joy in my people; and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
\[20]There shall be no more thenceforth an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not completed his days; for the youth shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.
\[21]And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof:
\[22]they shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
\[23]They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for terror; for they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.
\[24]And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
\[25]The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith Jehovah.

\[2]Even all these things hath my hand made, and all these things have been, saith Jehovah. But to this man will I look: to the afflicted and contrite in spirit, and who trembleth at my word.
\[3]He that slaughtereth an ox, smiteth a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, breaketh a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, [it is as] swine's blood; he that presenteth a memorial of incense, [is as] he that blesseth an idol. As they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations,
\[4]I also will choose their calamities, and will bring their fears upon them; because I called, and none answered, I spoke, and they did not hear, but did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delight not.
\[5]Hear the word of Jehovah, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let Jehovah be glorified, and let us see your joy! but they shall be ashamed.
\[6]A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Jehovah that rendereth recompence to his enemies!
\[7]Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child.
\[8]Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Can a land be made to bring forth in one day? shall a nation be born at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her sons.
\[9]Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith Jehovah; I who cause to bring forth, shall I shut [the womb]? saith thy God.
\[10]Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all ye that love her; rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn over her:
\[11]because ye shall suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; because ye shall drink out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.
\[12]For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing torrent; and ye shall suck, ye shall be carried upon the side, and be dandled upon the knees.
\[13]As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
\[14]And ye shall see [this], and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the grass; and the hand of Jehovah shall be known toward his servants, and he will have indignation toward his enemies.
\[15]For behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
\[16]For by fire and by his sword will Jehovah enter into judgment with all flesh: and the slain of Jehovah shall be many.
\[17]They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one in the midst; that eat swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall perish together, saith Jehovah.
\[18]And I,—their works and their thoughts [are before me]. … [The time] cometh for the gathering of all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.
\[19]And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow; to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory: and they shall declare my glory among the nations.
\[20]And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations as an oblation unto Jehovah, upon horses, and in chariots, and in covered waggons, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my holy mountain, to Jerusalem, saith Jehovah, as the children of Israel bring an oblation in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah.
\[21]And I will also take of them for priests [and] for Levites, saith Jehovah.
\[22]For as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make shall remain before me, saith Jehovah, so shall your seed and your name remain.
\[23]And it shall come to pass from new moon to new moon, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, saith Jehovah.
\[24]And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence unto all flesh.

he words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkijah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
\[2]to whom the word of Jehovah came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign;
\[3]it came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive, in the fifth month.
\[4]And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
\[5]Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I hallowed thee, I appointed thee a prophet unto the nations.
\[6]And I said, Alas, Lord Jehovah! behold, I cannot speak; for I am a child.
\[7]But Jehovah said unto me, Say not, I am a child; for thou shalt go to whomsoever I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.
\[8]Be not afraid of them; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith Jehovah.
\[9]And Jehovah put forth his hand and touched my mouth; and Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.
\[10]See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up, and to break down, and to destroy, and to overthrow, to build and to plant.
\[11]And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree.
\[12]And Jehovah said unto me, Thou hast well seen; for I am watchful over my word to perform it.
\[13]And the word of Jehovah came to me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething-pot, and its face is from the north.
\[14]And Jehovah said unto me, Out of the north shall evil break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
\[15]For behold, I am calling all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith Jehovah, and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah:
\[16]and I will pronounce my judgments against them for all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.
\[17]Thou, therefore, gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I shall command thee: be not dismayed at them, lest I cause thee to be dismayed before them.
\[18]And I, behold, I appoint thee this day as a strong city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land; against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.
\[19]And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to deliver thee.

nd the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[2]Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.
\[3]Israel was holiness unto Jehovah, the first-fruits of his increase: all that devour him are guilty; evil shall come upon them, saith Jehovah.
\[4]Hear the word of Jehovah, house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.
\[5]Thus saith Jehovah: What injustice have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and become vain?
\[6]And they said not, Where is Jehovah, that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us in the wilderness, in a land of deserts and of pits, in a land of drought and of the shadow of death, in a land that no one passeth through, and where no man dwelleth?
\[7]And I brought you into a fruitful land, to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof; and ye entered and defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.
\[8]The priests said not, Where is Jehovah? and they that handled the law knew me not; and the shepherds transgressed against me; and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after [things that] do not profit.
\[9]Therefore will I yet plead with you, saith Jehovah, and with your children's children will I plead.
\[10]For pass over to the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there have been such a thing.
\[11]Hath a nation changed [its] gods? and they are no gods;—but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.
\[12]Be astonished, ye heavens, at this, and shudder; be amazed very much, saith Jehovah.
\[13]For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, to hew them out cisterns, broken cisterns that hold no water.
\[14]Is Israel a bondman? Is he a home-born [slave]? Why is he become a spoil?
\[15]The young lions roared against him, they gave forth their voice, and they made his land desolate: his cities are burned, without inhabitant.
\[16]Even the children of Noph and Tahapanes have fed on the crown of thy head.
\[17]Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God, at the time he was leading thee in the way?
\[18]And now, what hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Shihor? And what hast thou to do with the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?
\[19]Thine own wickedness chastiseth thee, and thy backslidings reprove thee: know then and see that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.
\[20]For of old thou hast broken thy yoke, [and] burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not serve. For upon every high hill, and under every green tree, thou bowest down, playing the harlot.
\[21]And I,—I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed; how then art thou turned into the degenerate shoots of a strange vine unto me?
\[22]For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much potash, thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[23]How sayest thou, I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baals? See thy way in the valley, acknowledge what thou hast done—a swift dromedary traversing her ways!
\[24]—a wild ass, used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind in her desire! In her ardour, who shall turn her away? All they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.
\[25]Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst. But thou saidst, There is no hope; no, for I love strangers, and after them will I go.
\[26]As a thief is ashamed when he is found, so shall the house of Israel be ashamed—they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets—
\[27]saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth; for they have turned the back unto me, and not the face; and in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us!
\[28]Where then are thy gods that thou hast made for thyself? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for as the number of thy cities, are thy gods, O Judah.
\[29]Wherefore would ye contend with me? Ye all have transgressed against me, saith Jehovah.
\[30]In vain have I smitten your children: they received no correction. Your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
\[31]O generation, mark ye the word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel, or a land of thick darkness? Wherefore say my people, We have dominion; we will come no more unto thee?
\[32]Doth a virgin forget her ornaments, a bride her attire? But my people have forgotten me days without number.
\[33]How dost thou trim thy way to seek love! Therefore hast thou also accustomed thy ways to wickedness.
\[34]Yea, in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor, whom thou didst not encounter breaking in, but [it is found] upon all these.
\[35]And thou sayest, Indeed I am innocent; his anger will turn from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee because thou sayest, I have not sinned.
\[36]Why dost thou gad about so much, and change thy way? Thou shalt also be brought to shame by Egypt, as thou wast brought to shame by Assyria.
\[37]Thou shalt indeed go forth from her with thy hands upon thy head; for Jehovah hath rejected those thou confidest in, and thou shalt not prosper by them.

hey say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? Would not that land be utterly polluted? But thou hast committed fornication with many lovers; yet return to me, saith Jehovah.
\[2]Lift up thine eyes unto the heights and see, where hast thou not been lain with? In the ways hast thou sat for them, as an Arab in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy fornications and with thy wickedness.
\[3]And the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; but thou hast a harlot's forehead, thou refusest to be ashamed.
\[4]Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the guide of my youth?
\[5]Will he keep [his anger] for ever? Will he preserve it perpetually? Behold, thou hast spoken and hast done evil things, and thou art [so] determined.
\[6]And Jehovah said unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen what backsliding Israel hath done? She hath gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath committed fornication.
\[7]And I said, After she hath done all these [things], she will return unto me; but she returned not. And her sister Judah, the treacherous, saw [it].
\[8]And I saw that when for all the causes wherein backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce, yet the treacherous Judah, her sister, feared not, but went and committed fornication also.
\[9]And it came to pass through the lightness of her fornication that she polluted the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.
\[10]And even for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart, but with falsehood, saith Jehovah.
\[11]And Jehovah said unto me, Backsliding Israel hath shewn herself more just than treacherous Judah.
\[12]Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith Jehovah: I will not make my face dark upon you; for I am merciful, saith Jehovah; I will not keep [anger] for ever.
\[13]Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against Jehovah thy God, and hast turned thy ways hither and thither to the strangers under every green tree; and ye have not hearkened to my voice, saith Jehovah.
\[14]Return, backsliding children, saith Jehovah; for I am a husband unto you, and I will take you, one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion.
\[15]And I will give you shepherds according to my heart, and they shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
\[16]And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied in the land and become fruitful, in those days, saith Jehovah, they shall say no more, Ark of the covenant of Jehovah! neither shall it come to mind, nor shall they remember it, nor shall they visit [it]; neither shall it be done any more.
\[17]At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem; and they shall no more walk after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
\[18]In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel; and they shall come together out of the land of the north, to the land which I caused your fathers to inherit.
\[19]And as for me, I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee the pleasant land, the goodly inheritance of the hosts of the nations? And I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from following me.
\[20]Surely [as] a woman treacherously departeth from her companion, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah.
\[21]A voice is heard upon the heights, the weeping supplications of the children of Israel; for they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Jehovah their God.
\[22]—Return, backsliding children; I will heal your backslidings. … Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art Jehovah our God.
\[23]Truly in vain [is salvation looked for] from the hills, [and] the multitude of mountains; truly in Jehovah our God is the salvation of Israel.
\[24]But shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
\[25]We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us; for we have sinned against Jehovah our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah our God.

f thou wilt return, O Israel, saith Jehovah, return unto me; and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not be a wanderer;
\[2]—and thou shalt in truth, in justice, and in righteousness swear, [As] Jehovah liveth! and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.

\[4]Circumcise yourselves for Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my fury come forth like fire and burn, and there be none to quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
\[5]Declare ye in Judah, and cause it to be heard in Jerusalem, and say, … and blow the trumpet in the land, cry aloud and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fenced cities.
\[6]Set up a banner toward Zion; take to flight, stay not! For I am bringing evil from the north, and a great destruction.
\[7]The lion is come up from his thicket, the destroyer of the nations is on his way; he is gone forth from his place, to make thy land desolate; thy cities shall be laid waste, without inhabitant.
\[8]For this, gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl! for the fierce anger of Jehovah is not turned away from us.
\[9]And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall be amazed.
\[10]And I said, Alas, Lord Jehovah! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.
\[11]At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind [cometh] from the heights in the wilderness, on the way of the daughter of my people, not for fanning, nor for cleansing.
\[12]A wind more vehement than that shall come from me: now will I also pronounce judgments against them.
\[13]Behold, he cometh up as clouds, and his chariots are as a whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are destroyed.
\[14]Wash thy heart, Jerusalem, from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?
\[15]For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.
\[16]Inform the nations; behold, make Jerusalem to hear: Besiegers come from a far country, and raise their voice against the cities of Judah.
\[17]As keepers of a field are they against her round about; for she hath been rebellious against me, saith Jehovah.
\[18]Thy way and thy doings have procured these [things] unto thee; this is thy wickedness, yea, it is bitter, yea, it reacheth unto thy heart.
\[19]My bowels! my bowels! I am in travail! [Oh,] the walls of my heart! My heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace: for thou hearest, my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the clamour of war.
\[20]Destruction upon destruction is proclaimed; for the whole land is wasted: suddenly are my tents laid waste, my curtains, in a moment.
\[21]How long shall I see the standard, [and] hear the sound of the trumpet?
\[22]For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have no intelligence; they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
\[23]I beheld the earth, and lo, it was waste and empty; and the heavens, and they had no light.
\[24]I beheld the mountains, and lo, they trembled, and all the hills shook violently.
\[25]I beheld, and lo, man was not, and all the fowl of the heavens were fled.
\[26]I beheld, and lo, the fruitful land was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down, before Jehovah, before his fierce anger.
\[27]For thus saith Jehovah: The whole land shall be a desolation; but I will not make a full end.
\[28]For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back therefrom.
\[29]At the noise of the horsemen and bowmen, every city fleeth; they go into the thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city is forsaken and no man dwelleth therein.
\[30]—And thou, wasted one, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rendest thine eyes with paint, in vain dost thou make thyself fair: [thy] lovers despise thee, they seek thy life.

un ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broadways thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be [any] that doeth justice, that seeketh fidelity; and I will pardon it.
\[2]And if they say, [As] Jehovah liveth! surely they swear falsely.
\[3]Jehovah, are not thine eyes upon fidelity? Thou hast smitten them, but they are not sore; thou hast consumed them, they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.
\[4]And I said, Surely these are the wretched ones, they are foolish; for they know not the way of Jehovah, the judgment of their God.
\[5]I will go unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they know the way of Jehovah, the judgment of their God; but these have altogether broken the yoke, have burst the bonds.
\[6]Therefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, a wolf of the evenings shall waste them; the leopard lurketh against their cities, every one that goeth out thence is torn in pieces: for their transgressions are multiplied, their backslidings are increased.
\[7]Wherefore should I pardon thee? Thy children have forsaken me, and swear by them that are not God. I have satiated them, and they have committed adultery, and they troop to the harlots' house.
\[8][As] well fed horses, they roam about, every one neigheth after his neighbour's wife.
\[9]Shall I not visit for these things? saith Jehovah, and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\[10]Go up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end; take away her battlements, for they are not Jehovah's.
\[11]For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith Jehovah.
\[12]They have denied Jehovah, and say, He is not; and evil shall not come upon us, nor shall we see sword nor famine;
\[13]and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.
\[14]Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts: Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
\[15]Behold, I bring a nation upon you from afar, house of Israel, saith Jehovah: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest thou what they say.
\[16]Their quiver is as an open sepulchre; they are all mighty men.
\[17]And they shall eat up thy harvest and thy bread, they shall eat up thy sons and thy daughters, they shall eat up thy flocks and thy herds, they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig-trees; they shall destroy with the sword thy strong cities, wherein thou trustedst.
\[18]Nevertheless in those days, saith Jehovah, I will not make a full end with you.
\[19]And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore hath Jehovah our God done all these things unto us? then shalt thou say to them, As ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.
\[20]Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,
\[21]Hear now this, O foolish and heartless people, who have eyes and see not; who have ears, and hear not.
\[22]Will ye not fear me? saith Jehovah. Will ye not tremble at my presence, who have set the sand a bound for the sea by a perpetual decree, and it shall not pass it? and its waves toss themselves, but they do not prevail; and they roar, yet can they not pass over it?
\[23]But this people hath a stubborn and a rebellious heart; they have turned aside and are gone.
\[24]And they say not in their heart, Let us now fear Jehovah our God, that giveth rain, both the early and the latter, in its season; who preserveth unto us the appointed weeks of harvest.
\[25]Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden from you what is good.
\[26]For among my people are found wicked [men]: they lay wait, as fowlers stoop down; they set a trap, they catch men.
\[27]As a cage full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and have enriched themselves.
\[28]They are become fat, they shine, yea, they surpass in deeds of wickedness; they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, and they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not adjudge.
\[29]Shall I not visit for these things? saith Jehovah; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\[30]An appalling and horrible thing is committed in the land:
\[31]the prophets prophesy falsehood, and the priests rule by their means; and my people love [to have it] so. But what will ye do in the end thereof?

lee for safety, ye children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a signal in Beth-haccerem; for evil appeareth out of the north, and a great destruction.
\[2]The comely and delicate one do I cut off, the daughter of Zion.
\[3]Shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch [their] tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.
\[4]Prepare war against her. Arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day hath declined, for the shadows of the evening are lengthening.
\[5]Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
\[6]For thus hath Jehovah of hosts said: Hew ye down trees, and cast a mound against Jerusalem. She is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.
\[7]As a well poureth forth her waters, so she poureth forth her wickedness: violence and destruction are heard in her; before me continually are grief and wounds.
\[8]Be thou instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from thee; lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.
\[9]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: They shall thoroughly glean like a vine the remnant of Israel: turn back thy hand, as a grape-gatherer unto the baskets.
\[10]To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of Jehovah is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.
\[11]And I am full of the fury of Jehovah, I am weary with holding in. Pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken; the aged with him [that is] full of days.
\[12]And their houses shall be turned unto others, [their] fields and wives together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah.
\[13]For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them, every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest, every one dealeth falsely.
\[14]And they have healed the breach of the daughter of my people lightly, saying, Peace, peace! when there is no peace.
\[15]Are they ashamed that they have committed abomination? Nay, they are not at all ashamed, neither know they what it is to blush. Therefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the time that I visit them they shall stumble, saith Jehovah.
\[16]Thus saith Jehovah: Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the ancient paths, which is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk [therein].
\[17]Also I have set watchmen over you:—Hearken ye to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.
\[18]Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O assembly, what is among them.
\[19]Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, the fruit of their thoughts; for they have not hearkened unto my words, and as to my law, they have rejected it.
\[20]To what purpose should there come to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? Your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor are your sacrifices pleasing unto me.
\[21]Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall over them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.
\[22]Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation is stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.
\[23]They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as a man for the battle, against thee, daughter of Zion.
\[24]We have heard the report thereof: our hands are grown feeble; anguish hath taken hold of us, pain as of a woman that travaileth.
\[25]Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for [there is] the sword of the enemy, terror is on every side.
\[26]Daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and roll thyself in ashes: make mourning, [as] for an only son—bitter lamentation; for the spoiler cometh suddenly upon us.
\[27]I have set thee among my people as an assayer, a fortress, that thou mayest know and try their way.
\[28]They are all the most rebellious of rebels, going about with slander: they are bronze and iron; they are all corrupters.
\[29]The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed by the fire; they have melted, and melted in vain; and the bad are not plucked away.

\[2]Stand in the gate of Jehovah's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship Jehovah.
\[3]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
\[4]Confide ye not in words of falsehood, saying, Jehovah's temple, Jehovah's temple, Jehovah's temple is this.
\[5]But if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, if ye really do justice between a man and his neighbour,
\[6][if] ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed no innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt;
\[7]then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers from of old even for ever.
\[8]Behold, ye confide in words of falsehood that cannot profit.
\[9]What? steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not …
\[10]then ye come and stand before me, in this house which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered,—in order to do all these abominations!
\[11]Is this house, which is called by my name, a den of robbers in your eyes? Even I, behold, I have seen it, saith Jehovah.
\[12]For go now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it, for the wickedness of my people Israel.
\[13]And now, because ye have done all these works, saith Jehovah, and I spoke unto you, rising up early and speaking, and ye heard not, and I called you, and ye answered not;
\[14]I will even do unto the house which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh;
\[15]and I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, all the seed of Ephraim.
\[16]And thou, pray not for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, and make not intercession to me; for I will not hear thee.
\[17]Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\[18]The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.
\[19]Is it I whom they provoke to anger? saith Jehovah; is it not themselves, to the shame of their own face?
\[20]Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place; upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
\[21]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt-offerings to your sacrifices, and eat the flesh.
\[22]For I spoke not unto your fathers, nor commanded them concerning burnt-offerings and sacrifices, in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt;
\[23]but I commanded them this thing, saying, Hearken unto my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and walk in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.
\[24]But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels, in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward and not forward.
\[25]Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt, unto this day, have I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them;
\[26]but they have not hearkened unto me, nor inclined their ear; and they have hardened their neck: they have done worse than their fathers.
\[27]And thou shalt speak all these words unto them, but they will not hearken unto thee; and thou shalt call unto them, but they will not answer thee.
\[28]And thou shalt say unto them, This is the nation which hath not hearkened unto the voice of Jehovah their God, nor received correction; fidelity is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
\[29]Cut off thy hair, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the heights; for Jehovah hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.
\[30]For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith Jehovah; they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.
\[31]And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded not, neither did it come up into my mind.
\[32]Therefore, behold, days are coming, saith Jehovah, when it shall no more be said, Topheth, and Valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter; for they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place.
\[33]And the carcases of this people shall be food for the fowl of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall scare [them] away.
\[34]And I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land shall become a waste.

\[3]And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, in all the places whither I have driven those that remain, saith Jehovah of hosts.
\[4]And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah: Do [men] fall, and not rise up? Doth one turn away, and not return?
\[5]Why hath this people of Jerusalem slidden back with a perpetual backsliding? They hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.
\[6]I hearkened and heard: they speak not what is right; there is no man who repenteth him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? Every one turneth to his course, like a horse rushing into the battle.
\[7]Even a stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times, and the turtle-dove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of Jehovah.
\[8]How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of Jehovah is with us? Behold, certainly the lying pen of the scribes hath made it falsehood.
\[9]The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: behold, they have rejected Jehovah's word; and what wisdom is in them?
\[10]Therefore will I give their wives unto others, their fields to those that shall possess [them]; for every one, from the least even unto the greatest, is given to covetousness; from the prophet even unto the priest, every one dealeth falsely.
\[11]And they have healed the breach of the daughter of my people lightly, saying, Peace, peace! when there is no peace.
\[12]Are they ashamed that they have committed abomination? Nay, they are not at all ashamed, and they know not how to blush. Therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall stumble, saith Jehovah.
\[13]I will utterly take them away, saith Jehovah: there are no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig-tree; and the leaf is faded: and I will give them up to those that shall pass over them.
\[14]Why do we sit still? Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fenced cities, and let us be silent there: for Jehovah our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against Jehovah.
\[15]Peace is looked for, and there is no good; a time of healing, and behold, terror.
\[16]The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan: the whole land trembleth at the sound of the neighing of his steeds, and they come, and devour the land, and all it contains, the city and those that dwell therein.
\[17]For behold, I send among you serpents, vipers against which there is no charm, and they shall bite you, saith Jehovah.
\[18]My comfort in my sadness! my heart is faint in me!
\[19]Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people, from a very far country: Is not Jehovah in Zion? Is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, with foreign vanities?
\[20]The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
\[21]—For the breach of the daughter of my people am I crushed; I go mourning; astonishment hath taken hold of me.

\[2]Oh that I had in the wilderness a traveller's lodging-place, that I might leave my people, and go away from them! For they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.
\[3]And they bend their tongue, their bow of falsehood, and not for fidelity are they valiant in the land; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith Jehovah.
\[4]Take ye heed every one of his friend, and confide not in any brother; for every brother only supplanteth, and every friend goeth about with slander.
\[5]And they act deceitfully every one with his neighbour, and speak not the truth: they teach their tongue to speak falsehood, they weary themselves with perverse dealing.
\[6]Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith Jehovah.
\[7]Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how else could I do for the daughter of my people?
\[8]Their tongue is a murderous arrow; it speaketh deceit. [A man] speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in his heart he layeth his ambush.
\[9]Shall I not visit them for these [things]? saith Jehovah; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\[10]For the mountains will I take up weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness, a lamentation; for they are burnt up, so that none passeth through them; and the voice of the cattle is not heard. Both the fowl of the heavens and the beasts are fled; they are gone.
\[11]And I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling-place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.
\[12]Who is a wise man, that he may understand this? and he to whom the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land perished, burnt up like a wilderness, so that none passeth through?
\[13]And Jehovah saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not hearkened unto my voice, nor walked in it,
\[14]but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baals, as their fathers taught them;
\[15]therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed this people with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink,
\[16]and will scatter them among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them.
\[17]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider, and call for the mourning women, that they may come, and send for the skilful women, that they may come;
\[18]and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids pour forth waters.
\[19]For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled, sorely put to shame! For we have forsaken the land, for they have cast down our dwellings.
\[20]Hear then the word of Jehovah, ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and each one her companion lamentation.
\[21]For death is come up through our windows, is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from the street, the young men from the broadways.
\[22]Speak, Thus saith Jehovah: Yea, the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the reaper, and there shall be none to gather.
\[23]Thus saith Jehovah: Let not the wise glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty glory in his might; let not the rich glory in his riches:
\[24]but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I [am] Jehovah, who exercise loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth; for in these things I delight, saith Jehovah.

\[26]Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners [of their beard] cut off, that dwell in the wilderness: for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.

\[2]Thus saith Jehovah: Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of the heavens; for the nations are dismayed at them.
\[3]For the statutes of the peoples are vanity; for [it is] a tree cut out of the forest, worked with a chisel by the hands of the artizan;
\[4]they deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.
\[5]They are as a palm-column of turned work, and they speak not; they are carried, for they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.
\[6]There is none like unto thee, Jehovah; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.
\[7]Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? For to thee doth it appertain; for among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.
\[8]But they are one and all senseless and foolish; the teaching of vanities is a stock.
\[9]Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artizan and of the hands of the founder; blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of skilful [men].
\[10]But Jehovah Elohim is truth; he is the living God, and the King of eternity. At his wrath the earth trembleth, and the nations cannot abide his indignation.
\[11]Thus shall ye say unto them: The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.
\[12]He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his understanding.
\[13]When he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the end of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.
\[14]Every man is become brutish, bereft of knowledge; every founder is put to shame by the graven image, for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
\[15]They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\[16]The portion of Jacob is not like them; for it is he that hath formed all [things], and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name.
\[17]Gather up thy baggage out of the land, O inhabitress of the fortress.
\[18]For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will this time sling out the inhabitants of the land, and will distress them, that they may be found.
\[19]Woe is me, for my wound! My stroke is hard to heal, and I had said, Yea, this is [my] grief, and I will bear it.
\[20]My tent is despoiled, and all my cords are broken; my children are gone forth from me, and they are not; there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
\[21]For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not sought Jehovah; therefore have they not acted wisely, and all their flock is scattered.
\[22]The voice of a rumour! Behold, it cometh, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.
\[23]I know, Jehovah, that the way of man is not his own; it is not in a man that walketh to direct his steps.
\[24]Jehovah, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.
\[25]Pour out thy fury upon the nations that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name; for they have eaten up Jacob, yea, they have eaten him up and consumed him, and have laid waste his dwelling-place.

\[3]And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant
\[4]which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Hearken unto my voice and do them, according to all that I command you; so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:
\[5]that I may perform the oath that I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. And I answered and said, Amen, Jehovah!
\[6]And Jehovah said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.
\[7]For I earnestly protested unto your fathers, in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Hearken unto my voice.
\[8]But they have not hearkened, nor inclined their ear, but have walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart; and I have brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded [them] to do, and they have not done.
\[9]And Jehovah said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[10]They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.
\[11]Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will bring evil upon them, from which they shall not be able to escape; and they will cry unto me, and I will not hearken unto them.
\[12]Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they have burned incense; but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
\[13]For [as] the number of thy cities, are thy gods, O Judah; and [as] the number of the streets of Jerusalem, have ye set up altars to the Shame, altars to burn incense unto Baal.
\[14]And thou, pray not for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.
\[15]What hath my beloved to do in my house, seeing that the more part practise their evil devices, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? When thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.
\[16]Jehovah had called thy name, A green olive-tree, fair, of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and its branches are broken.
\[17]For Jehovah of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done for themselves, to provoke me to anger in burning incense unto Baal.
\[18]And Jehovah hath given me knowledge, and I know [it]; then thou shewedst me their doings.
\[19]And I was like a tame lamb [that] is led to the slaughter; and I knew not that they devised devices against me, [saying,] Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.
\[20]But thou, Jehovah of hosts, who judgest righteously, who triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.
\[21]Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of Jehovah, that thou die not by our hand,
\[22]—therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;
\[23]and there shall be no remnant of them; for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, in the year of their visitation.

\[2]Thou hast planted them, they also have taken root: they advance, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, but far from their reins.
\[3]But thou, Jehovah, knowest me; thou hast seen me, and proved my heart toward thee. Drag them out like sheep for the slaughter, and set them apart for the day of slaughter.
\[4]How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of all the fields wither? Because of the wickedness of them that dwell therein, the beasts and the birds perish; for they say, He will not see our end.
\[5]If thou hast run with footmen, and they have wearied thee, how wilt thou then contend with horses? And if in a land of peace thou thinkest thyself in security, how wilt thou then do in the swelling of the Jordan?
\[6]For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee, even they have cried aloud after thee. Believe them not, though they speak good [words] unto thee.
\[7]I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage, I have given the beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
\[8]My heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest; it hath raised its voice against me: therefore have I hated it.
\[9]My heritage is unto me [as] a speckled bird of prey; the birds of prey round about are against her. Go, assemble all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour.
\[10]Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness:
\[11]they have made it a desolation; desolate, it mourneth unto me: the whole land is made desolate, for no man layeth it to heart.
\[12]Spoilers are come upon all heights in the wilderness; for the sword of Jehovah devoureth from one end of the land even to the [other] end of the land: no flesh hath peace.
\[13]They have sown wheat, and they reap thorns; they have put themselves to pain, [and] do not profit. Be ye therefore ashamed of your revenues, because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.
\[14]Thus saith Jehovah against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: Behold, I will pluck them up out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.
\[15]And it shall come to pass, after I have plucked them up, I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them back, each one to his inheritance, and each one to his land.
\[16]And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, [As] Jehovah liveth—even as they taught my people to swear by Baal—they shall be built up in the midst of my people.
\[17]And if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith Jehovah.

hus said Jehovah unto me: Go and buy thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins; but dip it not in water.
\[2]And I bought a girdle according to the word of Jehovah, and put it upon my loins.
\[3]And the word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying,
\[4]Take the girdle that thou hast bought, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.
\[5]So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as Jehovah had commanded me.
\[6]And it came to pass at the end of many days, that Jehovah said unto me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence which I commanded thee to hide there.
\[7]And I went to the Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it; and behold, the girdle was spoiled, it was good for nothing.
\[8]And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
\[9]Thus saith Jehovah: After this manner will I spoil the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
\[10]This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and go after other gods, to serve them and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle which is good for nothing.
\[11]For as a girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith Jehovah; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.
\[12]And thou shalt speak unto them this word: Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Every skin shall be filled with wine. And they will say unto thee, Do we not very well know that every skin shall be filled with wine?
\[13]And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, and the kings that sit for David upon his throne, and the priests and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
\[14]And I will dash them one against another, both the fathers and the sons together, saith Jehovah; I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy so as not to destroy them.
\[15]Hear ye, and give ear, be not lifted up; for Jehovah hath spoken.
\[16]Give glory to Jehovah your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the mountains of twilight; and ye shall look for light, but he will turn it into the shadow of death, and make [it] gross darkness.
\[17]And if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for [your] pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because Jehovah's flock is gone into captivity.
\[18]Say unto the king and to the queen: Humble yourselves, sit down low; for from your heads shall come down the crown of your magnificence.
\[19]The cities of the south are shut up, and there is none to open [them]; all Judah is carried away captive: it is wholly carried away captive.
\[20]Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north. Where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?
\[21]What wilt thou say when he shall visit thee, since thou thyself hast trained them to be princes in chief over thee? Shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?
\[22]And if thou say in thy heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts uncovered, [and] thy heels have suffered violence.
\[23]Can an Ethiopian change his skin, or a leopard his spots? [Then] may ye also do good, who are accustomed to do evil.
\[24]And I will scatter them as stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness.
\[25]This shall be thy lot, thy measured portion from me, saith Jehovah; because thou hast forgotten me, and confided in falsehood.
\[26]Therefore will I also turn thy skirts over thy face, and thy shame shall be seen.
\[27]Thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy fornication, on the hills, in the fields,—thine abominations, have I seen. Woe unto thee, Jerusalem! Wilt thou not be made clean? after how long a time yet?

he word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.
\[2]Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish, they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem goeth up.
\[3]And their nobles send their little ones for water: they come to the pits, they find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are ashamed, they are confounded, and have covered their heads.
\[4]Because the ground is chapt, for there hath been no rain on the earth, the ploughmen are ashamed, they cover their heads.
\[5]For the hind also calveth in the field, and forsaketh [its young], because there is no grass.
\[6]And the wild asses stand on the heights, they snuff up the wind like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage.
\[7]Jehovah, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou act for thy name's sake; for our backslidings are many—we have sinned against thee.
\[8]Thou hope of Israel, its Saviour in the time of trouble, why wilt thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a traveller that turneth aside to stay a night?
\[9]Why wilt thou be as a man astonished, as a mighty man that cannot save? Yet thou, Jehovah, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name: leave us not.
\[10]Thus saith Jehovah to this people: Even so have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet; and Jehovah hath no delight in them: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.
\[11]And Jehovah said unto me, Pray not for this people for their good.
\[12]When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer up burnt-offering and oblation, I will not accept them: for I will consume them by sword, and by famine, and by pestilence.
\[13]And I said, Alas, Lord Jehovah! Behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; for I will give you assured peace in this place.
\[14]And Jehovah said unto me, The prophets prophesy falsehood in my name; I have not sent them, neither have I commanded them, nor spoken unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision, and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.
\[15]Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, and who say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and by famine shall those prophets be consumed;
\[16]and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, because of the famine and the sword; and there shall be none to bury them, them, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters; and I will pour their wickedness upon them.
\[17]And thou shalt say this word unto them: Let mine eyes run down with tears, night and day, and not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.
\[18]If I go forth into the field, behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, behold them that pine away with famine! For both prophet and priest shall go about into a land that they know not.
\[19]—Hast thou then utterly rejected Judah? Doth thy soul loathe Zion? Why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? Peace is looked for, and there is no good,—and a time of healing, and behold terror!
\[20]Jehovah, we acknowledge our wickedness, the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against thee.
\[21]For thy name's sake, do not spurn [us], do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.
\[22]Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? Art not thou HE, Jehovah, our God? And we wait upon thee; for thou hast made all these things.

\[2]And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith Jehovah: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity.
\[3]For I will visit them with four kinds [of punishments], saith Jehovah: the sword to slay, and dogs to tear, and the fowl of the heavens, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy.
\[4]And I will give them over to be driven hither and thither amongst all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.
\[5]For who shall have pity upon thee, Jerusalem? and who shall bemoan thee? and who shall turn aside to ask after thy welfare?
\[6]Thou hast cast me off, saith Jehovah, thou art gone backward; and I have stretched out my hand against thee, and will destroy thee: I am become weary of repenting.
\[7]And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave of children [and] destroy my people: they have not returned from their ways.
\[8]Their widows are increased to me more than the sand of the seas; I have brought upon them, against the mother of the young men, a spoiler at noonday; I have caused anguish and terror to fall upon her suddenly.
\[9]She that hath borne seven languisheth, she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it is yet day; she is put to shame and confounded. And the residue of them will I give up to the sword before their enemies, saith Jehovah.
\[10]Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole land! I have not lent on usury, nor have they lent to me on usury; [yet] every one of them doth curse me.
\[11]Jehovah said, Verily I will set thee free for [thy] good; verily I will cause the enemy to meet thee kindly in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
\[12]Will iron break? iron from the north? and bronze?
\[13]Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, and in all thy borders;
\[14]and I will make [them] to pass with thine enemies into a land that thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger; it shall burn upon you.
\[15]Jehovah, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors; in thy long-suffering take me not away: know that for thy sake I bear reproach.
\[16]Thy words were found, and I did eat them, and thy words were unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart; for I am called by thy name, O Jehovah, God of hosts.
\[17]I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor exulted: I sat alone because of thy hand; for thou hast filled me with indignation.
\[18]Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable? It refuseth to be healed. Wilt thou be altogether unto me as a treacherous [spring], [as] waters that fail?
\[19]Therefore thus saith Jehovah: If thou return, then will I bring thee again, thou shalt stand before me; and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth. Let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.
\[20]And I will make thee unto this people a strong brazen wall; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee, to save thee and to deliver thee, saith Jehovah;

\[4]They shall die of painful deaths; they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried; they shall be as dung upon the face of the ground, and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine, and their carcases shall be food for the fowl of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth.
\[5]For thus saith Jehovah: Enter not into the house of wailing, neither go to lament or bemoan them; for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith Jehovah, the loving-kindness and the tender mercies.
\[6]Both great and small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried; and none shall lament for them, or cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them.
\[7]Nor shall they break [bread] for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall they give them the cup of consolations to drink for their father or for their mother.
\[8]And thou shalt not go into the house of feasting, to sit with them, to eat and to drink.
\[9]For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place, before your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
\[10]And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt declare unto this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath Jehovah pronounced all this great evil against us? and what is our iniquity? and what is our sin which we have committed against Jehovah our God?
\[11]then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith Jehovah, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;
\[12]and you, ye have done still worse than your fathers; and there ye are walking every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, not to hearken unto me:
\[13]and I will cast you forth out of this land, into a land that ye know not, ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night: because I will shew you no favour.
\[14]Therefore, behold, days are coming, saith Jehovah, that it shall no more be said, [As] Jehovah liveth, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
\[15]but, [As] Jehovah liveth, who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them. For I will bring them again into their land, which I gave unto their fathers.
\[16]Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith Jehovah, and they shall fish them; and afterwards will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them, from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.
\[17]For mine eyes are upon all their ways; they are not concealed from my face, neither is their iniquity hidden from before mine eyes.
\[18]But first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have profaned my land with the carcases of their detestable things, and with their abominations have they filled mine inheritance.
\[19]Jehovah, my strength and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of distress, unto thee shall the nations come from the ends of the earth, and they shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited falsehood [and] vanity; and in these things there is no profit.
\[20]Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no-gods?

\[15]Behold, these say unto me, Where is the word of Jehovah? let it then come!
\[16]But as for me, I have not hastened from being a shepherd in following thee, neither have I desired the fatal day, thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was before thy face.
\[17]Be not a terror unto me: thou art my refuge in the day of evil.
\[18]Let them be ashamed that persecute me, but let not me be ashamed; let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed; bring upon them the day of evil, and break them with a double breaking.

\[20]and say unto them, Hear the word of Jehovah, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates;

\[22]and carry forth no burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do any work; but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers,
\[23]but they hearkened not, neither inclined their ear, but hardened their neck, that they might not hear nor receive instruction.
\[24]And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith Jehovah, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, and to hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;
\[25]then shall there enter in, through the gates of this city, kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their princes, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall be inhabited for ever.
\[26]And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places around Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the lowland, and from the hill-country, and from the south, bringing burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and oblations, and incense, and bringing thanksgiving unto the house of Jehovah.
\[27]But if ye will not hearken unto me, to hallow the sabbath day and not to bear a burden and enter in through the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day, then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.

\[5]And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,

\[14]Shall the snow of Lebanon cease from the rock of the field? Shall the cool flowing waters coming from afar be dried up?
\[15]For my people hath forgotten me: they burn incense to vanity; and they have caused them to stumble in their ways, the ancient paths, to walk in by-paths of a way not cast up;
\[16]to make their land an astonishment, a perpetual hissing: every one that passeth by shall be astonished, and shake his head.
\[17]As with an east wind will I scatter them before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.

\[11]and shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again. And they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place to bury.

\[10]For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side: Report, and we will report it. All my familiars are watching for my stumbling: Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him; and we shall take our revenge on him.
\[11]But Jehovah is with me as a mighty terrible one; therefore my persecutors shall stumble and shall not prevail; they shall be greatly ashamed, for they have not prospered: it shall be an everlasting confusion that shall not be forgotten.
\[12]And thou, Jehovah of hosts, who triest the righteous, who seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause.
\[13]Sing ye unto Jehovah, praise Jehovah, for he hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evildoers.
\[14]Cursed be the day wherein I was born; let not the day wherein my mother bore me be blessed!
\[15]Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad!
\[16]And let that man be as the cities which Jehovah overthrew, and repented not; and let him hear a cry in the morning, and a shouting at noonday,
\[17]because he slew me not from the womb. Or would that my mother had been my grave, and her womb always great [with me]!
\[18]Wherefore came I forth from the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed in shame?

he word that came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Malchijah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, saying,
\[2]Inquire, I pray thee, of Jehovah for us; for Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that Jehovah will deal with us according to all his marvellous works, that he may go up from us.
\[3]And Jeremiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:
\[4]Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans who besiege you, outside the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.
\[5]And I myself will fight against you with a stretched-out hand, and with a strong arm, and in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.
\[6]And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.
\[7]And afterwards, saith Jehovah, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life, and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword: he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.
\[8]And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.
\[9]He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth out, and deserteth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.
\[10]For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith Jehovah: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
\[11]And touching the house of the king of Judah, hear ye the word of Jehovah.
\[12]House of David, thus saith Jehovah: Judge with justice in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go forth like fire and burn, and there be none to quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
\[13]Behold, I am against thee, inhabitress of the valley, the rock of the plain, saith Jehovah; ye that say, Who shall come down against us, or who shall enter into our dwellings?
\[14]And I will visit you according to the fruit of your doings, saith Jehovah; and I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it shall devour all that is round about her.

hus saith Jehovah: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,
\[2]and say, Hear the word of Jehovah, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people who enter in through these gates.
\[3]Thus saith Jehovah: Execute judgment and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor; and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, or the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place.
\[4]For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in through the gates of this house kings sitting in the place of David upon his throne, riding in chariots and on horses,—he, and his servants, and his people.
\[5]But if ye will not hear these words, I have sworn by myself, saith Jehovah, that this house shall become a waste.
\[6]For thus saith Jehovah concerning the house of the king of Judah: Thou art a Gilead unto me, the summit of Lebanon: verily I will make thee a wilderness, cities not inhabited.
\[7]And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons; and they shall cut down the choice of thy cedars, and cast [them] into the fire.
\[8]And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus unto this great city?
\[9]And they shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of Jehovah their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.
\[10]Weep not for the dead, neither bemoan him; [but] weep sore for him that goeth away, for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.
\[11]For thus saith Jehovah concerning Shallum the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, who went forth out of this place: He shall not return thither any more;
\[12]for he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.
\[13]Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his upper chambers by injustice; that taketh his neighbour's service without wages, and giveth him not his earning;
\[14]that saith, I will build me a wide house, and spacious upper chambers; and he cutteth out for himself windows; and it is wainscoted with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
\[15]Shalt thou reign, because thou viest with the cedar? Did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice? Then it was well with him.
\[16]He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Was not this to know me? saith Jehovah.
\[17]But thine eyes and thy heart are only on thine extortion, and on the blood of the innocent, to shed it, and on oppression and on violence, to do it.
\[18]Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah: They shall not lament for him, Ah, my brother! or, Ah, sister! They shall not lament for him, Ah, lord! or Ah, his glory!
\[19]He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, dragged along and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
\[20]Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and give forth thy voice in Bashan, and cry from [the heights of] Abarim: for all thy lovers are destroyed.
\[21]I spoke unto thee in thy prosperity; [but] thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy way from thy youth, that thou hearkenedst not unto my voice.
\[22]The wind shall feed on all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity; surely, then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.
\[23]Thou inhabitress of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how pitiful shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, pain as of a woman in travail!
\[24][As] I live, saith Jehovah, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, were a signet upon my right hand, yet will I pluck thee thence;
\[25]and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them before whom thou art afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\[26]And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.
\[27]And into the land whereunto they lift up their souls to return, thither shall they not return.
\[28]Is this man Coniah a despised broken vase? a vessel wherein is no delight? Wherefore are they thrown out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?
\[29]O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Jehovah!
\[30]Thus saith Jehovah: Write this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days; for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.

oe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith Jehovah.
\[2]Therefore thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel concerning the shepherds that feed my people: Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith Jehovah.
\[3]And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their pastures; and they shall be fruitful and shall multiply.
\[4]And I will raise up shepherds over them, who shall feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, saith Jehovah.
\[5]Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, when I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, who shall reign as king, and act wisely, and shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.
\[6]In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell in safety; and this is his name whereby he shall be called, Jehovah our Righteousness.
\[7]Therefore behold, days are coming, saith Jehovah, that they shall no more say, [As] Jehovah liveth, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
\[8]but, [As] Jehovah liveth, who brought up and who led back the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I had driven them. And they shall dwell in their own land.
\[9]Concerning the prophets: My heart within me is broken; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome; because of Jehovah, and because of the words of his holiness.
\[10]For the land is full of adulterers; for because of execration the land mourneth. The pastures of the wilderness are dried up; for their course is evil, and their force is not right.
\[11]For both prophet and priest are profane: even in my house have I found their wickedness, saith Jehovah.
\[12]Therefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness; they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them in the year of their visitation, saith Jehovah.
\[13]And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria: they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.
\[14]And in the prophets of Jerusalem have I seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in falsehood, and strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that none doth return from his wickedness. They are all become unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
\[15]Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.
\[16]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they lead you to vanity; they speak a vision of their own heart, not out of the mouth of Jehovah.
\[17]They say constantly unto them that despise me, Jehovah hath said, Ye shall have peace. And they say unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his heart, No evil shall come upon you.
\[18]For who hath stood in the council of Jehovah, so that he hath perceived and heard his word? who hath hearkened to his word and listened?
\[19]Behold, a tempest of Jehovah, fury is gone forth, yea, a whirling storm: it shall whirl down upon the head of the wicked.
\[20]The anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and until he have performed the purposes of his heart: at the end of the days ye shall understand it clearly.
\[21]I did not send the prophets, yet they ran; I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.
\[22]But if they had stood in my council, and had caused my people to hear my words, then would they have turned them from their evil way and from the wickedness of their doings.
\[23]Am I a God at hand, saith Jehovah, and not a God afar off?
\[24]Can any hide himself in secret places, that I shall not see him? saith Jehovah. Do not I fill the heavens and the earth? saith Jehovah.
\[25]I have heard what the prophets say, who prophesy falsehood in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
\[26]How long shall [this] be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy falsehood, and who are prophets of the deceit of their own heart?
\[27]who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour: as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.
\[28]The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell the dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith Jehovah.
\[29]Is not my word like a fire, saith Jehovah; and like a hammer [that] breaketh the rock in pieces?
\[30]Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that steal my words every one from his neighbour.
\[31]Behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that use their tongues, and say, He hath said.
\[32]Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith Jehovah, and that tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies and by their boasting; and I have not sent them, nor commanded them; and they profit not this people at all, saith Jehovah.
\[33]And when this people, or a prophet, or a priest, ask thee, saying, What is the burden of Jehovah? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will even cast you off, saith Jehovah.
\[34]And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of Jehovah, I will even punish that man and his house.
\[35]Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother: What hath Jehovah answered? and, What hath Jehovah spoken?
\[36]And the burden of Jehovah shall ye mention no more; for every man's own word shall be his burden: for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of Jehovah of hosts, our God.
\[37]Thus shalt thou say to the prophet: What hath Jehovah answered thee? and, What hath Jehovah spoken?
\[38]But since ye say, The burden of Jehovah, therefore thus saith Jehovah: Because ye say this word, The burden of Jehovah, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of Jehovah;
\[39]therefore behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, far from my face, and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers.

ehovah shewed me, and behold, two baskets of figs, set before the temple of Jehovah, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive from Jerusalem, Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, and the craftsmen and smiths, and had brought them to Babylon.
\[2]One basket had very good figs, like the figs first ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten for badness.
\[3]And Jehovah said unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs: the good figs very good; and the bad very bad, which cannot be eaten for badness.
\[4]And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
\[5]Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard for good them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans;
\[6]and I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land; and I will build them and not pull them down, and I will plant them and not pluck them up.
\[7]And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.
\[8]And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten for badness, surely, thus saith Jehovah: So will I make Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the remnant of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt.
\[9]And I will give them over to be driven hither and thither unto all the kingdoms of the earth for evil, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them;
\[10]and I will send among them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, until they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.

he word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah (that is, the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon),
\[2]which Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying:
\[3]From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, the king of Judah, even unto this day, these three and twenty years, the word of Jehovah hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.
\[4]And Jehovah hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear,
\[5]when they said, Turn again now every one from his evil way, and from the wickedness of your doings, and dwell in the land that Jehovah hath given unto you and to your fathers from of old even for ever.
\[6]And go not after other gods, to serve them and to worship them; and provoke me not to anger with the work of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.
\[7]But ye have not hearkened unto me, saith Jehovah; that ye might provoke me to anger with the work of your hands, to your own hurt.
\[8]Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Because ye have not listened to my words,
\[9]behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith Jehovah, and [I will send] to Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual wastes.
\[10]And I will cause to perish from them the voice of mirth and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.
\[11]And this whole land shall become a waste, an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
\[12]And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, [that] I will visit on the king of Babylon and on that nation, saith Jehovah, their iniquity, and on the land of the Chaldeans, and I will make it perpetual desolations.
\[13]And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.
\[14]For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also; and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.
\[15]For thus hath Jehovah the God of Israel said unto me: Take the cup of the wine of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations to whom I send thee to drink it.
\[16]And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.
\[17]And I took the cup at Jehovah's hand, and made all the nations to drink, to whom Jehovah had sent me:
\[18]Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a waste, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;
\[19]Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;
\[20]and all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gazah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;
\[21]Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon;
\[22]and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles that are beyond the sea;
\[23]Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that have the corners [of their beard] cut off;
\[24]and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert;
\[25]and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;
\[26]and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth; and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
\[27]And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink, and be drunken, and vomit, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword that I will send among you.
\[28]And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup from thy hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ye shall certainly drink.
\[29]For behold, I begin to bring evil on the city that is called by my name, and should ye be altogether unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished; for I call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith Jehovah of hosts.
\[30]And thou, prophesy unto them all these words, and say unto them, Jehovah will roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he will mightily roar upon his dwelling-place, he will give a shout, as they that tread [the vintage], against all the inhabitants of the earth.
\[31]The noise shall come to the end of the earth: for Jehovah hath a controversy with the nations, he entereth into judgment with all flesh; as for the wicked, he will give them up to the sword, saith Jehovah.
\[32]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great storm shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth.
\[33]And the slain of Jehovah shall [be] at that day from [one] end of the earth even unto the [other] end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the face of the ground.
\[34]Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves [in the dust], noble ones of the flock: for the days of your slaughter are accomplished, and I will disperse you; and ye shall fall like a precious vessel.
\[35]And refuge shall perish from the shepherds, and escape from the noble ones of the flock.
\[36]There shall be a voice of the cry of the shepherds, and a howling of the noble ones of the flock: for Jehovah layeth waste their pasture;
\[37]and the peaceable enclosures shall be desolated, because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.
\[38]He hath forsaken his covert as a young lion; for their land is a desolation because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.

n the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, came this word from Jehovah, saying,
\[2]Thus saith Jehovah: Stand in the court of Jehovah's house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in Jehovah's house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them: diminish not a word.
\[3]Peradventure they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do unto them because of the wickedness of their doings.
\[4]And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah: If ye will not hearken unto me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,
\[5]to hearken unto the words of my servants the prophets, whom I have sent unto you, even rising early and sending [them], but ye have not hearkened,
\[6]—then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
\[7]And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jehovah.
\[8]And it came to pass when Jeremiah had ended speaking all that Jehovah had commanded [him] to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, Thou shalt certainly die.
\[9]Why hast thou prophesied in the name of Jehovah, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah.
\[10]And the princes of Judah heard these things; and they went up from the king's house unto the house of Jehovah, and sat in the entry of the new gate of Jehovah.
\[11]And the priests and the prophets spoke unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die, for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.
\[12]And Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying, Jehovah sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.
\[13]And now, amend your ways and your doings, and hearken to the voice of Jehovah your God; and Jehovah will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.
\[14]But as for me, behold, I am in your hand; do unto me as seemeth good and right in your eyes:
\[15]only know for certain that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof; for of a truth Jehovah hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.
\[16]And the princes and all the people said unto the priests and to the prophets, This man is not worthy to die; for he hath spoken to us in the name of Jehovah our God.
\[17]And there rose up certain of the elders of the land and spoke to all the congregation of the people, saying,
\[18]Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Zion shall be ploughed [as] a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
\[19]Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? Did he not fear Jehovah, and supplicate Jehovah, and Jehovah repented him of the evil that he had pronounced against them? And we should be doing a great evil against our souls.
\[20]And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of Jehovah, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim: and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah;
\[21]and Jehoiakim the king, and all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, and the king sought to put him to death; but Urijah heard it, and he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt.
\[22]And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and men with him, into Egypt;
\[23]and they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king; and he slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the children of the people.

n the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, came this word to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
\[2]Thus hath Jehovah said unto me: Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck;
\[3]and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers that come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah.
\[4]And give them a charge unto their masters, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Thus shall ye say unto your masters:
\[5]I have made the earth, man and beast that are upon the face of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm; and I give them unto whom it seemeth right in mine eyes.
\[6]And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field also have I given him to serve him.
\[7]And all the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the time of his land also come, when many nations and great kings shall reduce him to servitude.
\[8]And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I visit, saith Jehovah, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.
\[9]And ye, hearken not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, who speak unto you saying: Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon.
\[10]For they prophesy falsehood unto you, to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.
\[11]But the nation that bringeth its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serveth him, will I let remain still in its own land, saith Jehovah; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.
\[12]And I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
\[13]Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as Jehovah hath spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
\[14]And hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy falsehood unto you.
\[15]For I have not sent them, saith Jehovah, yet they prophesy falsely in my name; in order that I should drive you out, and that ye should perish, ye, and the prophets who prophesy unto you.
\[16]And I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of Jehovah's house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon; for they prophesy falsehood unto you.
\[17]Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city become a waste?
\[18]But if they be prophets, and if the word of Jehovah be with them, let them now make intercession to Jehovah of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.
\[19]For thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,
\[20]which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
\[21]yea, thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:
\[22]They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day of my visiting them, saith Jehovah; then I will bring them up, and restore them to this place.

nd it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, [that] Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of Jehovah, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,
\[2]Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
\[3]Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Jehovah's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon;
\[4]and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah that went to Babylon, saith Jehovah: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
\[5]And the prophet Jeremiah spoke unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of Jehovah.
\[6]And the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen, may Jehovah do so! may Jehovah perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again from Babylon, into this place, the vessels of Jehovah's house, and all them of the captivity!
\[7]Nevertheless, hear, I pray thee, this word which I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people:
\[8]The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old, prophesied also concerning many countries and concerning great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
\[9]The prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, shall be known as the prophet whom Jehovah hath really sent.
\[10]And the prophet Hananiah took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and broke it.
\[11]And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: So will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
\[12]And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, after that the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
\[13]Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou hast broken the yokes of wood, and thou hast made in their place yokes of iron.
\[14]For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.
\[15]And the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah, Hear now, Hananiah: Jehovah hath not sent thee; and thou makest this people to trust in falsehood.
\[16]Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, for thou hast spoken revolt against Jehovah.
\[17]And the prophet Hananiah died in the same year in the seventh month.

nd these are the words of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon
\[2](after that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, had departed from Jerusalem);
\[3]by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkijah (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon, unto Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), saying,
\[4]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all the captivity, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon:
\[5]Build houses, and dwell in them, and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
\[6]Take wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply there, and be not diminished.
\[7]And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray unto Jehovah for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.
\[8]For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Let not your prophets that are in your midst, nor your diviners deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams, which ye like to dream.
\[9]For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith Jehovah.
\[10]For thus saith Jehovah: When seventy years shall be accomplished for Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in bringing you back to this place.
\[11]For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith Jehovah, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you in your latter end a hope.
\[12]And ye shall call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you;
\[13]and ye shall seek me and find me, for ye shall search for me with all your heart,
\[14]and I will be found of you, saith Jehovah. And I will turn your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith Jehovah; and I will bring you again into the place whence I have caused you to be carried away captive.
\[15]If ye say, Jehovah hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;
\[16]yea, thus saith Jehovah concerning the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people that dwell in this city, your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;
\[17]thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will send against them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like the vile figs, that cannot be eaten for badness.
\[18]And I will pursue them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will give them over to be driven hither and thither into all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an execration, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I will drive them:
\[19]because they have not hearkened to my words, saith Jehovah, wherewith I sent unto them my servants the prophets, rising early and sending; but ye have not hearkened, saith Jehovah.
\[20]But ye, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon, hear the word of Jehovah.
\[21]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy falsehood unto you in my name: Behold, I will give them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall smite them before your eyes.
\[22]And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah that are in Babylon, saying, Jehovah make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;
\[23]because they have committed infamy in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken words of falsehood in my name, which I had not commanded them: and I [am] he that knoweth, and [am] witness, saith Jehovah.
\[24]And thou shalt speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,
\[25]Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
\[26]Jehovah hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that there should be officers [in] the house of Jehovah, over every madman and self-made prophet, that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in the shackles.
\[27]And now, why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, who maketh himself a prophet to you?
\[28]Forasmuch as he hath sent unto us in Babylon, saying, It will be long; build houses, and dwell [in them], and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
\[29]—And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of the prophet Jeremiah.
\[30]And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,
\[31]Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he hath caused you to trust in falsehood;
\[32]therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he see the good that I will do for my people, saith Jehovah; because he hath spoken revolt against Jehovah.

he word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
\[2]Thus speaketh Jehovah the God of Israel, saying, Write thee in a book all the words that I have spoken unto thee.
\[3]For behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, when I will turn the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith Jehovah; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
\[4]And these are the words that Jehovah hath spoken concerning Israel and concerning Judah;
\[5]for thus saith Jehovah: We have heard a voice of trembling, there is fear, and no peace.
\[6]Ask ye now, and see, whether a male doth travail with child? Wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail; and all faces are turned into paleness?
\[7]Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.
\[8]And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more reduce him to servitude.
\[9]But they shall serve Jehovah their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.
\[10]And thou, my servant Jacob, fear not, saith Jehovah; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for behold, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and at ease, and none shall make [him] afraid.
\[11]For I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to save thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee; yet of thee will I not make a full end, but I will correct thee with judgment, and will not hold thee altogether guiltless.
\[12]For thus saith Jehovah: Thy bruise is incurable, thy wound is grievous.
\[13]There is none to plead thy cause, to bind up [thy wound]; thou hast no healing medicines.
\[14]All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not. For I have smitten thee with the stroke of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of thine iniquity: thy sins are manifold.
\[15]Why criest thou because of thy bruise? thy sorrow is incurable; for the greatness of thine iniquity, [because] thy sins are manifold, I have done these things unto thee.
\[16]Therefore all that devour thee shall be devoured, and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be for a spoil; and all they that prey upon thee will I give to be a prey.
\[17]For I will apply a bandage unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith Jehovah; for they have called thee an outcast: This is Zion that no man seeketh after.
\[18]Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will turn the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his habitations; and the city shall be built upon her own heap; and the palace shall be inhabited after the manner thereof.
\[19]And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving, and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be diminished; and I will honour them, and they shall not be small.
\[20]And their sons shall be as aforetime; and their assembly shall be established before me; and I will punish all that oppress them.
\[21]And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to approach, and he shall draw near unto me. For who is this that engageth his heart to draw near unto me? saith Jehovah.
\[22]And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
\[23]Behold, a tempest of Jehovah, fury is gone forth, a sweeping storm: it shall whirl down upon the head of the wicked.
\[24]The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and until he have performed the purposes of his heart. At the end of the days ye shall consider it.

t that time, saith Jehovah, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.
\[2]Thus saith Jehovah: The people [that were] left of the sword have found grace in the wilderness, [even] Israel, when I go to give him rest.
\[3]Jehovah hath appeared from afar unto me, [saying,] Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love; therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee.
\[4]I will build thee again, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel! Thou shalt again be adorned with thy tambours, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.
\[5]Thou shalt again plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant, and shall eat the fruit.
\[6]For there shall be a day, when the watchmen upon mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise, and let us go up to Zion, unto Jehovah our God.
\[7]For thus saith Jehovah: Sing aloud [with] gladness for Jacob, and shout at the head of the nations; publish ye, praise ye, and say, Jehovah, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.
\[8]Behold, I bring them from the north country, and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth; [and] among them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great assemblage shall they return hither.
\[9]They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them; I will cause them to walk by water-brooks, in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble; for I will be a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.
\[10]Hear the word of Jehovah, ye nations, and declare [it] to the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd his flock.
\[11]For Jehovah hath ransomed Jacob, and redeemed him from the hand of one stronger than he.
\[12]And they shall come and sing aloud upon the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of Jehovah, for corn, and for new wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd; and their soul shall be as a watered garden, and they shall not languish any more at all.
\[13]Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and old together; for I will turn their mourning into gladness, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice after their sorrow.
\[14]And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith Jehovah.
\[15]Thus saith Jehovah: A voice hath been heard in Ramah, the wail of very bitter weeping,—Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted for her children, because they are not.
\[16]Thus saith Jehovah: Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears; for there is a reward for thy work, saith Jehovah; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.
\[17]And there is hope for thy latter end, saith Jehovah, and thy children shall come again to their own border.
\[18]I have indeed heard Ephraim bemoaning himself [thus]: Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised as a bullock not trained: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art Jehovah my God.
\[19]Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after I knew myself, I smote upon [my] thigh. I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, for I bear the reproach of my youth.
\[20]Is Ephraim a dear son unto me? is he a child of delights? For whilst I have been speaking against him, I do constantly remember him still. Therefore my bowels are troubled for him: I will certainly have mercy upon him, saith Jehovah.
\[21]Set up waymarks, make for thyself signposts; set thy heart toward the highway, the way by which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.
\[22]How long wilt thou wander about, thou backsliding daughter? For Jehovah hath created a new thing on the earth, a woman shall encompass a man.
\[23]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: They shall again use this speech, in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall turn their captivity: Jehovah bless thee, O habitation of righteousness, mountain of holiness!
\[24]And therein shall dwell Judah, and all the cities thereof together, the husbandmen, and they that go about with flocks.
\[25]For I have satiated the weary soul, and every languishing soul have I replenished.
\[26]—Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
\[27]Behold, days come, saith Jehovah, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah [with] the seed of man and the seed of beast.
\[28]And it shall come to pass, as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to overthrow, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them to build, and to plant, saith Jehovah.
\[29]In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge:
\[30]for every one shall die for his own iniquity; every man that eateth the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.
\[31]Behold, days come, saith Jehovah, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
\[32]not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day of my taking them by the hand, to lead them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they broke, although I was a husband unto them, saith Jehovah.
\[33]For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, saith Jehovah: I will put my law in their inward parts, and will write it in their heart; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
\[34]And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith Jehovah: for I will pardon their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more.
\[35]Thus saith Jehovah, who giveth the sun for light by day, the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for light by night, who stirreth up the sea so that the waves thereof roar,—Jehovah of hosts is his name:
\[36]If those ordinances depart from before me, saith Jehovah, the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.
\[37]Thus saith Jehovah: If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off the whole seed of Israel, for all that they have done, saith Jehovah.
\[38]Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that the city shall be built to Jehovah, from the tower of Hananeel unto the corner-gate.
\[39]And the measuring line shall yet go forth before it unto the hill Gareb, and shall turn toward Goath.
\[40]And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the torrent Kidron, unto the corner of the horse-gate toward the east, shall be holy unto Jehovah: it shall not be plucked up, nor overthrown any more for ever.

he word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah: that year was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
\[2]And the king of Babylon's army was then besieging Jerusalem; and the prophet Jeremiah was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah's house.
\[3]For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why dost thou prophesy and say, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
\[4]and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans; for he shall certainly be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;
\[5]and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith Jehovah: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?
\[6]And Jeremiah said, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
\[7]Behold, Hanameel, the son of Shallum thine uncle, shall come unto thee, saying, Buy for thyself my field which is in Anathoth; for thine is the right of redemption, to buy [it].
\[8]And Hanameel, mine uncle's son, came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Jehovah, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine: buy [it] for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of Jehovah.
\[9]And I bought of Hanameel, mine uncle's son, the field which is in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, seventeen shekels of silver.
\[10]And I subscribed the writing, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed the money in the balances.
\[11]And I took the writing of the purchase, that which was sealed [according to] the law and the statutes, and that which was open;
\[12]and I gave the writing of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Nerijah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's [son], and in the presence of the witnesses that had subscribed the writing of purchase, before all the Jews that were sitting in the court of the guard.
\[13]And I charged Baruch in their presence, saying,
\[14]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these writings, this writing of the purchase, both that which is sealed and this writing which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may remain many days.
\[15]For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be purchased in this land.
\[16]And after I had given the writing of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Nerijah, I prayed unto Jehovah saying,
\[17]Alas, Lord Jehovah! Behold, thou hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and stretched-out arm; there is nothing too hard for thee:
\[18]who shewest mercy unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them, thou, the great, the mighty God,—Jehovah of hosts is his name;
\[19]great in counsel and mighty in work, whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the children of men, to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:
\[20]who hast displayed signs and wonders unto this day, in the land of Egypt and in Israel and among [other] men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day.
\[21]And thou broughtest forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt by signs, and by wonders, and by a powerful hand, and by a stretched-out arm, and by great terror;
\[22]and didst give them this land, which thou hadst sworn unto their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.
\[23]And they came in and possessed it: but they hearkened not unto thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do; so that thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them.
\[24]Behold the mounds, they are come unto the city for taking it; and the city is given over into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, by the sword, and the famine, and the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and behold, thou seest [it].
\[25]And thou, Lord Jehovah, thou hast said unto me, Buy for thyself the field for money, and take witnesses;—and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\[26]And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,
\[27]Behold, I am Jehovah, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?
\[28]Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.
\[29]And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come in and set fire to this city, and shall burn it, and the houses upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink-offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.
\[30]For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have been doing only evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith Jehovah.
\[31]For this city hath been to me [a provocation] of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,
\[32]because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[33]And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face; and though I taught them, rising early and teaching, they hearkened not to receive instruction.
\[34]And they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it;
\[35]and they have built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause to pass through [the fire] their sons and their daughters unto Molech: which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
\[36]And now therefore Jehovah, the God of Israel, saith thus concerning this city, whereof ye say, It hath been given over into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:
\[37]Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries whither I have driven them, in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely.
\[38]And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
\[39]And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me all [their] days, for the good of them, and of their children after them.
\[40]And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not draw back from them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their heart, that they may not turn aside from me.
\[41]And I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will assuredly plant them in this land with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
\[42]For thus saith Jehovah: Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have spoken concerning them.
\[43]And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\[44][Men] shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the writings, and seal them, and take witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the environs of Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the south: for I will turn their captivity, saith Jehovah.

\[3]Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and I will shew thee great and hidden things, which thou knowest not.
\[4]For thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down because of the mounds and because of the sword:
\[5]They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but to fill them with the dead bodies of the men whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.
\[6]Behold, I will apply a healing dressing to it and cure, and I will heal them, and will reveal unto them an abundance of peace and truth.
\[7]And I will turn the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel, and will build them, as at the beginning.
\[8]And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me, and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned against me, and whereby they have transgressed against me.
\[9]And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear of all the good that I do unto them; and they shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.
\[10]Thus saith Jehovah: In this place of which ye say, It is waste, without man and without beast! in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,
\[11]there shall again be heard the voice of mirth and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that say, Give ye thanks unto Jehovah of hosts; for Jehovah is good, for his loving-kindness [endureth] for ever,—of them that bring thanksgiving unto the house of Jehovah. For I will turn the captivity of the land as in the beginning, saith Jehovah.
\[12]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In this place which is waste, without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, there shall again be a habitation of shepherds causing [their] flocks to lie down.
\[13]In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the environs of Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that counteth [them], saith Jehovah.
\[14]Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will perform the good word which I have spoken unto the house of Israel and unto the house of Judah.
\[15]In those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.
\[16]In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell in safety. And this is the name wherewith she shall be called: Jehovah our Righteousness.
\[17]For thus saith Jehovah: There shall never fail to David a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;
\[18]neither shall there fail to the priests the Levites a man before me to offer up burnt-offerings, and to burn oblations, and to do sacrifice continually.
\[19]And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,
\[20]Thus saith Jehovah: If ye can break my covenant [in respect] of the day, and my covenant [in respect] of the night, so that there should not be day and night in their season,
\[21][then] shall also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites, the priests, my ministers.
\[22]As the host of the heavens cannot be numbered, nor the sand of the sea measured, so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.
\[23]And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,
\[24]Hast thou not seen what this people have spoken, saying, The two families that Jehovah had chosen, he hath even cast them off? And they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.
\[25]Thus saith Jehovah: If my covenant of day and night [stand] not, if I have not appointed the ordinances of the heavens and the earth,
\[26][then] will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David my servant, so as not to take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will turn their captivity, and will have mercy on them.

he word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion, and all the peoples, fought against Jerusalem and against all the cities thereof, saying,
\[2]Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
\[3]And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt certainly be taken, and given into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and his mouth shall speak with thy mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.
\[4]Only, hear the word of Jehovah, O Zedekiah king of Judah. Thus saith Jehovah as to thee: Thou shalt not die by the sword;
\[5]thou shalt die in peace, and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings that were before thee, so shall they burn for thee; and they will lament for thee, Ah, lord! for I have spoken the word, saith Jehovah.
\[6]And the prophet Jeremiah spoke all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem.
\[7]And the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah; for these were amongst the cities of Judah, the fenced cities that were left.
\[8]The word that came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, after that king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people that were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them:
\[9]that every man should let his bondman, and every man his bondmaid, the Hebrew and the Hebrewess, go free, that none should exact service of them, [that is,] of a Jew his brother.
\[10]And all the princes and all the people that had entered into the covenant obeyed, every man letting his bondman and every man his bondmaid go free, that none should exact service of them any more: they obeyed, and let [them] go.
\[11]But afterwards they turned, and caused the bondmen and the bondmaids whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for bondmen and for bondmaids.
\[12]And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
\[13]Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,
\[14]At the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother, a Hebrew, who hath sold himself unto thee; when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee. But your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.
\[15]And you, ye had this day turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:
\[16]but ye have turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his bondman, and every man his bondmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and ye have brought them into subjection, to be unto you for bondmen and for bondmaids.
\[17]Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith Jehovah, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will give you over to be driven hither and thither among all the kingdoms of the earth.
\[18]And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me,—the calf which they cut in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,
\[19]—the princes of Judah and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, that passed between the parts of the calf;
\[20]them will I give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life; and their carcases shall be food for the fowl of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth.
\[21]And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.
\[22]Behold, I command, saith Jehovah, and I will cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.

\[2]Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak with them, and bring them into the house of Jehovah, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.
\[3]And I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites,
\[4]and I brought them into the house of Jehovah, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold.
\[5]And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink wine.
\[6]And they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, ye nor your sons for ever;
\[7]neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor shall ye have [any]; but all your days ye shall dwell in tents, that ye may live many days in the land where ye sojourn.
\[8]And we have hearkened unto the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters,
\[9]and not to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed;
\[10]but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
\[11]And it came to pass when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come and let us go into Jerusalem because of the army of the Chaldeans, and because of the army of Syria; and we dwell at Jerusalem.
\[12]And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,
\[13]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken unto my words? saith Jehovah.
\[14]The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; and to this day they have drunk none, for they have obeyed their father's commandment. But I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking, and ye have not hearkened unto me.
\[15]And I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them; and ye shall dwell in the land that I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearkened unto me.
\[16]Yea, the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people hath not hearkened unto me;
\[17]therefore thus saith Jehovah the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken unto them, but they have not hearkened, and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.
\[18]And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his injunctions, and have done according unto all that he hath commanded you;
\[19]therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, There shall not fail to Jonadab the son of Rechab a man to stand before me, for ever.

\[2]Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.
\[3]It may be the house of Judah will hear all the evil that I purpose to do unto them, that they may return every man from his evil way, and that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
\[4]And Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Nerijah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.
\[5]And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up, I cannot go into the house of Jehovah; but go thou in,
\[6]and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in the house of Jehovah upon the fast day; and thou shalt also read them in the ears of all Judah that come from their cities.
\[7]It may be they will present their supplication before Jehovah, and that they will return every one from his evil way; for great is the anger and the fury that Jehovah hath pronounced against this people.
\[8]And Baruch the son of Nerijah did according to all that the prophet Jeremiah commanded him, reading in the book the words of Jehovah in Jehovah's house.
\[9]And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, in the ninth month, [that] they proclaimed a fast before Jehovah, for all the people in Jerusalem, and for all the people that came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem.
\[10]And Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of the house of Jehovah, in the ears of all the people.
\[11]And Micah the son of Gemariah the son of Shaphan heard out of the book all the words of Jehovah;
\[12]and he went down to the king's house, into the scribe's chamber, and behold, all the princes were sitting there: Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.
\[13]And Micah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read in the book in the ears of the people.
\[14]And all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thy hand the roll in which thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. And Baruch the son of Nerijah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.
\[15]And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. And Baruch read [it] in their ears.
\[16]And it came to pass, when they heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said unto Baruch, We will certainly report to the king all these words.
\[17]And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words from his mouth?
\[18]And Baruch said unto them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote [them] with ink in the book.
\[19]And the princes said unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; that none may know where ye are.
\[20]And they went in unto the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king.
\[21]And the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll, and he fetched it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king.
\[22]Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month, and with the fire-pan burning before him.
\[23]And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four columns, he cut it with the scribe's knife, and cast it into the fire that was in the pan until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the pan.
\[24]And they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, [neither] the king nor any of his servants that heard all these words.
\[25]Moreover, Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll; but he would not hear them.
\[26]And the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Jehovah hid them.
\[27]And after that the king had burned the roll, and the words that Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,
\[28]Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.
\[29]And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from it man and beast?
\[30]Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.
\[31]And I will visit their iniquity upon him, and upon his seed, and upon his servants; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; and they have not hearkened.
\[32]And Jeremiah took another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Nerijah; and he wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah, all the words of the book that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides unto them many like words.

\[3]And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto Jehovah our God for us.
\[4]And Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison.
\[5]And Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they went up from Jerusalem.
\[6]And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
\[7]Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to inquire of me: Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.
\[8]And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.
\[9]Thus saith Jehovah: Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans are certainly gone away from us; for they are not gone.
\[10]For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained [but] wounded men among them, [yet] should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.
\[11]And it came to pass when the army of the Chaldeans was gone up from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh's army,
\[12]that Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to have his portion there among the people.
\[13]And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard was there whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Thou art deserting to the Chaldeans.
\[14]And Jeremiah said, It is false: I am not deserting to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him; and Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.
\[15]And the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in the place of confinement in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.
\[16]When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon and into the vaults, and Jeremiah had remained there many days,
\[17]king Zedekiah sent and took him out. And the king asked of him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from Jehovah? And Jeremiah said, There is; and he said, Thou shalt be given into the hand of the king of Babylon.
\[18]And Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in the prison?
\[19]And where are your prophets that prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?
\[20]And now hear, I pray thee, my lord, O king: let my supplication, I pray thee, come before thee; and cause me not to return into the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
\[21]Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard, and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city was spent. And Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard.

\[3]Thus saith Jehovah: This city shall certainly be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, and he shall take it.
\[4]And the princes said unto the king, Let this man, we pray thee, be put to death; for why should he weaken the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking to them according to these words? for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
\[5]And king Zedekiah said, Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not he that can do a thing against you.
\[6]Then they took Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the son of Hammelech, which was in the court of the guard, and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.
\[7]And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon—now the king was sitting in the gate of Benjamin,
\[8]—and Ebed-melech went forth out of the king's house, and spoke to the king, saying,
\[9]My lord, O king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to the prophet Jeremiah, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he will die by reason of the famine in the place where he is; for there is no more bread in the city.
\[10]And the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.
\[11]And Ebed-melech took the men under his order, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old shreds and worn-out clothes, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
\[12]And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Put, I pray, [these] old shreds and rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.
\[13]And they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and brought him up out of the dungeon; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
\[14]And king Zedekiah sent and took the prophet Jeremiah unto him, into the third entry that is in the house of Jehovah; and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing: hide nothing from me.
\[15]And Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare [it] unto thee, wilt thou not certainly put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me.
\[16]And king Zedekiah swore secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, [As] Jehovah liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.
\[17]And Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, Thus saith Jehovah the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If thou wilt freely go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house.
\[18]But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.
\[19]And king Zedekiah said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest they give me over into their hand, and they mock me.
\[20]And Jeremiah said, They shall not give [thee] over. Hearken, I beseech thee, unto the voice of Jehovah, in that which I speak unto thee; so shall it be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.
\[21]But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word which Jehovah hath shewn me:
\[22]Behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes; and they shall say, Thy familiar friends have set thee on, and have prevailed over thee; thy feet are sunk in the mire, they are turned away back.
\[23]And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand; for thou shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon, and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.
\[24]And Zedekiah said unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.
\[25]And if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; and what hath the king said unto thee?
\[26]then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.

\[4]And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains that are upon thy hand. If it seem good in thy sight to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will keep mine eye upon thee; but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me to Babylon, forbear. See, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good and right in thy sight to go, thither go.

\[15]And Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will smite Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and no man shall know it: why should he take thy life, and all they of Judah who are gathered unto thee be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?
\[16]But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing; for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.

nd it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the royal seed, and [one] of the king's chief men, and ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam unto Mizpah, and there they ate bread together, in Mizpah.
\[2]And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.
\[3]And Ishmael smote all the Jews that were with him, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, the men of war.
\[4]And it came to pass the second day after he had killed Gedaliah, and no man knew it,
\[5]that there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, eighty men, having their beards shaven and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves; with oblations and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Jehovah.
\[6]And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went; and it came to pass when he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
\[7]And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, he and the men that were with him, slew them, [and cast them] into the midst of the pit.
\[8]But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Do not kill us, for we have hidden stores in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbore, and did not kill them among their brethren.
\[9]And the pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain by the side of Gedaliah was the one which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
\[10]And Ishmael carried away captive all the remnant of the people that were in Mizpah, the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.
\[11]And Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done;
\[12]and they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are at Gibeon.
\[13]And it came to pass when all the people that were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad.
\[14]And all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.
\[15]But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.
\[16]Then Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon;
\[17]and they departed, and dwelt at Geruth-Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,
\[18]because of the Chaldeans; for they feared them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had smitten Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.

\[2]came near and said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication come before thee, and pray for us unto Jehovah thy God, for all this remnant (for we are left a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us);
\[3]that Jehovah thy God may shew us the way wherein we should walk, and the thing that we should do.
\[4]And Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard; behold, I will pray unto Jehovah your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass [that] whatsoever thing Jehovah shall answer you, I will declare it unto you: I will keep nothing back from you.
\[5]And they said to Jeremiah, Jehovah be a true and faithful witness amongst us, if we do not even according to all the word for which Jehovah thy God shall send thee to us.
\[6]Whether it be good or whether it be evil, we will hearken unto the voice of Jehovah our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us when we hearken unto the voice of Jehovah our God.

\[8]And he called Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest,
\[9]and said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel, to whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him:
\[10]If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not overthrow [you], and I will plant you, and not pluck [you] up; for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.
\[11]Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid: be not afraid of him, saith Jehovah; for I will be with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.
\[12]And I will grant mercies to you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.
\[13]But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land; so as not to hearken unto the voice of Jehovah your God,
\[14]saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger for bread; and there will we dwell;
\[15]—and now, therefore, hear the word of Jehovah, ye remnant of Judah: thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: If ye really set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there,
\[16]then it shall come to pass, that the sword which ye fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye are afraid, shall follow hard after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.
\[17]And it shall be that all the men that have set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.
\[18]For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: As mine anger and my fury have been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt; and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach, and ye shall see this place no more.
\[19]Jehovah hath said concerning you, the remnant of Judah, Go ye not into Egypt. Know certainly that I have admonished you this day.
\[20]For ye deceived yourselves in your own souls, when ye sent me unto Jehovah your God, saying, Pray for us unto Jehovah our God; and according to all that Jehovah our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it.
\[21]And I have this day declared [it] to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah your God, nor anything for which he hath sent me unto you.
\[22]And now know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go to sojourn.

\[3]but Baruch the son of Nerijah is setting thee on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.

\[10]and say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones which I have hidden, and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.
\[11]And he shall come and smite the land of Egypt: such as are for death to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword.
\[12]And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt, and he shall burn them, and carry them away captive; and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.
\[13]And he shall break the pillars of Beth-shemesh, which is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire.

he word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who dwelt in the land of Egypt, who dwelt at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,
\[2]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and behold they are, this day, a waste, and no man dwelleth therein,
\[3]because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense to serve other gods which they knew not, they, [nor] ye, nor your fathers.
\[4]And I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing which I hate!
\[5]But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.
\[6]And my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are become a waste, a desolation, as at this day.
\[7]And now thus saith Jehovah the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Wherefore commit ye great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, to leave you no remnant;
\[8]provoking me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are come to sojourn, that ye should be cut off, and that ye should be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
\[9]Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\[10]They are not humbled unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes which I set before you and before your fathers.
\[11]Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.
\[12]And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to enter into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed: in the land of Egypt shall they fall; they shall be consumed by the sword [and] by the famine, from the least even unto the greatest; they shall die by the sword and by the famine, and they shall be an execration, an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
\[13]And I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;
\[14]and none of the remnant of Judah, that have come into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, so as to return into the land of Judah, whither they have a desire to return to dwell there; for none shall return but such as shall escape.
\[15]Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assemblage, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
\[16][As for] the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of Jehovah, we will not hearken unto thee,
\[17]but we will certainly do every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out drink-offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and we had plenty of bread, and were well, and saw no evil.
\[18]But since we left off burning incense to the queen of the heavens, and pouring out drink-offerings to her, we have wanted everything, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.
\[19]And when we burned incense to the queen of the heavens and poured out drink-offerings to her, did we make for her cakes to portray her, and pour out drink-offerings to her, without our husbands?
\[20]And Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people that had given him that answer, saying,
\[21]Is it not the incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes and the people of the land, that Jehovah remembered, and that came into his mind?
\[22]And Jehovah could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, [and] because of the abominations that ye had committed; and your land is become a waste, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as at this day.
\[23]Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not hearkened unto the voice of Jehovah, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil hath come upon you, as at this day.
\[24]And Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt.
\[25]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hands, saying, We will certainly perform our vows which we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her. Ye will certainly establish your vows, and entirely perform your vows.
\[26]Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith Jehovah, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, [As] the Lord Jehovah liveth.
\[27]Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.
\[28]And they that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, a very small company; and all the remnant of Judah, that have come into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine or theirs.
\[29]And this shall be the sign unto you, saith Jehovah, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall certainly stand against you for evil:
\[30]thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will give Pharaoh-Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.

\[2]Of Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh-Necho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates at Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah.
\[3]Make ready buckler and shield, and draw near to battle!
\[4]Harness the horses, and mount ye horsemen, and stand forth with helmets; polish the spears, put on the coats of mail!
\[5]Why do I see them dismayed, turned away back? And their mighty ones are beaten down, and take to flight, and look not back? Terror [is] on every side, saith Jehovah.
\[6]Let not the swift flee away, neither let the mighty man escape!—Toward the north, hard by the river Euphrates, they have stumbled and fallen.
\[7]Who is this [that] riseth up as the Nile, whose waters toss themselves like the rivers?
\[8]It is Egypt that riseth up as the Nile, and [his] waters toss themselves like the rivers; and he saith, I will rise up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.
\[9]Go up, ye horses, and drive furiously, ye chariots; and let the mighty men go forth: Cush and Phut that handle the shield, and the Ludim that handle the bow [and] bend it.
\[10]For this is the day of the Lord Jehovah of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may be avenged of his adversaries; and the sword shall devour, and it shall be sated and made drunk with their blood; for the Lord Jehovah of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country, by the river Euphrates.
\[11]Go up to Gilead, and fetch balm, O virgin-daughter of Egypt! In vain shalt thou multiply remedies: there is no healing for thee.
\[12]The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the earth; for the mighty man stumbleth against the mighty, they are both fallen together.
\[13]The word that Jehovah spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, concerning the coming of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to smite the land of Egypt:
\[14]Declare in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph, and in Tahpanhes; say, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword devoureth round about thee.
\[15]Why are thy valiants swept away? They stood not, for Jehovah did thrust them down.
\[16]He made many to stumble, yea, one fell upon another; and they said, Arise, and let us return to our own people and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.
\[17]There did they cry, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath let the time appointed go by.
\[18][As] I live, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts, surely as Tabor among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.
\[19]Thou, inhabitress, daughter of Egypt, furnish for thyself a captive's baggage, for Noph shall be a desolation and shall be ruined, so that none shall dwell therein.
\[20]Egypt is a very fair heifer; the gad-fly cometh, it cometh from the north.
\[21]Also her hired men in the midst of her are like fatted bullocks; for they also have turned back, they have fled away together, they did not stand; for the day of their calamity is come upon them, the time of their visitation.
\[22]Her voice shall go like a serpent's; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.
\[23]They shall cut down her forest, saith Jehovah, though it be impenetrable; for they are more than the locusts, and are innumerable.
\[24]The daughter of Egypt is put to shame; she is delivered into the hand of the people of the north.
\[25]Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saith, Behold, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, and her gods, and her kings; yea, Pharaoh and them that confide in him.
\[26]And I will give them into the hand of those that seek their life, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants; but afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith Jehovah.
\[27]But thou, my servant Jacob, fear not, neither be dismayed, Israel: for behold, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make [him] afraid.
\[28]Fear thou not, my servant Jacob, saith Jehovah: for I am with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee with judgment, and I will not hold thee altogether guiltless.

\[5]Baldness is come upon Gazah; Ashkelon is cut off, the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?
\[6]Alas! sword of Jehovah, how long wilt thou not be quiet? Withdraw into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.

\[2]Moab's praise is no more; in Heshbon they have devised evil against her: Come, and let us cut her off from [being] a nation. Thou also, O Madmen, shalt be cut down; the sword shall pursue thee.
\[3]A voice of crying from Horonaim; wasting and great destruction!
\[4]Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
\[5]For by the ascent of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the descent of Horonaim is heard the anguish of the cry of destruction.
\[6]Flee, save your lives, and be like a shrub in the wilderness.
\[7]For because thou hast confided in thy works and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken, and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity, his priests and his princes together.
\[8]And the waster shall come upon every city, that not a city shall escape; and the valley shall perish, and the plateau shall be destroyed: as Jehovah hath said.
\[9]Give wings unto Moab, that she may flee and get away; and the cities thereof shall become a desolation, without inhabitant.
\[10]Cursed be he that doeth the work of Jehovah negligently, and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood!
\[11]Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and hath settled on his lees; he hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste hath remained in him, and his scent is not changed.
\[12]Therefore behold, days come, saith Jehovah, that I will send unto him pourers that shall pour him off, and shall empty his vessels, and break in pieces his flagons.
\[13]And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.
\[14]How do ye say, We are mighty, and men of valour for the war?
\[15]Moab is laid waste, and his cities are gone up [in smoke], and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.
\[16]The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.
\[17]All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod!
\[18]Come down from [thy] glory and sit in the drought, O inhabitress, daughter of Dibon; the spoiler of Moab is come up against thee, thy strongholds hath he destroyed.
\[19]Stand by the way, and watch, inhabitress of Aroer; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth; say, What is done?
\[20]Moab is put to shame; for he is broken down: howl and cry; tell it in Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.
\[21]And judgment is come upon the country of the plateau; upon Holon, and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath;
\[22]and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim;
\[23]and upon Kirjathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon;
\[24]and upon Kerijoth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near.
\[25]The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith Jehovah.
\[26]Make him drunken, for he magnified himself against Jehovah; and Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.
\[27]For was not Israel a derision unto thee? Was he found among thieves, that as oft as thou didst speak of him, thou didst shake the head?
\[28]Leave the cities, and dwell in the rocks, ye inhabitants of Moab, and be like the dove, that maketh her nest in the sides of the cave's mouth.
\[29]We have heard of the arrogance of Moab,—[he is] very proud;—his loftiness, and his arrogance, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.
\[30]I know his wrath, saith Jehovah; his pratings are vain: they do not as [they say].
\[31]Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab: for the men of Kir-heres shall there be moaning.
\[32]O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with more than the weeping of Jaazer: thy shoots passed over the sea, they reached to the sea of Jaazer. The spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.
\[33]And joy and gladness is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: they shall no more tread with shouting; the shouting shall be no shouting.
\[34]Because of the cry from Heshbon, unto Elaleh, unto Jahaz have they uttered their voice, from Zoar unto Horonaim, [unto] Eglath-shelishijah: for even the waters of Nimrim shall become desolations.
\[35]And I will cause to cease in Moab, saith Jehovah, him that offereth in the high place, and him that burneth incense to his gods.
\[36]Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and my heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir-heres; because the abundance that he hath gotten is perished.
\[37]For every head is bald, and every beard clipped; upon all the hands are cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.
\[38]It is wholly lamentation upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the public places thereof; for I have broken Moab, like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith Jehovah.
\[39]They howl, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! And Moab shall be a derision and a terror to all that are round about him.
\[40]For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread forth his wings over Moab.
\[41]Kerijoth is taken, and the strongholds are seized, and at that day the heart of the mighty men of Moab shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
\[42]And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against Jehovah.
\[43]Fear, and the pit, and the snare shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith Jehovah.
\[44]He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon her, upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith Jehovah.
\[45]They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon powerless; for a fire hath come forth from Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and hath consumed the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the sons of tumult.
\[46]Woe to thee, Moab! The people of Chemosh is undone; for thy sons are taken away in captivity, and thy daughters are captives.
\[47]But I will turn the captivity of Moab at the end of the days, saith Jehovah. Thus far is the judgement of Moab.

oncerning the children of Ammon. Thus saith Jehovah: Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? Why is Malcam heir of Gad, and his people dwell in the cities thereof?
\[2]Therefore behold, days come, saith Jehovah, that I will cause the clamour of war to be heard in Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it shall be a desolate heap; and her towns shall be burned with fire; and Israel shall possess them that possessed him, saith Jehovah.
\[3]Howl, Heshbon! for Ai is laid waste; cry, daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth, lament and run to and fro within the enclosures: for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together.
\[4]Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys? Thy valley shall flow down, O backsliding daughter, that trusteth in her treasures, [saying,] Who shall come against me?
\[5]Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord Jehovah of hosts, from all that are about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall assemble the fugitives.
\[6]And afterwards I will turn the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith Jehovah.
\[7]Concerning Edom. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Is there no more wisdom in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom spent?
\[8]Flee, turn back, dwell deep down, ye inhabitants of Dedan! For I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I visit him.
\[9]If grape-gatherers had come to thee, would they not have left a gleaning? If thieves by night, they would destroy only till they had enough.
\[10]But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, that he is unable to hide himself: his seed is wasted, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.
\[11]Leave thine orphans, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.
\[12]For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink; and thou indeed, shouldest thou be altogether unpunished? Thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink.
\[13]For I have sworn by myself, saith Jehovah, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.
\[14]I have heard a rumour from Jehovah, and an ambassador is sent among the nations:—Gather yourselves together, and come against her and rise up for the battle.
\[15]For behold, I have made thee small among the nations, despised among men.
\[16]Thy terribleness, the pride of thy heart, hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill. Though thou shouldest make thy nest high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith Jehovah.
\[17]And Edom shall be an astonishment: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss, because of all the plagues thereof.
\[18]As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, and their neighbour cities, saith Jehovah, no one shall dwell there, neither shall a son of man sojourn therein.
\[19]Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of the Jordan against the strong habitation; for I will make them suddenly run away from it; and who is a chosen [man] whom I shall appoint over her? For who is like me? and who will assign me a time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
\[20]Therefore hear the counsel of Jehovah, which he hath taken against Edom, and his purposes which he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: The little ones of the flock shall certainly draw them away; he shall certainly make their habitation desolate for them.
\[21]The earth quaketh at the sound of their fall; there is a cry, the sound whereof is heard in the Red sea.
\[22]Behold, he shall come up, and fly as an eagle, and spread forth his wings against Bozrah; and at that day the heart of the mighty men of Edom shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
\[23]Concerning Damascus. Hamath is put to shame, and Arpad; for they have heard evil tidings, they are melted away: there is distress on the sea; it cannot be quiet.
\[24]Damascus is grown feeble: she turneth herself to flee, and terror hath seized on her; trouble and sorrows have taken hold of her as of a woman in travail.
\[25]How is not the town of praise forsaken, the city of my joy!
\[26]Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all the men of war be cut off in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts.
\[27]And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-Hadad.
\[28]Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote. Thus saith Jehovah: Arise, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.
\[29]Their tents and their flocks shall they take; their curtains and all their vessels, and their camels, shall they carry away for themselves; and they shall cry unto them, Terror on every side!
\[30]Flee, wander very far, dwell deep down, ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith Jehovah; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.
\[31]Arise, get you up against the nation at ease, that dwelleth securely, saith Jehovah, which hath neither gates nor bars: they dwell alone.
\[32]And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil; and I will scatter to every wind them that have the corners [of their beard] cut off, and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith Jehovah.
\[33]And Hazor shall be a dwelling-place of jackals, a desolation for ever. No one shall dwell there, neither shall a son of man sojourn therein.
\[34]The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,
\[35]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.
\[36]And upon Elam will I bring the four winds, from the four ends of the heavens, and I will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.
\[37]And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life; and I will bring evil upon them, my fierce anger, saith Jehovah; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them.
\[38]And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence king and princes, saith Jehovah.
\[39]But it shall come to pass at the end of the days, I will turn the captivity of Elam, saith Jehovah.

he word that Jehovah spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, through Jeremiah the prophet.
\[2]Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and lift up a banner; publish, conceal not! Say, Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed: her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed.
\[3]For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: both man and beast are fled; they are gone.
\[4]In those days, and at that time, saith Jehovah, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping as they go, and shall seek Jehovah their God.
\[5]They shall inquire concerning Zion, with their faces thitherward, [saying,] Come, and let us join ourselves to Jehovah, in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten.
\[6]My people are lost sheep; their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they turned them away on the mountains: they went from mountain to hill, they forgot their resting-place.
\[7]All that found them devoured them, and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Jehovah, the habitation of righteousness, even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers.
\[8]Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flock.
\[9]For behold, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon, an assemblage of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in array against her: from thence shall she be taken. Their arrows shall be as those of a mighty expert man: none shall return empty.
\[10]And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all the spoilers thereof shall be satiated, saith Jehovah.
\[11]For ye rejoiced, for ye triumphed, ye plunderers of my heritage; for ye have been wanton as the heifer at grass, and neighed as steeds.
\[12]Your mother hath been sorely put to shame; she that bore you hath been covered with reproach: behold, [she is become] hindmost of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
\[13]Because of the wrath of Jehovah, it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate; every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and shall hiss, because of all her plagues.
\[14]Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against Jehovah.
\[15]Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand; her ramparts are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for this is the vengeance of Jehovah. Take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.
\[16]Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest. For fear of the oppressing sword let them turn every one to his people, and let them flee every one to his own land.
\[17]Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria devoured him, and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.
\[18]Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will visit the king of Babylon and his land, like as I have visited the king of Assyria.
\[19]And I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and in Gilead.
\[20]In those days, and at that time, saith Jehovah, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon those whom I leave remaining.
\[21]Go up against the land of double rebellion, against it, and against the inhabitants of visitation; waste and utterly destroy after them, saith Jehovah, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.
\[22]A sound of battle is in the land, and great destruction.
\[23]How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! How is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!
\[24]I have laid a snare for thee, and thou, Babylon, art also taken, and thou wast not aware; thou art found, and also caught, for thou hast contended with Jehovah.
\[25]Jehovah hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for this is a work for the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, in the land of the Chaldeans.
\[26]Come ye against her from every quarter, open her storehouses; pile her up like sheaves, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.
\[27]Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
\[28]The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God, the vengeance of his temple.
\[29]Call together the archers against Babylon, all those that bend the bow: encamp against her round about; let there be no escaping: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath acted proudly against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel.
\[30]Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets; and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith Jehovah.
\[31]Behold, I am against thee, proud one, saith the Lord Jehovah of hosts; for thy day is come, the time that I visit thee:
\[32]and the proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up; yea, I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all that are round about him.
\[33]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah were together oppressed; and all that took them captives held them fast: they refused to let them go.
\[34]Their Redeemer is strong; Jehovah of hosts is his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
\[35]The sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith Jehovah, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men;
\[36]the sword is upon the liars, and they shall become fools; the sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed;
\[37]the sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her, and they shall become as women; the sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed:
\[38]a drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is a land of graven images, and they are mad after frightful idols.
\[39]Therefore wild beasts of the desert with jackals shall dwell there, and ostriches shall dwell therein; and it shall be no more inhabited for ever, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
\[40]As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and their neighbour cities, saith Jehovah, no one shall dwell there, neither shall a son of man sojourn therein.
\[41]Behold, a people cometh from the north, and a great nation. And many kings shall arise from the uttermost parts of the earth.
\[42]They lay hold of bow and spear; they are cruel, and will not shew mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and they ride upon horses—set in array like a man for the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
\[43]The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands wax feeble; trouble hath taken hold of him, pangs as of a woman in travail.
\[44]Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of the Jordan against the strong habitation; for I will make him suddenly run away from it; and who is a chosen [man] whom I may appoint over her? For who is like me? and who will assign me a time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
\[45]Therefore hear the counsel of Jehovah, which he hath taken against Babylon, and his purposes which he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: The little ones of the flock shall certainly draw them away; he shall certainly make their habitation desolate for them.
\[46]At the sound of the taking of Babylon the earth hath quaked, and the cry is heard among the nations.

hus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the heart of those that rise against me, a destroying wind;
\[2]and I will send unto Babylon strangers, who shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.
\[3]Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifteth himself up in his coat of mail; and spare not her young men: destroy utterly all her host.
\[4]And the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets.
\[5]For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of Jehovah of hosts; for their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.
\[6]Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save every man his life; be ye not cut off in her iniquity: for this is the time of Jehovah's vengeance: he shall render unto her a recompence.
\[7]Babylon hath been a golden cup in Jehovah's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunk of her wine; therefore have the nations become mad.
\[8]Babylon is suddenly fallen and ruined. Howl over her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.
\[9]We have treated Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country; for her judgment reacheth unto the heavens, and is lifted up to the skies.
\[10]Jehovah hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of Jehovah our God.
\[11]Sharpen the arrows; take the shields. Jehovah hath stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes; for his purpose is against Babylon, to destroy it; for this is the vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance of his temple.
\[12]Lift up a banner towards the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set the watchmen, prepare the ambushes; for Jehovah hath both devised and done that which he spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.
\[13]Thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, the measure of thy rapacity.
\[14]Jehovah of hosts hath sworn by himself, I will assuredly fill thee with men, as with caterpillars; and they shall raise a shout against thee.
\[15]He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his understanding.
\[16]When he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the end of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
\[17]Every man is become brutish, so as to have no knowledge; every founder is put to shame by the graven image, for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
\[18]They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\[19]The portion of Jacob is not like them; for it is he that hath formed all things: and [Israel] is the rod of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name.
\[20]Thou art my maul, [my] weapons of war: and with thee I will break in pieces the nations, and I will with thee destroy kingdoms;
\[21]and with thee I will break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee I will break in pieces the chariot and its driver;
\[22]and with thee will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;
\[23]and with thee will I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces governors and rulers.
\[24]And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea, in your sight, all their evil which they have done in Zion, saith Jehovah.
\[25]Behold, I am against thee, mount of destruction, saith Jehovah, which destroyest all the earth; and I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burning mountain.
\[26]And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; for thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith Jehovah.
\[27]Lift up a banner in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare nations against her; call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the bristly caterpillars.
\[28]Prepare nations against her, the kings of the Medes, their governors and all their rulers, yea, all the land of their dominion.
\[29]And the land trembleth and is in pain; for the purposes of Jehovah against Babylon do stand, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.
\[30]The mighty men of Babylon have ceased to fight, they are sitting in the fortresses; their might hath failed, they are become as women: they have set her dwelling places on fire; her bars are broken.
\[31]Courier runneth to meet courier, and messenger to meet messenger, to announce to the king of Babylon that his city is taken from end to end;
\[32]and the passages are seized, and the reedy places are burnt with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.
\[33]For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor, at the time of its being trodden; yet a little while, and the time of harvest shall come for her.
\[34]Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel; he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out.
\[35]The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitress of Zion say; and, My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.
\[36]Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her spring dry.
\[37]And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling-place of jackals, an astonishment, and a hissing, without inhabitant.
\[38]They shall roar together like young lions, growl as lions' whelps.
\[39]When they are heated, I will prepare their drink, and I will make them drunken, that they may exult, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith Jehovah.
\[40]I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats.
\[41]How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth seized! How is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!
\[42]The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of its waves.
\[43]Her cities are become a desolation, a dry land, and a desert, a land wherein no one dwelleth, neither doth a son of man pass thereby.
\[44]And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth what he hath swallowed up; and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon is fallen.
\[45]Go ye out of the midst of her, my people, and deliver every man his soul from the fierce anger of Jehovah!
\[46]lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; for a rumour shall come [one] year, and after that a rumour in [another] year, and violence in the earth, ruler against ruler.
\[47]Therefore behold, days are coming when I will punish the graven images of Babylon; and her whole land shall be put to shame, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
\[48]And the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, shall shout aloud over Babylon; for out of the north the spoilers shall come against her, saith Jehovah.
\[49]As Babylon caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.
\[50]Ye that have escaped the sword, go, stand not still: remember Jehovah from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
\[51]—We are put to shame, for we have heard reproach; confusion hath covered our face: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of Jehovah's house.
\[52]—Therefore behold, days come, saith Jehovah, that I will punish her graven images; and throughout her land the wounded shall groan.
\[53]Though Babylon should mount up to the heavens, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith Jehovah.
\[54]The sound of a cry [cometh] from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans;
\[55]for Jehovah spoileth Babylon, and he will destroy out of her the great voice; and their waves roar like great waters, the noise of their voice resoundeth.
\[56]For the spoiler is come against her, against Babylon, and her mighty men are taken; their bows are broken in pieces; for Jehovah, the God of recompences, will certainly requite.
\[57]And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her governors, and her rulers, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.
\[58]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly laid bare, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; so that the peoples will have laboured in vain, and the nations for the fire: and they shall be weary.
\[59]The word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Nerijah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain.
\[60]And Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, all these words that are written against Babylon.
\[61]And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, see that thou read all these words;
\[62]and say, Jehovah, thou hast spoken concerning this place, that thou wilt cut it off, so that none shall dwell in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.
\[63]And it shall be, when thou hast ended reading this book, [that] thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates;
\[64]and shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise, because of the evil that I will bring upon it: and they shall be weary. Thus far the words of Jeremiah.

edekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\[2]And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
\[3]For, because the anger of Jehovah was against Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
\[4]And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, [that] Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem; and they encamped against it, and built turrets against it round about.
\[5]And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
\[6]In the fourth month, on the ninth of the month, the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
\[7]And the city was broken into: and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden (now the Chaldeans were near the city round about); and they went the way toward the plain.
\[8]And the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
\[9]And they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon, unto Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he pronounced judgment upon him.
\[10]And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; and he slaughtered also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
\[11]And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with chains of brass; and the king of Babylon carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
\[12]And in the fifth month, on the tenth of the month, which was in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzar-adan, captain of the body-guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, came unto Jerusalem;
\[13]and he burned the house of Jehovah, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; and every great [man's] house he burned with fire.
\[14]And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the body-guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
\[15]And Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard carried away captive of the poorest sort of the people, and the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the deserters that had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
\[16]But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard left of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.
\[17]And the brazen pillars that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of Jehovah, the Chaldeans broke up, and carried all the brass thereof to Babylon.
\[18]The pots also, and the shovels, and the knives, and the bowls, and the cups, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, they took away.
\[19]And the basons and the censers, and the bowls, and the pots, and the candlesticks, and the cups, and the goblets, that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, the captain of the body-guard took away.
\[20]The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brazen oxen that formed the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah: for the brass of all these vessels there was no weight.
\[21]And as to the pillars: the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a line of twelve cubits encompassed it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.
\[22]And the capital upon it was brass, and the height of the one capital [was] five cubits; and the network and the pomegranates, upon the capital round about, all of brass; and similarly for the second pillar, and the pomegranates.
\[23]And there were ninety-six pomegranates on the [four] sides; all the pomegranates upon the network were a hundred round about.
\[24]And the captain of the body-guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.
\[25]And out of the city he took a eunuch that was set over the men of war, and seven men of them that were in the king's presence, who were found in the city, and the scribe of the captain of the host, who enrolled the people of the land. And sixty men of the people of the land that were found in the midst of the city.
\[26]And Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah;
\[27]and the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his land.
\[28]This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand and twenty-three Jews;
\[29]in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar [he carried away captive] from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons;
\[30]in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred and forty-five persons: all the persons were four thousand six hundred.
\[31]And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth of the month, [that] Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison;
\[32]and he spoke kindly unto him, and set his seat above the seat of the kings that were with him in Babylon.
\[33]And he changed his prison garments; and he ate bread before him continually all the days of his life;
\[34]and his allowance was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.

ow doth the city sit solitary [that] was full of people! She that was great among the nations is become as a widow; the princess among the provinces is become tributary!
\[2]She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; among all her lovers she hath no comforter; all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.
\[3]Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude; she dwelleth among the nations, she findeth no rest: all her pursuers have overtaken her within the straits.
\[4]The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly: all her gates are desolate; her priests sigh, her virgins are in grief; and as for her, she is in bitterness.

\[6]And from the daughter of Zion all her splendour is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture; and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.
\[7]In the days of her affliction and of her wanderings, since her people fell into the hand of an adversary, and none did help her, Jerusalem remembereth all her precious things which she had in the days of old: the adversaries have seen her, they mock at her ruin.
\[8]Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore is she removed as an impurity: all that honoured her despise her because they have seen her nakedness; and she sigheth, and turneth backward.
\[9]Her impurity was in her skirts, she remembered not her latter end; and she came down wonderfully: she hath no comforter. Jehovah, behold my affliction; for the enemy hath magnified himself.
\[10]The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her precious things; for she hath seen the nations enter into her sanctuary, concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.
\[11]All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their precious things for food to revive [their] soul. See, Jehovah, and consider, for I am become vile.
\[12]Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, whom Jehovah hath afflicted in the day of his fierce anger.
\[13]From on high hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them; he hath spread a net for my feet; he hath turned me back; he hath made me desolate [and] faint all the day.
\[14]The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, they are come up upon my neck; he hath made my strength to fail; the Lord hath delivered me into hands out of which I am not able to rise up.
\[15]The Lord hath cast down all my mighty men in the midst of me; he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men; the Lord hath trodden as a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah.
\[16]For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water: for the comforter that should revive my soul is far from me; my children are desolate, for the enemy hath prevailed.
\[17]Zion spreadeth forth her hands; there is none to comfort her; Jehovah hath commanded concerning Jacob, [that] his adversaries [should be] round about him; Jerusalem is as an impurity among them.
\[18]Jehovah is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment. Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow. My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
\[19]I called for my lovers, they have deceived me; my priests and mine elders have expired in the city, while they sought them food to revive their soul.
\[20]See, Jehovah, for I am in distress, my bowels are troubled; my heart is turned within me, for I have grievously rebelled: without, the sword hath bereaved [me], within, it is as death.
\[21]They have heard that I sigh: I have no comforter: all mine enemies have heard of my calamity; they are glad that thou hast done it. Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.
\[22]Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.

ow hath the Lord in his anger covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud! He hath cast down from the heavens unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger.
\[2]The Lord hath swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob, and hath not spared; he hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah: he hath brought [them] down to the ground; he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof.
\[3]He hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath withdrawn his right hand from before the enemy; and he burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, devouring round about.
\[4]He hath bent his bow like an enemy; he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and hath slain all that was pleasant to the eye: in the tent of the daughter of Zion, he hath poured out his fury like fire.
\[5]The Lord is become as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel; he hath swallowed up all her palaces; he hath destroyed his strongholds, and hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
\[6]And he hath violently cast down his enclosure as a garden; he hath destroyed his place of assembly: Jehovah hath caused set feast and sabbath to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger king and priest.
\[7]The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath rejected his sanctuary; he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces: they have made a noise in the house of Jehovah, as on the day of a set feast.
\[8]Jehovah hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out the line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying; and he hath made the rampart and the wall to lament: they languish together.
\[9]Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars. Her king and her princes are among the nations: the law is no [more]; her prophets also find no vision from Jehovah.
\[10]The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, they keep silence; they have cast dust upon their heads, they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their head to the ground.
\[11]Mine eyes are consumed with tears, my bowels are troubled; my liver is poured upon the earth, because of the ruin of the daughter of my people; because infant and suckling swoon in the streets of the city.
\[12]They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city; when they pour out their soul into their mothers' bosom.
\[13]What shall I take to witness for thee? what shall I liken unto thee, daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, virgin daughter of Zion? For thy ruin is great as the sea: who will heal thee?
\[14]Thy prophets have seen vanity and folly for thee; and they have not revealed thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee burdens of falsehood and causes of expulsion.
\[15]All that pass by clap [their] hands at thee; they hiss and shake their head at the daughter of Jerusalem: Is this the city which they called, The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?
\[16]All thine enemies open their mouth against thee, they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed [her] up; this is forsooth the day that we looked for: we have found, we have seen [it].
\[17]Jehovah hath done what he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word which he had commanded from the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not spared, and he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee; he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.
\[18]Their heart cried unto the Lord. O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a torrent day and night: give thyself no respite; let not the apple of thine eye rest.
\[19]Arise, cry out in the night, in the beginning of the watches; pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, who faint from hunger at the top of all the streets.
\[20]See, Jehovah, and consider to whom thou hast done this! Shall the women eat their fruit, the infants that they nursed? Shall priest and prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?
\[21]The child and the old man lie on the ground in the streets; my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword: thou hast slain [them] in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, thou hast not spared.
\[22]Thou hast called up, as on the day of a set feast, my terrors on every side; and in the day of Jehovah's anger there was none that escaped or remained: those that I have nursed and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.

\[3]Surely against me hath he turned again and again his hand all the day.
\[4]My flesh and my skin hath he wasted away, he hath broken my bones.
\[5]He hath built against me, and encompassed [me] with gall and toil.
\[6]He hath made me to dwell in dark places as those that have been long dead.
\[7]He hath hedged me about that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.
\[8]Even when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.
\[9]He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.
\[10]He is unto me [as] a bear lying in wait, a lion in secret places.
\[11]He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he hath made me desolate.
\[12]He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
\[13]He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.
\[14]I am become a derision to all my people; their song all the day.
\[15]He hath sated me with bitterness, he hath made me drunk with wormwood.
\[16]He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.
\[17]And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I have forgotten prosperity.
\[18]And I said, My strength is perished, and my hope in Jehovah.
\[19]Remember thou mine affliction and my wandering, the wormwood and the gall.
\[20]My soul hath [them] constantly in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
\[21]—This I recall to heart, therefore have I hope.
\[22]It is of Jehovah's loving-kindness we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not;
\[23]they are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.
\[24]Jehovah is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
\[25]Jehovah is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul [that] seeketh him.
\[26]It is good that one should both wait, and that in silence, for the salvation of Jehovah.
\[27]It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth:
\[28]He sitteth solitary and keepeth silence, because he hath laid it upon him;
\[29]he putteth his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope;
\[30]he giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him; he is filled full with reproach.
\[31]For the Lord will not cast off for ever;
\[32]but if he have caused grief, he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses:
\[33]for he doth not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men.
\[34]To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,
\[35]to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,
\[36]to wrong a man in his cause,—will not the Lord see it?
\[37]Who is he that saith, and there cometh to pass, what the Lord hath not commanded?
\[38]Out of the mouth of the Most High doth not there proceed evil and good?
\[39]Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?
\[40]Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Jehovah.
\[41]Let us lift up our heart with [our] hands unto God in the heavens.
\[42]We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.
\[43]Thou hast covered thyself with anger, and pursued us; thou hast slain, thou hast not spared.
\[44]Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that prayer should not pass through.
\[45]Thou hast made us the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.
\[46]All our enemies have opened their mouth against us.
\[47]Fear and the pit are come upon us, devastation and ruin.
\[48]Mine eye runneth down with streams of water for the ruin of the daughter of my people.
\[49]Mine eye poureth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
\[50]till Jehovah look down and behold from the heavens.
\[51]Mine eye affecteth my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.
\[52]They that are mine enemies without cause have chased me sore like a bird.
\[53]They have cut off my life in a pit, and cast a stone upon me.
\[54]Waters streamed over my head; I said, I am cut off.
\[55]I called upon thy name, Jehovah, out of the lowest pit.
\[56]Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my sighing, at my cry.
\[57]Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee; thou saidst, Fear not.
\[58]Lord, thou hast pleaded the cause of my soul, thou hast redeemed my life.

\[3]Even the jackals offer the breast, they give suck to their young; the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
\[4]The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst; the young children ask bread, no man breaketh it unto them.
\[5]They that fed delicately are desolate in the streets; they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dung-hills.
\[6]And the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the reward of the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were violently laid upon her.
\[7]Her Nazarites were purer than snow, whiter than milk; they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their figure was as sapphire.
\[8]Their visage is darker than blackness, they are not known in the streets; their skin cleaveth to their bones, it is withered, it is become like a stick.
\[9]The slain with the sword are happier than the slain with hunger; for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field.

\[15]They cried unto them, Depart! Unclean! Depart! depart, touch not! When they fled away, and wandered about, it was said among the nations, They shall no more sojourn [there].
\[16]The face of Jehovah hath divided them; he will no more regard them. They respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the aged.
\[17]Our eyes still failed for our vain help; in our watching, we have watched for a nation that did not save.
\[18]They hunted our steps, that we could not go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.
\[19]Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens; they chased us hotly upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.
\[20]The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was taken in their pits; of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.
\[21]Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz: the cup shall pass also unto thee; thou shalt be drunken, and make thyself naked.

ow it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], on the fifth of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
\[2]On the fifth of the month, (it was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,)
\[3]the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him.
\[4]And I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the look of glowing brass, out of the midst of the fire.
\[5]Also out of the midst thereof, the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.
\[6]And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.
\[7]And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled as the look of burnished brass.
\[8]And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings:
\[9]their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.
\[10]And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.
\[11]And their faces and their wings were parted above; two [wings] of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
\[12]And they went every one straight forward: whither the Spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.
\[13]And as for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, as the appearance of torches: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright; and out of the fire went forth lightning.
\[14]And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
\[15]And I looked at the living creatures, and behold, one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, toward their four faces.
\[16]The appearance of the wheels and their work was as the look of a chrysolite; and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
\[17]When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not when they went.
\[18]As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about.
\[19]And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
\[20]Whithersoever the Spirit was to go, they went, thither would [their] spirit go; and the wheels were lifted up along with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\[21]When those went, they went; and when those stood, they stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up along with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\[22]And there was the likeness of an expanse over the heads of the living creature, as the look of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.
\[23]And under the expanse were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side their bodies.
\[24]And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, a tumultuous noise, as the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings;
\[25]and there was a voice from above the expanse that was over their heads. When they stood, they let down their wings.
\[26]And above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.
\[27]And I saw as the look of glowing brass, as the appearance of fire, within it round about; from the appearance of his loins and upward, and from the appearance of his loins and downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.
\[28]As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.

\[4]and these children are impudent and hard-hearted: I am sending thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah.

\[4]And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.
\[5]For thou art not sent to a people of strange language, and of difficult speech, [but] to the house of Israel;
\[6]not to many peoples of strange language and of difficult speech, whose words thou canst not understand: had I sent thee to them, would they not hearken unto thee?
\[7]But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee, for none of them will hearken unto me. For all the house of Israel are hard of forehead and stiff of heart.
\[8]Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.
\[9]As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead. Fear them not, neither be dismayed at them, for they are a rebellious house.

\[13]—and the sound of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, and the sound of a great rushing.
\[14]And the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.
\[15]And I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and I sat where they sat; and I sat there astonied among them seven days.
\[16]And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
\[17]Son of man, I have appointed thee a watchman unto the house of Israel, and thou shalt hear the word from my mouth, and give them warning from me.
\[18]When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt certainly die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, that he may live: the same wicked [man] shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
\[19]But if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
\[20]And when a righteous [man] doth turn from his righteousness, and do what is wrong, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die; because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous acts which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
\[21]And if thou warn the righteous [man], that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall certainly live, for he hath taken warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.
\[22]And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the valley, and there I will talk with thee.
\[23]And I arose, and went forth into the valley, and behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.
\[24]And the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.
\[25]And thou, son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee therewith, and thou shalt not go out among them.
\[26]And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.
\[27]And when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.

\[8]therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations;

\[10]Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter to all the winds.
\[11]Wherefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, verily because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also withdraw mine eye, and it shall not spare, nor will I have any pity.
\[12]A third part of thee shall die by the pestilence, and shall be consumed by the famine in the midst of thee; and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part to all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.
\[13]And mine anger shall be accomplished, and I will satisfy my fury upon them, and I will comfort myself; and they shall know that I Jehovah have spoken in my jealousy, when I have accomplished my fury upon them.
\[14]And I will make thee a waste and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.
\[15]And it shall be a reproach, and a taunt, an instruction, and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments upon thee in anger, and in fury, and in furious rebukes: I, Jehovah, have spoken.
\[16]When I send upon them the evil arrows of famine, that are for [their] destruction, which I send to destroy you, then will I increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread.

\[3]And he stretched forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heavens, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entry of the inner gate that looketh toward the north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.

\[6]And he said unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? the great abominations that the house of Israel commit here, to cause [me] to go far off from my sanctuary? And yet again thou shalt see great abominations.
\[7]And he brought me to the entry of the court, and I looked, and behold, a hole in the wall.

\[14]And I will break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered [mortar], and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered; and it shall fall, and ye shall be destroyed in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.
\[15]And I will accomplish my fury upon the wall, and upon them that daub it with untempered [mortar], and will say unto you, The wall is no [more], neither they that daubed it,
\[16]the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see a vision of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[17]And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, who prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy against them,
\[18]and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe unto the women that sew pillows for all wrists, and that make veils for the head [of persons] of every stature to catch souls! Will ye catch the souls of my people, and will ye save your own souls alive?
\[19]And will ye profane me among my people for handfuls of barley and for morsels of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that listen to lying?
\[20]Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against your pillows, that the souls which ye catch by their means may fly away; and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, the souls that ye catch, that they may fly away.
\[21]And I will tear your veils and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.
\[22]Because with falsehood ye have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and have strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, to save his life:
\[23]therefore ye shall no more see vanity, nor divine divinations; and I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.

\[2]And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
\[3]Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?
\[4]Therefore speak to them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet, I Jehovah will answer him according to this, according to the multitude of his idols:
\[5]that I may take the house of Israel by their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
\[6]Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Return ye, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
\[7]For every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, who separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet to inquire of me by him, I Jehovah will answer him by myself;
\[8]and I will set my face against that man, and will make him desolate, [so that he shall be] for a sign and for proverbs, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people: and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.
\[9]And if the prophet be enticed and shall speak a word, I Jehovah have enticed that prophet; and I will stretch out my hand against him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
\[10]And they shall bear their iniquity: the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of the inquirer;
\[11]that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither make themselves any more unclean with all their transgressions; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[12]And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
\[13]Son of man, when a land sinneth against me by working unfaithfulness, and I stretch out my hand upon it, and break the staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and cut off man and beast from it;
\[14]though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, should be in it, they should deliver [but] their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[15]If I cause evil beasts to pass through the land, and they bereave it, and it become a desolation, so that no one passeth through because of the beasts;
\[16]—though these three men should be in it, [as] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters: they only should be delivered, and the land should be a desolation.
\[17]Or [if] I bring the sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land, so that I cut off man and beast from it,
\[18]and these three men should be in it, [as] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only themselves should be delivered.
\[19]Or [if] I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast,
\[20]and Noah, Daniel, and Job should be in it, [as] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither son nor daughter: they should [but] deliver their own souls by their righteousness.
\[21]For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the evil beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast!
\[22]But behold, there shall be left in it those that escape, who shall be brought out of [it], sons and daughters. Behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings; and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, as to all that I have brought upon it.
\[23]And they shall comfort you, when ye see their way and their doings; and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord Jehovah.

\[2]Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,
\[3]and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto Jerusalem: Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of the Canaanite: thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite.
\[4]And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water for cleansing; thou wast not rubbed with salt at all, nor swaddled at all.
\[5]No eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, from abhorrence of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.
\[6]And I passed by thee, and saw thee weltering in thy blood, and I said unto thee, in thy blood, Live! yea, I said unto thee, in thy blood, Live!
\[7]I caused thee to multiply, as the bud of the field; and thou didst increase and grow great, and thou camest to fulness of beauty; [thy] breasts were fashioned, and thy hair grew: but thou wast naked and bare.
\[8]And I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, and behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness; and I swore unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord Jehovah, and thou becamest mine.
\[9]And I washed thee with water, and thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil;
\[10]and I clothed thee with embroidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I bound thee about with byssus, and covered thee with silk.
\[11]And I decked thee with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck;
\[12]and I put a ring on thy nose, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.
\[13]Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver, and thy raiment was byssus, and silk, and embroidered work. Thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil; and thou becamest exceedingly beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.
\[14]And thy fame went forth among the nations for thy beauty; for it was perfect through my magnificence, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[15]But thou didst confide in thy beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy whoredoms on every one that passed by: his it was.
\[16]And of thy garments thou didst take, and madest for thyself high places decked with divers colours, and didst play the harlot thereupon: [the like] hath not come to pass, and shall be no more.
\[17]And thou didst take thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of males, and didst commit fornication with them.
\[18]And thou tookest thine embroidered garments, and coveredst them; and thou didst set mine oil and mine incense before them.
\[19]And my bread which I had given thee, the fine flour and the oil and the honey wherewith I fed thee, thou didst even set it before them for a sweet savour: thus it was, saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[20]And thou didst take thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hadst borne unto me, and these didst thou sacrifice unto them, to be devoured. Were thy whoredoms a small matter,
\[21]that thou didst slay my children and give them up in passing them over to them?
\[22]And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, when thou wast weltering in thy blood.
\[23]And it came to pass after all thy wickedness (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord Jehovah),
\[24]that thou didst also build unto thee a place of debauchery, and didst make thee a high place in every street:
\[25]thou didst build thy high place at every head of the way, and madest thy beauty to be abhorred, and thou didst open thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiply thy whoredom.
\[26]And thou didst commit fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and didst multiply thy whoredom to provoke me to anger.
\[27]And behold, I stretched out my hand over thee, and diminished thine appointed portion; and I gave thee over unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, who were confounded at thy lewd way.
\[28]And thou didst commit fornication with the Assyrians, because thou wast insatiable; yea, thou didst commit fornication with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.
\[29]And thou didst multiply thy whoredom with the land of merchants, Chaldea, and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.
\[30]How weak is thy heart, saith the Lord Jehovah, seeing thou doest all these [things], the work of a whorish woman, under no restraint;
\[31]in that thou buildest thy place of debauchery at the head of every way, and makest thy high place in every street! And thou hast not been as a harlot, in that thou scornest reward,
\[32]O adulterous wife, that taketh strangers instead of her husband.
\[33]They give rewards to all harlots; but thou gavest thy rewards to all thy lovers, and rewardedst them, that they might come unto thee on every side for thy whoredoms.
\[34]And in thee is the contrary from [other] women, in thy whoredoms, in that none followeth thee to commit fornication; and whereas thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, so art thou contrary.
\[35]Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah.
\[36]Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thy money hath been poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy fornications with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thine abominations, and because of the blood of thy children which thou didst give unto them;
\[37]therefore, behold, I will gather all thy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all that thou hast loved, with all that thou hast hated,—I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.
\[38]And I will judge thee with the judgments of women that commit adultery and shed blood; and I will give thee up to the blood of fury and jealousy;
\[39]and I will give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thy place of debauchery, and shall break down thy high places; and they shall strip thee of thy garments, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.
\[40]And they shall bring up an assemblage against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.
\[41]And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will cause thee to cease from being a harlot, and thou also shalt give no more any reward.
\[42]And I will appease my fury against thee, and my jealousy shall depart from thee; and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.
\[43]Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast raged against me in all these [things], behold, therefore, I also will recompense thy way upon [thy] head, saith the Lord Jehovah, and thou shalt not commit this lewdness besides all thine abominations.
\[44]Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall speak in a proverb against thee, saying, As the mother, [so is] her daughter!
\[45]Thou art the daughter of thy mother that loathed her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
\[46]And thine elder sister is Samaria that dwelleth at thy left hand, she and her daughters; and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.
\[47]And thou hast not walked in their ways, nor done according to their abominations; but as though that were a very little, thou hast been more corrupt than they in all thy ways.
\[48][As] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters!
\[49]Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, fulness of bread, and careless ease was in her and in her daughters, but she did not strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
\[50]And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me, and I took them away when I saw [it].
\[51]And Samaria hath not sinned according to the half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou hast done.
\[52]Thou also, who hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own confusion, because of thy sins in which thou hast acted more abominably than they: they are more righteous than thou. So be thou ashamed also, and bear thy confusion, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.
\[53]And I will bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them;
\[54]that thou mayest bear thy confusion, and mayest be confounded for all that thou hast done, in that thou comfortest them.
\[55]And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate; thou also and thy daughters, ye shall return to your former estate.
\[56]Yea, Sodom thy sister was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,
\[57]before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, who despise thee on every side.
\[58]Thy lewdness and thine abominations, thou bearest them, saith Jehovah.
\[59]For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath, and broken the covenant.
\[60]Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.
\[61]And thou shalt remember thy ways, and be confounded, when thou shalt receive thy sisters who are older than thou, together with those who are younger than thou; for I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by virtue of thy covenant.
\[62]And I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I [am] Jehovah;
\[63]that thou mayest remember, and be ashamed, and no more open thy mouth because of thy confusion, when I forgive thee all that thou hast done, saith the Lord Jehovah.

\[2]Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel,
\[3]and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A great eagle with great wings, long-pinioned, full of feathers, which was of divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar.
\[4]He cropped off the top of its young shoots, and carried it into a merchants' land; he set it in a city of traders.
\[5]And he took of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, he set it as a willow tree.
\[6]And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, so that its branches should turn toward him, and the roots thereof be under him; and it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.
\[7]And there was another great eagle with great wings and many feathers; and behold, from the beds of her plantation, this vine did bend her roots unto him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it.
\[8]It was planted in a good field by many waters, that it might bring forth branches and bear fruit, that it might be a noble vine.
\[9]Say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Shall it prosper? Shall he not pull up its roots, and cut off its fruit, that it may wither? All its fresh sprouting leaves shall wither, even without a great arm and many people to pluck it up by its roots.
\[10]And behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither when the east wind toucheth it? It shall wither in the beds where it grew.
\[11]And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
\[12]Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things are? Say, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took its king and its princes, and led them with him to Babylon.
\[13]And he took of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and brought him under an oath, and he took away the mighty of the land;
\[14]that the kingdom might be abased, that it might not lift itself up, that it might keep his covenant in order to stand.
\[15]But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? shall he break the covenant, and yet escape?
\[16][As] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, verily in the place of the king that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him, in the midst of Babylon, shall he die.
\[17]Neither shall Pharaoh with a mighty army and a great assemblage do anything for him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts to cut off many persons.
\[18]He despised the oath, and broke the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, yet hath he done all these things: he shall not escape.
\[19]Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: [As] I live, verily, mine oath which he hath despised, and my covenant which he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his head.
\[20]And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his unfaithfulness in which he hath been unfaithful against me.
\[21]And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward every wind; and ye shall know that I Jehovah have spoken.
\[22]Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also take of the highest branch of the lofty cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of its young shoots a tender one, and I will plant it upon a high and eminent mountain:
\[23]upon the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it; and it shall bring forth branches, and bear fruit, and become a noble cedar; and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.
\[24]And all the trees of the field shall know that I Jehovah have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and made the dry tree to flourish: I Jehovah have spoken, and will do [it].

\[4]Behold, all the souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.
\[5]And if a man be righteous, and do judgment and justice:
\[6]—he hath not eaten upon the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife, nor come near to a woman in her separation,
\[7]and hath not oppressed any; he hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath not exercised robbery, hath given his bread to the hungry, and covered the naked with a garment;
\[8]he hath not given forth upon usury, nor taken increase; he hath withdrawn his hand from unrighteousness, hath executed true judgment between man and man,
\[9]hath walked in my statutes, and kept mine ordinances, to deal faithfully: he is righteous, he shall certainly live, saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[10]And if he have begotten a son that is violent, a shedder of blood, and that doeth only one of any of these [things],
\[11]and that doeth not any of those [duties], but also hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,

\[13]given forth upon usury, and taken increase; shall he then live? He shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall certainly die; his blood shall be upon him.
\[14]But lo, if he have begotten a son that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like:
\[15]—he hath not eaten upon the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel; he hath not defiled his neighbour's wife,
\[16]and hath not oppressed any, nor withholden the pledge, neither hath exercised robbery; he hath given his bread to the hungry, and covered the naked with a garment;
\[17]he hath withdrawn his hand from the poor, hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, [and] walked in my statutes: he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall certainly live.
\[18]As for his father, because he practised oppression, exercised robbery upon his brother, and did what was not good among his people, behold, he shall die in his iniquity.
\[19]And ye say, Why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? But the son hath done judgment and justice, hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them; he shall certainly live.
\[20]The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
\[21]And the wicked, if he turn from all his sins which he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do judgment and justice, he shall certainly live, he shall not die.
\[22]None of his transgressions which he hath committed shall be remembered against him; in his righteousness which he hath done shall he live.
\[23]Have I any pleasure at all in the death of the wicked? saith the Lord Jehovah; is it not in his turning from his way, that he may live?
\[24]And when the righteous turneth from his righteousness and practiseth what is wrong, [and] doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked doeth, shall he live? None of his righteous acts which he hath done shall be remembered: in his unfaithfulness which he hath wrought, and in his sin which he hath sinned, in them shall he die.
\[25]And ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear then, house of Israel. Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?
\[26]When the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and practiseth what is wrong, and dieth for it; in his wrong that he hath done shall he die.
\[27]And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness which he hath committed, and doeth judgment and justice, he shall keep his soul alive.
\[28]Because he considereth, and turneth from all his transgressions which he hath committed, he shall certainly live, he shall not die.
\[29]But the house of Israel say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? Is it not your ways that are unequal?
\[30]Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord Jehovah. Return ye, and turn from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your snare.
\[31]Cast away from you all your transgressions wherewith ye have transgressed, and make you a new heart and a new spirit: why then will ye die, house of Israel?

\[13]But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they rejected mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned: and I said I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
\[14]But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.
\[15]And I also lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land that I had given [them], flowing with milk and honey, which is the ornament of all lands;
\[16]because they rejected mine ordinances and walked not in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.
\[17]But mine eye spared them so as not to destroy them, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness.
\[18]And I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk not in the statutes of your fathers, neither keep their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols.
\[19]I [am] Jehovah your God: walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them;
\[20]and hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I [am] Jehovah your God.
\[21]And the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept mine ordinances to do them, which if a man do, he shall live by them; they profaned my sabbaths: and I said I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish mine anger against them in the wilderness.
\[22]But I withdrew my hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.
\[23]I lifted up my hand also unto them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries;
\[24]because they performed not mine ordinances, and rejected my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.
\[25]And I also gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances whereby they should not live;
\[26]and I defiled them by their own gifts, in that they devoted all that opened the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I [am] Jehovah.
\[27]Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me, in that they have wrought unfaithfulness against me.
\[28]When I had brought them into the land which I had lifted up my hand to give unto them, then they saw every high hill and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering; and there they placed their sweet savour, and there poured out their drink-offerings.
\[29]And I said unto them, What is the high place whither ye go? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.
\[30]Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Do ye defile yourselves after the manner of your fathers? and do ye commit fornication after their abominations?
\[31]And when ye offer your gifts, making your sons to pass through the fire, ye defile yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day; and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? [As] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.
\[32]And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, in serving wood and stone.
\[33][As] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, verily with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, will I reign over you.
\[34]And I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out;
\[35]and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face.
\[36]Like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment with you, saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[37]And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
\[38]And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me; I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.
\[39]As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Go ye, serve every one his idols henceforth also, if none of you will hearken unto me; but profane my holy name no more with your gifts and with your idols.
\[40]For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, there shall all the house of Israel serve me, the whole of it, in the land; there will I accept them, and there will I require your heave-offerings and the first-fruits of your offerings, with all your holy things.
\[41]As a sweet savour will I accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be hallowed in you in the sight of the nations.
\[42]And ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah, when I have brought you into the land of Israel, into the country which I lifted up my hand to give to your fathers.
\[43]And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils which ye have committed.
\[44]And ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah, when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[45]And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
\[46]Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop [words] against the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;
\[47]and say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of Jehovah. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flashing flame shall not be quenched; and all that it meets from the south to the north shall be burned thereby.
\[48]And all flesh shall see that I Jehovah have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.

\[4]Seeing that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh, from the south to the north;
\[5]and all flesh shall know that I Jehovah have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath: it shall not return any more.
\[6]Sigh then, thou son of man; with breaking of the loins, and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.
\[7]And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore dost thou sigh? that thou shalt say, Because of the tidings, for it cometh; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall languish, and all knees shall melt into water: behold, it cometh; it is here, saith the Lord Jehovah.

\[9]Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah: Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished.
\[10]It is sharpened for sore slaughter, it is furbished that it may glitter. Shall we then make mirth, [saying,] The sceptre of my son contemneth all wood?
\[11]And he hath given it to be furbished that it may be handled. The sword,—it is sharpened, and it is furbished to give it into the hand of the slayer.
\[12]Cry and howl, son of man; for it shall be against my people, it shall be against all the princes of Israel: they are given up to the sword along with my people: smite therefore upon the thigh.
\[13]For the trial [is made]; and what if even the contemning sceptre shall be no [more]? saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[14]And thou, son of man, prophesy, and smite thy hands together; for [the strokes of] the sword shall be doubled the third time: it is the sword of the slain, the sword that hath slain the great one, which encompasseth them privily.
\[15]In order that the heart may melt, and the stumbling-blocks be multiplied, I have set the threatening sword against all their gates: ah! it is made glittering, it is whetted for the slaughter.
\[16]Gather up [strength], go to the right hand, turn thee, go to the left, whithersoever thy face is appointed.
\[17]And I myself will smite my hands together, and I will satisfy my fury: I Jehovah have spoken [it].
\[18]And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
\[19]And thou, son of man, set thee two ways, by which the sword of the king of Babylon may come—out of one land shall they both come—and make thee a signpost, make it at the head of the way to the city.
\[20]Appoint a way for the coming of the sword to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah at the fenced [city] of Jerusalem.
\[21]For the king of Babylon standeth at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shaketh [his] arrows, he inquireth of the teraphim, he looketh in the liver.
\[22]In his right hand is the lot of Jerusalem to appoint battering-rams, to open the mouth for bloodshed, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering-rams against the gates, to cast mounds, to build siege-towers.
\[23]And this shall be a false divination in their sight, for them that have sworn oaths; but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.
\[24]Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye make your iniquity to be remembered in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear; because ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.
\[25]And thou, profane, wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, at the time of the iniquity of the end,
\[26]—thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Remove the mitre and take off the crown; what is shall be no [more]. Exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.
\[27]I will overturn, overturn, overturn it! This also shall be no [more], until he come whose right it is; and I will give it [to him].
\[28]And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus speaketh the Lord Jehovah concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and thou shalt say, A sword, a sword is drawn; for the slaughter is it furbished, that it may consume, that it may glitter:
\[29]whilst they see vanity for thee, whilst they divine a lie unto thee, to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked that are slain, whose day is come at the time of the iniquity of the end.
\[30]Restore [it] to its sheath. I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy birth.
\[31]And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow upon thee the fire of my wrath, and give thee into the hand of brutish men, skilful to destroy.

\[4]Thou art become guilty by thy blood which thou hast shed, and hast defiled thyself with thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the nations, and a mocking unto all countries.
\[5]Those that are near, and those that are far from thee, shall mock thee, who art infamous [and] full of tumult.
\[6]Behold, the princes of Israel have been in thee to shed blood, each according to his power.
\[7]In thee have they made light of father and mother; in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger; in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.
\[8]Thou hast despised my holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.
\[9]In thee there have been slanderous men to shed blood; and in thee have they eaten upon the mountains; in the midst of thee they have committed lewdness;
\[10]in thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness; in thee have they humbled her that was unclean in her separation.
\[11]And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.

\[21]Yea, I will collect you, and blow upon you the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.
\[22]As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I Jehovah have poured out my fury upon you.

\[29]The people of the land use oppression and practise robbery; and they vex the poor and needy, and oppress the stranger wrongfully.

\[2]Son of man, there were two women, daughters of one mother.
\[3]And they committed whoredom in Egypt; they committed whoredom in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there were handled the teats of their virginity.
\[4]And their names were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister; and they were mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names: Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.
\[5]And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she lusted after her lovers, after the Assyrians [her] neighbours,
\[6]clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them attractive young men, horsemen riding upon horses.
\[7]And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, all of them the choice of the children of Asshur; and with all after whom she lusted, with all their idols she defiled herself.
\[8]Neither left she her whoredoms [brought] from Egypt; for in her youth they had lain with her, and had handled the breasts of her virginity, and poured their fornication upon her.
\[9]Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the children of Asshur, after whom she lusted.
\[10]These discovered her nakedness, they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword; and she became a name among women; and they executed judgment upon her.
\[11]And her sister Oholibah saw [this], and was more corrupt in her passion than she, and in her fornications more than the whoredoms of her sister.
\[12]She lusted after the children of Asshur [her] neighbours, governors and rulers, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them attractive young men.
\[13]And I saw that she was defiled: both took one way.
\[14]And she increased her fornications; for she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,
\[15]girded with girdles upon their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them captains in appearance, [after] the likeness of the children of Babylon, of Chaldea, the land of their nativity.
\[16]And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she lusted after them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.
\[17]And the children of Babylon came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their fornication; she too defiled herself with them, and her soul was alienated from them.
\[18]And she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness; and my soul was alienated from her, like as my soul was alienated from her sister.
\[19]Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she played the harlot in the land of Egypt;
\[20]and she lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is [as] the flesh of asses, and whose issue is [as] the issue of horses.
\[21]And thou didst look back to the lewdness of thy youth, in the handling of thy teats by the Egyptians, for the breasts of thy youth.
\[22]Therefore, Oholibah, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side.
\[23]The children of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, all the children of Asshur with them; all of them attractive young men, governors and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.
\[24]And they shall come against thee [with] armour, chariots and wheels, and with an assemblage of peoples; they shall set themselves against thee [with] target, and shield, and helmet round about; and I will put judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.
\[25]And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall cut off thy nose and thine ears, and thy remnant shall fall by the sword; they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.
\[26]They shall also strip the of thy garments, and take away thy fair jewels.
\[27]And I will make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom [brought] from the land of Egypt; and thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.
\[28]For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give thee over into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy soul is alienated.
\[29]And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare; so that the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy fornications.
\[30]These things shall be done unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the nations, because thou hast defiled thyself with their idols.
\[31]Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; and I have given her cup into thy hand.
\[32]Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large; thou shalt be for a laughing-stock and a derision, [for] it containeth much.
\[33]Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, the cup of thy sister Samaria;
\[34]thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt gnaw the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken [it], saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[35]Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy fornications.
\[36]And Jehovah said unto me, Son of man, wilt thou judge Oholah and Oholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations.
\[37]For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also passed over unto them their children, whom they bore unto me, to be devoured.
\[38]Moreover this have they done unto me: in the same day have they defiled my sanctuary and profaned my sabbaths.
\[39]For when they had slaughtered their children unto their idols, they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and behold, thus have they done in the midst of my house.
\[40]And furthermore, they sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and behold, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thine eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments;
\[41]and satest upon a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hadst set mine incense and mine oil.
\[42]And the voice of a multitude living carelessly was with her; and with people of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, and they put bracelets upon their hands, and a beautiful crown upon their heads.
\[43]And I said of her that was old in adulteries, Will she now commit her fornications, even she.
\[44]And they went in unto her, as they go in unto a whorish woman: so went they in unto Oholah and unto Oholibah the lewd women.
\[45]And righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women that shed blood; for they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.
\[46]For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will bring up an assemblage against them, and will give them to be driven hither and thither and spoiled.
\[47]And the assemblage shall stone them with stones, and despatch them with their swords; they shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn their houses with fire.
\[48]And I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, and all women shall receive instruction and shall not do according to your lewdness.
\[49]And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols; and ye shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.

\[3]And propose a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Set on the pot, set [it] on, and also pour water into it.
\[4]Gather the pieces thereof into it, every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder; fill [it] with the choice bones:
\[5]take the choice of the flock; and also [put] a pile of wood under it, for the bones; make it boil well, and let the bones of it seethe therein.
\[6]Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose rust is therein, and whose rust is not gone out of it! Bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it:
\[7]for her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the bare rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust.
\[8]That it might cause fury to come up to execute vengeance, I have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be covered.
\[9]Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.
\[10]Heap on the wood, kindle the fire, boil thoroughly the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.
\[11]Then set it empty upon its coals, that it may be hot, and the brass of it may burn, and that its filthiness may be molten in it, [and] that its rust may be consumed.
\[12]She hath exhausted [her] labours, yet her great rust goeth not forth out of her: let her rust be in the fire.
\[13]In thy filthiness is lewdness, for I have purged thee, and thou art not pure. Thou shalt no more be purged from thy filthiness, till I have satisfied my fury upon thee.
\[14]I Jehovah have spoken [it]: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, nor will I repent. According to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[15]And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
\[16]Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke; yet thou shalt not mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.

\[18]—And I spoke unto the people in the morning; and at even my wife died. And I did in the morning as I was commanded.
\[19]And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, which thou doest?
\[20]And I said to them, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
\[21]Say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and your soul's longing; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by the sword.
\[22]And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover the beard, neither eat the bread of men;
\[23]and your turbans shall be upon your heads, and your sandals upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall waste away in your iniquities and moan one toward another.
\[24]Thus Ezekiel shall be unto you a sign; according to all that he hath done shall ye do: when it cometh, then ye shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.
\[25]And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereunto they lift up their soul, their sons and their daughters,
\[26]that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee, to cause [thine] ears to hear [it]?
\[27]In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him that is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb. So shalt thou be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah.

\[2]Son of man, because Tyre hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken, the gate of the peoples! she is turned unto me: I shall be replenished [now] she is laid waste;
\[3]therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth its waves to come up.
\[4]And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers. And I will scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock.
\[5]She shall be [a place] for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken [it], saith the Lord Jehovah; and she shall become a spoil for the nations.
\[6]And her daughters that are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah.
\[7]For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring from the north, against Tyre, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, the king of kings, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and an assemblage, and much people.
\[8]He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field, and he shall make forts against thee, and cast up a mound against thee, and lift up the target against thee;
\[9]and he shall set his engines of attack against thy walls, and with his spikes he shall break down thy towers.
\[10]By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee; thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter through thy gates, as a city is entered into, wherein is made a breach.
\[11]With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets; he shall slay thy people by the sword, and the pillars of thy strength shall go down to the ground.
\[12]And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy wares; and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses; and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the waters.
\[13]And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.
\[14]And I will make thee a bare rock; thou shalt be [a place] for the spreading of nets; thou shalt be built no more: for I Jehovah have spoken [it], saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[15]Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded groan, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?
\[16]And all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling, they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble [every] moment, and be astonied because of thee.
\[17]And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How hast thou perished, that wast inhabited from the seas, O renowned city, which wast strong in the sea,—she and her inhabitants, who caused their terror to be on all them that dwell therein!
\[18]Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; and the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.
\[19]For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I bring up the deep upon thee, and the great waters cover thee:
\[20]then will I bring thee down, with them that go down to the pit, to the people of old time, and will cause thee to dwell in the lower parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I will set glory in the land of the living.
\[21]And I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no [more]; and thou shalt be sought for, and shalt never be found again, for ever, saith the Lord Jehovah.

\[4]Thy borders are in the heart of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty.
\[5]They made all thy double boards of cypress-trees of Senir; they took cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.
\[6]Of the oaks of Bashan did they make thine oars; they made thy benches of ivory, inlaid in box-wood, out of the isles of Chittim.
\[7]Byssus with broidered work from Egypt was thy sail, to serve thee for a banner; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was thine awning.
\[8]The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy rowers; thy wise men, O Tyre, who were in thee, were thy pilots.
\[9]The elders of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee repairing thy leaks; all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee, to barter with thee.
\[10]Persia and Lud and Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged shield and helmet in thee; they gave splendour to thee.
\[11]The children of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadim were on thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they made thy beauty perfect.
\[12]Tarshish dealt with thee by reason of the abundance of all substance; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they furnished thy markets.
\[13]Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy traffickers: they bartered with thee the persons of men, and vessels of bronze.
\[14]They of the house of Togarmah furnished thy markets with horses, and horsemen, and mules.
\[15]The children of Dedan were thy traffickers; many isles were the mart of thy hand: they rendered in payment horns of ivory, and ebony.
\[16]Syria dealt with thee for the multitude of thy handiworks: they traded in thy markets with carbuncles, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and corals, and rubies.
\[17]Judah and the land of Israel were thy traffickers: they bartered with thee wheat of Minnith, and sweet cakes, and honey, and oil, and balm.
\[18]Damascus dealt with thee because of the multitude of thy handiworks, by reason of the abundance of all substance, with wine of Helbon, and white wool.
\[19]Vedan and Javan of Uzal traded in thy markets: wrought iron, cassia, and calamus were in thy traffic.
\[20]Dedan was thy trafficker in precious riding-cloths.
\[21]Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were the merchants of thy hand: in lambs, and rams, and goats, in these did they trade with thee.
\[22]The merchants of Sheba and Raamah were thy traffickers: they furnished thy markets with all the choice spices, and with all precious stones and gold.
\[23]Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad traded with thee:
\[24]these traded with thee in sumptuous clothes, in wrappings of blue and broidered work, and in chests full of variegated stuffs, bound with cords and made of cedar-wood, amongst thy merchandise.
\[25]The ships of Tarshish were thy caravans for thy traffic; and thou wast replenished, and highly honoured, in the heart of the seas.
\[26]Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters; the east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas.
\[27]Thy substance, and thy markets, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, they that repair thy leaks, and they that barter with thee, and all thy men of war that are in thee, along with all thine assemblage which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy fall.
\[28]The open places shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.
\[29]And all that handle the oar, the mariners, all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships; they shall stand upon the land,
\[30]and shall cause their voice to be heard over thee, and shall cry bitterly; and they shall cast up dust upon their heads; they shall wallow themselves in ashes.
\[31]And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird themselves with sackcloth; and they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning.
\[32]And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, [saying,] Who is like Tyre, like her that is destroyed in the midst of the sea?
\[33]When thy wares went forth over the seas, thou filledst many peoples; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the abundance of thy substance and of thy merchandise.
\[34]In the time [when] thou art broken by the seas, in the depths of the waters, thy merchandise and all thine assemblage in the midst of thee have fallen.
\[35]All the inhabitants of the isles are amazed at thee, and their kings are horribly afraid, [their] countenance is troubled.

\[4]by thy wisdom and by thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures;

Every precious stone was thy covering: the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the chrysolite, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the carbuncle, and the emerald, and gold. The workmanship of thy tambours and of thy pipes was in thee: in the day that thou wast created were they prepared.
\[14]Thou wast the anointed covering cherub, and I had set thee [so]: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou didst walk up and down in the midst of stones of fire.
\[15]Thou wast perfect in thy ways, from the day that thou wast created, till unrighteousness was found in thee.
\[16]By the abundance of thy traffic they filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned; therefore have I cast thee as profane from the mountain of God, and have destroyed thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
\[17]Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I have cast thee to the ground, I have laid thee before kings, that they may behold thee.
\[18]By the multitude of thine iniquities, by the unrighteousness of thy traffic, thou hast profaned thy sanctuaries: and I have brought forth a fire out of the midst of thee—it hath consumed thee; and I have brought thee to ashes upon the earth, in the sight of all them that behold thee.
\[19]All they that know thee among the peoples shall be amazed at thee: thou art become a terror, and thou shalt never be any more.
\[20]And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
\[21]Son of man, set thy face towards Zidon, and prophesy against it,

\[23]And I will send into her the pestilence, and blood in her streets; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her, by the sword upon her on every side: and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah.
\[24]And there shall be no more a wounding sting for the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn, among all that were round about them, that despised them: and they shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.
\[25]Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and shall be hallowed in them in the sight of the nations, then shall they dwell in their land which I have given to my servant Jacob.

\[11]No foot of man shall pass through it, nor shall foot of beast pass through it, nor shall it be inhabited, forty years.
\[12]And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolated, and her cities shall be, in the midst of the cities that are laid waste, a desolation forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
\[13]Yet thus saith the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered;
\[14]and I will turn again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return to the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth, and they shall there be a base kingdom.

\[2]Son of man, say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude: Whom art thou like in thy greatness?
\[3]Behold, Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon, with fair branches and a shadowing shroud, and of a high stature: and his top was amidst the thick boughs.
\[4]The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high; its streams ran round about his plantation, and it sent out its rivulets unto all the trees of the field.
\[5]Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long, because of great waters, when he shot forth.
\[6]All the fowl of the heavens made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all the great nations.
\[7]Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: because his root was by great waters.
\[8]The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him; the cypresses were not like his boughs, and the plane-trees were not as his branches: no tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.
\[9]I had made him fair by the multitude of his branches; and all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.
\[10]Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast lifted up thyself in stature, … and he hath set his top amidst the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height,
\[11]I have given him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.
\[12]And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off and have left him; upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken in all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.
\[13]Upon his fallen [trunk] do all the fowl of the heavens dwell, and all the beasts of the field are upon his branches:
\[14]to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, nor set their top amidst the thick boughs, and that none of them that drink water stand up in his height by himself; for they are all given over unto death in the lower parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
\[15]Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when he went down to Sheol, I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed; and I made Lebanon black for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
\[16]I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol, with them that go down into the pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the lower parts of the earth.
\[17]They also went down into Sheol with him unto them that were slain with the sword, and [that were] his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the nations.
\[18]To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? Yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden, unto the lower parts of the earth; thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword.

\[6]But if the watchman see the sword coming, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned, if the sword come and take a person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.
\[7]So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; and thou shalt hear the word from my mouth, and warn them from me.
\[8]When I say unto the wicked, Wicked [man], thou shalt certainly die; and thou speakest not to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked [man] shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
\[9]But if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
\[10]And thou, son of man, say unto the house of Israel, Thus ye speak, saying, Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we waste away in them, how then should we live?
\[11]Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
\[12]And thou, son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth.
\[13]When I say to the righteous that he shall certainly live, and he trusteth to his righteousness and doeth what is wrong, none of his righteous acts shall be remembered; but in his unrighteousness which he hath done, in it shall he die.
\[14]And when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt certainly die, and he turneth from his sin, and doeth judgment and justice;
\[15]if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, doing nothing that is wrong; he shall certainly live, he shall not die.
\[16]None of his sins which he hath committed shall be remembered against him: he hath done judgment and justice; he shall certainly live.
\[17]Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.
\[18]When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and doeth what is wrong, then he shall die therein.
\[19]And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness, and doeth judgment and justice, he shall live for these things.
\[20]Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.
\[21]And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth [month], on the fifth of the month, that one who had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten!
\[22]Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me in the evening, before he that had escaped came; and he had opened my mouth against his coming to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.
\[23]And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
\[24]Son of man, they that inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited this land, and we are many: the land is given us for a possession.
\[25]Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood; and shall ye possess the land?
\[26]Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife; and shall ye possess the land?
\[27]Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: [As] I live, verily they that are in the waste places shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.
\[28]And I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment, and the pride of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolated, so that none shall pass through.
\[29]And they shall know that I [am] Jehovah, when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment because of all their abominations which they have committed.
\[30]And as for thee, son of man, the children of thy people keep talking of thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from Jehovah.
\[31]And they come unto thee as a people cometh, and they sit before thee [as] my people, and they hear thy words, but they do them not; for with their mouth they shew much love, [but] their heart goeth after their dishonest gain.
\[32]And behold, thou art unto them as a lovely song, a pleasant voice, and one that playeth well on an instrument; and they hear thy words, but they do them not.
\[33]And when this cometh to pass (behold, it will come), then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.

\[2]Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy; and say unto them, unto the shepherds, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the shepherds of Israel that feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flock?
\[3]Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool; ye kill them that are fattened: [but] ye feed not the flock.
\[4]The weak have ye not strengthened, nor have ye healed the sick, and ye have not bound up [what was] broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought for that which was lost; but with harshness and with rigour have ye ruled over them.
\[5]And they were scattered because there was no shepherd; and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, and were scattered.
\[6]My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill, and my sheep have been scattered upon all the face of the earth, and there was none that searched, or that sought for them.
\[7]Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:
\[8][As] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, verily because my sheep have been a prey, and my sheep have been meat to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, and my shepherds searched not for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock,
\[9]—therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah.
\[10]Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock: that the shepherds may feed themselves no more; and I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, that they may not be food for them.
\[11]For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold I, [even] I, will both search for my sheep, and tend them.
\[12]As a shepherd tendeth his flock in the day that he is among his scattered sheep, so will I tend my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places whither they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
\[13]And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land; and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the water-courses, and in all the habitable places of the country.
\[14]I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie down in a good fold, and in a fat pasture they shall feed upon the mountains of Israel.
\[15]I will myself feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[16]I will seek the lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up the broken, and will strengthen that which was sick; but I will destroy the fat and the strong: I will feed them with judgment.
\[17]And as for you, my flock, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, between the rams and the he-goats.
\[18]Is it too small a thing unto you to have eaten up the good pastures, but ye must tread down with your feet the rest of your pastures; and to have drunk of the settled waters, but ye must foul the rest with your feet?
\[19]And my sheep have to eat that which ye have trodden with your feet, and to drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.
\[20]Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto them: Behold, [it is] I, and I will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
\[21]Because ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the weak ones with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad,
\[22]—I will save my flock, that they may no more be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.
\[23]And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David: he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
\[24]And I Jehovah will be their God, and my servant David a prince in their midst: I Jehovah have spoken [it].
\[25]And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land; and they shall dwell in safety in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
\[26]And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season: there shall be showers of blessing.
\[27]And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase; and they shall be in safety in their land, and shall know that I [am] Jehovah, when I have broken the bands of their yoke and delivered them out of the hand of those that kept them in servitude.
\[28]And they shall no more be a prey to the nations, neither shall the beast of the earth devour them; but they shall dwell in safety, and none shall make them afraid.
\[29]And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the ignominy of the nations any more.
\[30]And they shall know that I Jehovah their God [am] with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[31]And ye, my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men: I [am] your God, saith the Lord Jehovah.

\[4]I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be a desolation: and thou shalt know that I [am] Jehovah.
\[5]Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword, in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end;
\[6]therefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will certainly appoint thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee; since thou hast not hated blood, blood shall pursue thee.
\[7]And I will make mount Seir a desolation and an astonishment, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth;
\[8]and I will fill his mountains with his slain. In thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy water-courses shall they fall that are slain with the sword.
\[9]I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not be inhabited: and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.
\[10]Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it, whereas Jehovah was there:
\[11]therefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will even do according to thine anger and according to thine envy, as thou hast done out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I shall judge thee.

\[13]And ye have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard [them].
\[14]Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee a desolation.

\[3]therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because, yea, because they have made [you] desolate, and have swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the remnant of the nations, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and in the defaming of the people:
\[4]therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the water-courses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which are become a prey and a derision to the remnant of the nations that are round about,
\[5]—therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the remnant of the nations, and against the whole of Edom, which have appointed my land unto themselves for a possession with the joy of all [their] heart, with despite of soul, to plunder it by pillage.
\[6]Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and to the hills, to the water-courses and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the ignominy of the nations;
\[7]therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I have lifted up my hand, [saying,] Verily the nations that are about you, they shall bear their shame.
\[8]And ye mountains of Israel shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel: for they are at hand to come.
\[9]For behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown.
\[10]And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, the whole of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded.
\[11]And I will multiply upon you man and beast, and they shall increase and bring forth fruit; and I will cause you to be inhabited as [in] your former times, yea, I will make it better than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.
\[12]And I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of children.
\[13]Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because they say unto you, Thou devourest men, and hast bereaved thy nation,
\[14]therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nation any more, saith the Lord Jehovah;
\[15]neither will I cause thee to hear the ignominy of the nations any more, and thou shalt not bear the reproach of the peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nation to fall any more, saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[16]And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
\[17]Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a woman in her separation.
\[18]And I poured out my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols.
\[19]And I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.
\[20]And when they came to the nations whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when it was said of them, These are the people of Jehovah, and they are gone forth out of his land.
\[21]But I had pity for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations whither they went.
\[22]Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations whither ye went.
\[23]And I will hallow my great name, which was profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I [am] Jehovah, saith the Lord Jehovah, when I shall be hallowed in you before their eyes.
\[24]And I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.
\[25]And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your uncleannesses and from all your idols will I cleanse you.
\[26]And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.
\[27]And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances, and ye shall do them.
\[28]And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
\[29]And I will save you from all your uncleannesses; and I will call for the corn and will multiply it, and lay no famine upon you.
\[30]And I will multiply the fruit of the trees and the increase of the field, so that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations.
\[31]And ye shall remember your evil ways, and your doings which were not good, and shall loathe yourselves for your iniquities and for your abominations.
\[32]Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord Jehovah, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.
\[33]Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day that I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities I will also cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded.
\[34]And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by.
\[35]And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities [are] fortified [and] inhabited.
\[36]And the nations that shall be left round about you shall know that I Jehovah build the ruined places [and] plant that which was desolate: I Jehovah have spoken, and I will do [it].
\[37]Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it unto them; I will increase them with men like a flock.
\[38]As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her set feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah.

\[2]And he caused me to pass by them round about; and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and behold, they were very dry.

\[22]and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.
\[23]And they shall not defile themselves any more with their idols, or with their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions; and I will save them out of all their dwelling-places wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
\[24]And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: and they shall walk in mine ordinances, and keep my statutes, and do them.
\[25]And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.
\[26]And I will make a covenant of peace with them: it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever.

\[18]Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, [and] of bullocks, all of them fatted beasts of Bashan.
\[19]And ye shall eat fat till ye are full, and drink blood till ye are drunken, of my sacrifice which I sacrifice for you.
\[20]And ye shall be filled at my table with horses and charioteers, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[21]And I will set my glory among the nations, and all the nations shall see my judgment which I have executed, and my hand which I have laid upon them.
\[22]And the house of Israel shall know that I [am] Jehovah their God from that day and forward.
\[23]And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity, because they were unfaithful against me; and I hid my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies, so that they fell all of them by the sword.
\[24]According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions I did unto them, and I hid my face from them.
\[25]Therefore, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name:
\[26]and they shall bear their confusion, and all their unfaithfulness in which they have acted unfaithfully against me, when they shall dwell safely in their land, and none shall make them afraid;
\[27]when I have brought them again from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am hallowed in them in the sight of many nations.
\[28]And they shall know that I [am] Jehovah their God, in that I caused them to be led into captivity among the nations, and have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there.
\[29]And I will not hide my face any more from them, for I shall have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.

n the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, on that same day the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me thither.
\[2]In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain; and upon it was as the building of a city, on the south.
\[3]And he brought me thither, and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a flax-cord in his hand, and a measuring-reed; and he stood in the gate.
\[4]And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for in order that it might be shewn unto thee art thou brought hither. Declare to the house of Israel all that thou seest.
\[5]And behold, there was a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring-reed of six cubits, [each] of one cubit and a hand breadth. And he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.
\[6]And he came to the gate which looked toward the east, and went up its steps; and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold one reed broad.
\[7]And [each] chamber was one reed long and one reed broad; and between the chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate, beside the porch of the gate within, was one reed.
\[8]And he measured the porch of the gate within, one reed.
\[9]And he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.
\[10]And the chambers of the gate which was toward the east were three on this side and three on that side: they three were of one measure; and the posts on this side and on that side had one measure.
\[11]And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; [and] the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
\[12]And there was a border before the chambers of one cubit, and a border of one cubit on the other side; and the chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
\[13]And he measured the gate from the roof of [one] chamber to the roof [of the other], a breadth of five and twenty cubits, entry opposite entry.
\[14]And he made posts, sixty cubits, and by the post was the court of the gate round about.
\[15]And from the front of the gate of the entrance unto the front of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.
\[16]And there were closed windows to the chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the projections; and the windows round about were inward; and upon [each] post were palm-trees.
\[17]And he brought me into the outer court, and behold, there were cells, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty cells were upon the pavement.
\[18]And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answering to the length of the gates, [namely] the lower pavement.
\[19]And he measured the breadth from the front of the lower gate unto the front of the inner court outside, a hundred cubits eastward and northward.
\[20]And the gate of the outer court, that looked toward the north, he measured its length and its breadth.
\[21]And its chambers were three on this side and three on that side; and its posts and its projections were according to the measure of the first gate: its length was fifty cubits, and breadth five and twenty cubits.
\[22]And its windows, and its projections, and its palm-trees were according to the measure of the gate that looked toward the east; and they went up to it by seven steps; and the projections thereof were before them.
\[23]And the gate of the inner court was opposite to the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.
\[24]And he brought me toward the south: and behold, there was a gate toward the south; and he measured its posts and its projections according to these measures.
\[25]And there were windows to it and to its projections round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
\[26]And there were seven steps to go up to it; and its projections were before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side and one on that side, upon its posts.
\[27]And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits.
\[28]And he brought me into the inner court by the south gate; and he measured the south gate according to these measures:
\[29]and its chambers, and its posts, and its projections, according to these measures; and there were windows to it and to its projections round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
\[30]And there were projections round about, twenty-five cubits long, and five cubits broad.
\[31]And its projections were toward the outer court; and there were palm-trees upon its posts: and its ascent was [by] eight steps.
\[32]And he brought me into the inner court toward the east; and he measured the gate according to these measures:
\[33]and its chambers, and its posts, and its projections, according to these measures; and there were windows to it and to its projections round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
\[34]And its projections were toward the outer court; and there were palm-trees upon its posts on this side and on that side: and its ascent was [by] eight steps.
\[35]And he brought me to the north gate, and he measured [it] according to these measures:
\[36]its chambers, its posts, and its projections; and there were windows to it round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
\[37]And its posts were toward the outer court; and there were palm-trees upon its posts, on this side and on that side: and its ascent was [by] eight steps.
\[38]And there was a cell and its entry by the posts of the gates; there they rinsed the burnt-offering.
\[39]And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.
\[40]And at the side without, at the ascent to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables:
\[41]four tables on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate,—eight tables, whereon they slew [the sacrifice],
\[42]—and at the ascent, four tables of hewn stone, of a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; whereon also they laid the instruments with which they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.
\[43]And the double hooks of a hand breadth were fastened round about within; and upon the tables [they put] the flesh of the offering.
\[44]And outside the inner gate were two cells in the inner court, one at the side of the north gate, and its front towards the south; the other was at the side of the south gate, the front towards the north.
\[45]And he said unto me, This cell whose front is towards the south is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.
\[46]And the cell whose front is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, those who, from among the sons of Levi, approach unto Jehovah to minister unto him.
\[47]And he measured the court, the length a hundred cubits, and the breadth a hundred cubits, four square: and the altar was before the house.
\[48]And he brought me to the porch of the house; and he measured the post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side; and the breadth of the gate, three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
\[49]The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, even by the steps whereby they went up to it; and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and one on that side.

\[2]And the breadth of the entry was ten cubits, and the sides of the entry were five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side; and he measured its length, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.
\[3]And he went inwards, and measured the post of the entry, two cubits; and the entry, six cubits; and the breadth of the entry, seven cubits.
\[4]And he measured its length, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy [place].
\[5]And he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of the side-chambers, four cubits, round about the house on every side.
\[6]And the side-chambers were three, chamber over chamber, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which the house had for the side-chambers round about, that they might have hold; but they had not hold in the wall of the house.
\[7]And for the side-chambers there was an enlarging, and it went round about [the house] increasing upward; for the surrounding of the house increased upward round about the house; therefore the house had width upward, and so ascended [from] the lower [story] to the upper, by the middle one.
\[8]And I saw that the house had an elevation round about: the foundations of the side-chambers, a full reed, six cubits to the joint.
\[9]The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers without, was five cubits, as also what was left free along the building of the side-chambers that pertained to the house.
\[10]And between the cells [and the house] was a width of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.
\[11]And the entry of the side-chambers was toward what was left free, one entry toward the north, and one entry toward the south; and the width of the space left free was five cubits round about.
\[12]And the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about; and its length ninety cubits.
\[13]And he measured the house: the length a hundred cubits; and the separate place, and the building, and its walls, the length a hundred cubits;
\[14]and the breadth of the front of the house, and of the separate places toward the east, a hundred cubits.
\[15]And he measured the length of the building before the separate place, which was at the back of it, with its galleries on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court.
\[16]The thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round about the three of them (opposite the thresholds it was wainscoted with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered),
\[17][and] above, over the entry, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about, within and without, [all was] by measure.
\[18]And it was made with cherubim and palm-trees, and a palm-tree was between cherub and cherub; and the cherub had two faces:
\[19]the face of a man was toward the palm-tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm-tree on the other side: [so] was it made upon all the house round about.
\[20]From the ground unto above the entry were the cherubim and the palm-trees made, and [on] the wall of the temple.
\[21]As for the temple, the door-posts were squared; and the front of the sanctuary had the same appearance.
\[22]The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits; and its corners, and its length, and its walls were of wood. And he said unto me, This is the table which is before Jehovah.
\[23]And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
\[24]And the doors had two leaves, two turning-leaves: two for the one door, and two leaves for the other.
\[25]And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, as there were made upon the walls; and there was a wooden portal in front of the porch without,
\[26]and closed windows and palm-trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch and the side chambers of the house and the portals.

nd he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north; and he brought me to the cells that were over against the separate place and which were over against the building, toward the north,
\[2]before the length of the hundred cubits: the entry was on the north, and the breadth was fifty cubits,
\[3]over against the twenty [cubits] that pertained to the inner court, and over against the pavement that pertained to the outer court; there was gallery against gallery in the third [story];
\[4]and before the cells was a walk of ten cubits in breadth, [and] a way of a hundred cubits inward; and their entries were toward the north.
\[5]And the upper cells, because the galleries encroached on them, were shorter than the lower, and than the middle-most of the building.
\[6]For they were in three [stories], but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts; therefore [the third story] was straitened more than the lowest and the middle-most from the ground.
\[7]And the wall that was without, answering to the cells, toward the outer court in the front of the cells, its length was fifty cubits:
\[8]for the length of the cells that were against the outer court was fifty cubits; but behold, before the temple it was a hundred cubits.
\[9]And under these cells was the entry from the east, as one goeth into them from the outer court.
\[10]In the breadth of the wall of the court toward the south, before the separate place, and before the building, were cells;
\[11]and a passage before them, like the appearance of the cells that were toward the north, according to their length, according to their breadth and all their goings out, and according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
\[12]And according to the doors of the cells that were toward the south there was a door at the head of the way, the way directly before the corresponding wall toward the east as one entereth into them.
\[13]And he said unto me, The north cells [and] the south cells, which are before the separate place, they are holy cells, where the priests that come near unto Jehovah shall eat the most holy things; there shall they lay the most holy things, both the oblation and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering: for the place is holy.
\[14]When the priests enter in, they shall not go forth from the sanctuary into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister, for they are holy; and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which is for the people.
\[15]And when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose front was toward the east, and measured [the enclosure] round about.
\[16]He measured the east side with the measuring-reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring-reed round about.
\[17]He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring-reed round about.
\[18]He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring-reed.
\[19]He turned about to the west side, [and] measured five hundred reeds with the measuring-reed.
\[20]He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall round about, five hundred long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common.

\[2]And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east; and his voice was like the voice of many waters; and the earth was lit up with his glory.
\[3]And the appearance of the vision that I saw was according to the vision that I had seen when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar: and I fell upon my face.
\[4]And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose front was toward the east.
\[5]And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.
\[6]And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a man was standing by me.
\[7]And he said unto me, Son of man, [this is] the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever; and the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, they nor their kings, with their fornication, and with the carcases of their kings [in] their high places,
\[8]in that they set their threshold by my threshold, and their post by my post, and [there was only] a wall between me and them, and they defiled my holy name with their abominations which they committed; and I consumed them in mine anger.
\[9]Now let them put away their fornication, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.
\[10]Thou, son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be confounded at their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.
\[11]And if they be confounded at all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, and its fashion, and its goings out, and its comings in, and all its forms, and all its statutes, yea, all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof; and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the statutes thereof, and do them.
\[12]This is the law of the house: Upon the top of the mountain all its border round about is most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.
\[13]And these are the measures of the altar in cubits: the cubit is a cubit and a hand breadth. The bottom was a cubit [in height] and the breadth a cubit, and its border on the edge thereof round about, one span: and this was the base of the altar.
\[14]And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower settle was two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the small settle to the great settle, four cubits, and the breadth a cubit.
\[15]And the upper altar was four cubits; and from the hearth of God and upward were four horns.
\[16]And the hearth of God was twelve [cubits] long, by twelve broad, square in the four sides thereof.
\[17]And the settle was fourteen [cubits] long by fourteen broad in the four sides thereof; and the border about it, half a cubit; and the bottom thereof a cubit round about: and its steps looked toward the east.
\[18]And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer up burnt-offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.
\[19]And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who come near unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord Jehovah, a young bullock for a sin-offering.
\[20]And thou shalt take of its blood, and put it on the four horns thereof, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: so shalt thou purge and make atonement for it.
\[21]And thou shalt take the bullock of the sin-offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary.
\[22]And on the second day thou shalt present a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall purge the altar, as they purged it with the bullock.
\[23]When thou hast ended purging it, thou shalt present a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish;
\[24]and thou shalt present them before Jehovah; and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.
\[25]Seven days shalt thou offer daily a goat for a sin-offering; they shall also offer a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
\[26]Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it, and consecrate it.
\[27]And when these days are ended, it shall be that upon the eighth day and onwards the priests shall offer your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace-offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord Jehovah.

\[3]As for the prince, he, the prince, shall sit in it to eat bread before Jehovah: he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.
\[4]And he brought me the way of the north gate before the house; and I beheld, and lo, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah: and I fell upon my face.
\[5]And Jehovah said unto me, Son of man, apply thy heart, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the statutes of the house of Jehovah, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary;
\[6]and say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Let it suffice you of all your abominations, O house of Israel,
\[7]in that ye have brought strangers, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, [even] my house, when ye offered my bread, the fat and the blood; and they have broken my covenant besides all your abominations.
\[8]And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things, but have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
\[9]Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: No stranger, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel.
\[10]But the Levites who went away far from me, when Israel went astray, going astray from me after their idols, they shall even bear their iniquity;
\[11]but they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and doing the service of the house: they shall slaughter the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.
\[12]Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and were unto the house of Israel a stumbling-block of iniquity; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord Jehovah, that they shall bear their iniquity.
\[13]And they shall not draw near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to draw near to any of my holy things, [even] to the most holy; but they shall bear their confusion, and their abominations which they have committed.
\[14]And I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.
\[15]But the priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall approach unto me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to present unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[16]They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall approach unto my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.
\[17]And it shall come to pass when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, when they minister in the gates of the inner court, and towards the house.
\[18]They shall have linen tires upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird on anything that causeth sweat.
\[19]And when they go forth into the outer court, into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy cells; and they shall put on other garments, that they may not hallow the people with their garments.
\[20]Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long: they shall duly poll their heads.
\[21]Neither shall any priest drink wine when they enter into the inner court.
\[22]And they shall not take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away; but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that is the widow of a priest.
\[23]And they shall teach my people [the difference] between holy and profane, and cause them to discern between unclean and clean.
\[24]And in controversy they shall stand to judge: they shall judge it according to my judgments; and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my solemnities; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.
\[25]And they shall come at no dead person to become unclean; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may become unclean.
\[26]And after he is cleansed, they shall count unto him seven days.
\[27]And on the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall present his sin-offering, saith the Lord Jehovah.
\[28]And it shall be unto them for an inheritance; I am their inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession.
\[29]They shall eat the oblation and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs.
\[30]And the first of all the first-fruits of every [kind], and every heave-offering of every [kind], of all your heave-offerings, shall be for the priests; ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest on thy house.

\[17]And it shall be the prince's part [to supply] the burnt-offerings, and the oblation, and the drink-offering, at the feasts, and at the new moons, and on the sabbaths, in all the solemnities of the house of Israel: it is he that shall prepare the sin-offering, and the oblation, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.
\[18]Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the first [month], on the first of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock, without blemish, and thou shalt purge the sanctuary.
\[19]And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.
\[20]So thou shalt do also on the seventh of the month for every one that erreth, and for the simple; and ye shall make atonement for the house.
\[21]In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days: unleavened bread shall be eaten.
\[22]And upon that day shall the prince offer for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering.
\[23]And the seven days of the feast he shall offer a burnt-offering to Jehovah, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily for the seven days; and a he-goat daily for a sin-offering.
\[24]And he shall offer an oblation of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram; and oil, a hin for an ephah.
\[25]In the seventh [month], on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast, shall he do the like seven days, according to the sin-offering, according to the burnt-offering, and according to the oblation, and according to the oil.

hus saith the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working-days; but on the sabbath-day it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
\[2]And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of [that] gate from without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall offer his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate, and shall go forth: but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
\[3]And the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before Jehovah on the sabbaths and on the new moons.
\[4]And the burnt-offering that the prince shall present unto Jehovah on the sabbath-day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.
\[5]And the oblation shall be an ephah for a ram, and the oblation for the lambs as he shall be able to give; and oil, a hin for an ephah.
\[6]And on the day of the new moon, a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish.
\[7]And he shall offer an oblation, an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according to what his hand may attain unto; and oil, a hin for an ephah.
\[8]And when the prince cometh in, he shall come in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go out by the way thereof.
\[9]And when the people of the land come in before Jehovah in the set feasts, he that cometh in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that cometh in by the way of the south gate shall go out by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate by which he came in, but shall go out straight before him.
\[10]And the prince shall come in in the midst of them, when they come in; and when they go out, they shall go out [together].
\[11]And on the feast-days, and in the solemnities, the oblation shall be an ephah for a bullock and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give; and oil, a hin for an ephah.
\[12]And when the prince shall offer a voluntary burnt-offering or voluntary peace-offerings unto Jehovah, the gate that looketh toward the east shall be opened for him and he shall offer his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings as he did on the sabbath-day, and he shall go out again, and the gate shall be shut after he hath gone out.
\[13]And thou shalt daily offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah, of a yearling-lamb without blemish: thou shalt prepare it morning by morning.
\[14]And thou shalt prepare an oblation with it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and of oil the third part of a hin, to moisten the fine flour: an oblation unto Jehovah continually by a perpetual ordinance.
\[15]They shall offer the lamb, and the oblation, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt-offering.
\[16]Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, it shall be that one's inheritance, for his sons: it shall be their possession by inheritance.
\[17]But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his until the year of liberty; and it shall return to the prince: to his sons alone shall his inheritance remain.
\[18]And the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance, to thrust them by oppression out of their possession: he shall give his sons an inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every one from his possession.
\[19]Then he brought me through the passage which was at the side of the gate, into the holy cells which were for the priests, which looked toward the north; and behold, a place was there at the end westward.
\[20]And he said unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offering, and the sin-offering, [and] where they shall bake the oblation, that they bring them not out into the outer court, so as to hallow the people.
\[21]And he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.
\[22]In the four corners of the court there were enclosed courts, forty [cubits] long and thirty broad: these four corner courts were of one measure.
\[23]And there was a row [of building] round about in them, round about those four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about.
\[24]And he said unto me, These are the boiling-houses, where those who do the service of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.

nd he brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the front of the house was eastward. And the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, south of the altar.
\[2]And he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round outside unto the outer gate towards [the gate] that looketh eastward; and behold, waters ran out on the right side.
\[3]When the man went forth eastward, a line was in his hand; and he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters: the waters were to the ankles.
\[4]And he measured a thousand [cubits], and caused me to pass through the waters: the waters were to the knees. And he measured a thousand and caused me to pass through: the waters were to the loins.
\[5]And he measured a thousand: it was a river that I could not pass through, for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.
\[6]And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen [this]? And he led me, and brought me back to the bank of the river.
\[7]When I returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
\[8]And he said unto me, These waters issue out toward the east district, and go down into the plain, and go into the sea; when they are brought forth into the sea, the waters [thereof] shall be healed.
\[9]And it shall come to pass that every living thing which moveth, whithersoever the double river shall come, shall live. And there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters shall come thither, and [the waters of the sea] shall be healed; and everything shall live whither the river cometh.
\[10]And it shall come to pass, that fishers shall stand upon it; from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim shall be [a place] to spread forth nets: their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.
\[11]But its marshes and its pools shall not be healed; they shall be given up to salt.
\[12]And by the river, upon its bank, on the one side and on the other, shall grow all trees for food, whose leaf shall not fade, nor their fruit fail: it shall bring forth new fruit every month, for its waters issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for medicine.
\[13]Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This shall be the border whereby ye shall allot the land as inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph [shall have two] portions.
\[14]And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another, [the land] concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it unto your fathers; and this land shall fall to you for inheritance.
\[15]And this shall be the border of the land: toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Zedad,
\[16]Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran.
\[17]And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath: this is the north side.
\[18]—And on the east side ye shall measure between Hauran and Damascus, and Gilead and the land of Israel [by] the Jordan, from the border unto the east sea: this is the east side.
\[19]—And the south side southward, from Tamar to the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, by the torrent, unto the great sea: this is the south side southward.
\[20]—And the west side shall be the great sea from the border, as far as over against the entering into Hamath: this is the west side.
\[21]And ye shall divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.
\[22]And it shall come to pass that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, who shall beget children among you; and they shall be unto you as the home-born among the children of Israel: with you shall they draw by lot inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
\[23]And it shall come to pass that in the tribe in which the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give [him] his inheritance, saith the Lord Jehovah.

n the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.
\[2]And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, and a part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar, to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.
\[3]And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz the chief of his eunuchs, that he should bring of the children of Israel, both of the royal seed and of the nobles,
\[4]youths in whom was no blemish, and of goodly countenance, and skilful in all wisdom, and acquainted with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the language of the Chaldeans.
\[5]And the king appointed unto them a daily provision of the king's delicate food, and of the wine that he drank, to nourish them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.
\[6]Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
\[7]And the prince of the eunuchs gave them names: to Daniel he gave [the name] Belteshazzar, and to Hananiah, Shadrach, and to Mishael, Meshach, and to Azariah, Abed-nego.
\[8]And Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not pollute himself with the king's delicate food, nor with the wine which he drank; and he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not have to pollute himself.
\[9]And God granted Daniel favour and mercy before the prince of the eunuchs.
\[10]And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king who hath appointed your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces worse liking than the youths who are of your age? and ye would endanger my head with the king.
\[11]And Daniel said to the steward, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
\[12]Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink;
\[13]then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king's delicate food: and as thou shalt see, deal with thy servants.
\[14]And he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
\[15]And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and were fatter in flesh than all the youths that ate of the king's delicate food.
\[16]So the steward took away their delicate food, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.
\[17]As for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
\[18]And at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
\[19]And the king spoke with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: and they stood before the king.
\[20]And in all matters of judicious wisdom, as to which the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the scribes [and] magicians that were in all his realm.
\[21]And Daniel continued unto the first year of king Cyrus.

nd in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him.
\[2]And the king commanded to call the scribes, and the magicians, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to shew the king his dreams; and they came and stood before the king.
\[3]And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.
\[4]And the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, O king, live for ever! tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.
\[5]The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The command is gone forth from me: If ye do not make known unto me the dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.
\[6]But if ye shew the dream and its interpretation, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour; therefore shew me the dream and its interpretation.
\[7]They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.
\[8]The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that ye would gain time, because ye see the word is gone forth from me;
\[9]but if ye do not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me its interpretation.
\[10]The Chaldeans answered before the king and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter; therefore there is no king, however great and powerful, that hath asked such a thing of any scribe, or magician, or Chaldean.
\[11]For the thing that the king demandeth is extraordinary, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.
\[12]For this cause the king was irritated and very wroth, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
\[13]And the decree went forth that the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to slay them.
\[14]Then Daniel answered with counsel and prudence to Arioch the chief of the king's bodyguard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:
\[15]he answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so rigorous from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
\[16]And Daniel went in, and requested of the king that he would give him time, that he might shew the king the interpretation.
\[17]Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions;
\[18]that they would desire mercies of the God of the heavens concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
\[19]Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of the heavens.
\[20]Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; For wisdom and might are his.
\[21]And it is he that changeth times and seasons; He deposeth kings, and setteth up kings; He giveth wisdom to the wise, And knowledge to them that know understanding.
\[22]It is he that revealeth the deep and secret things; He knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.
\[23]I thank thee, and I praise thee, O God of my fathers, Who hast given me wisdom and might, And hast made known unto me already what we desired of thee; For thou hast made known unto us the king's matter.
\[24]Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.
\[25]Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him: I have found a man of the sons of the captivity of Judah that will make known unto the king the interpretation.
\[26]The king answered and said unto Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream that I have seen, and its interpretation?
\[27]Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said, The secret that the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the magicians, the scribes, the astrologers, shew unto the king;
\[28]but there is a God in the heavens, who revealeth secrets, and maketh known to king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be at the end of days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are these:
\[29]—as for thee, O king, thy thoughts arose upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass.
\[30]And as for me, this secret is revealed to me, not by [any] wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation should be made known to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.
\[31]Thou, O king, sawest, and behold, a great image. This image was mighty and its brightness excellent; it stood before thee, and its appearance was terrible.
\[32]This image's head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,
\[33]its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay.
\[34]Thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands; and it smote the image upon its feet of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.
\[35]Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken in pieces together, and they became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, and no place was found for them. And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
\[36]This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.
\[37]Thou, O king, art a king of kings, unto whom the God of the heavens hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;
\[38]and wheresoever the children of men, the beasts of the field, and the fowl of the heavens dwell, he hath given them into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all: thou art this head of gold.
\[39]And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; then another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.
\[40]And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth everything, and as iron that breaketh all these, so shall it break in pieces and bruise.
\[41]And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potter's clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.
\[42]And [as] the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay, the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile.
\[43]And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay.
\[44]And in the days of these kings shall the God of the heavens set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the sovereignty thereof shall not be left to another people: it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, but itself shall stand for ever.
\[45]Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold,—the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter. And the dream is certain, and the interpretation of it sure.
\[46]Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.
\[47]The king answered Daniel and said, Of a truth it is that your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, because thou wast able to reveal this secret.
\[48]Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.
\[49]And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego over the administration of the province of Babylon. And Daniel was in the gate of the king.

ebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits, [and] its breadth six cubits; he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
\[2]And Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the justices, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
\[3]Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the justices, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
\[4]And the herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, [O] peoples, nations, and languages,
\[5]that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, pipe, lute, sambuca, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up;
\[6]and whosoever doth not fall down and worship shall that same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
\[7]Therefore at that time when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, pipe, lute, sambuca, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages fell down [and] worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
\[8]Whereupon at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.
\[9]They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever!
\[10]Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, pipe, lute, sambuca, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;
\[11]and [that] whosoever doth not fall down and worship, shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
\[12]There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: these men, O king, regard thee not; they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image that thou hast set up.
\[13]Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then were these men brought before the king.
\[14]Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them, Is it of purpose, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my god, nor worship the golden image that I have set up?
\[15]Now if ye be ready at the time that ye hear the sound of the cornet, pipe, lute, sambuca, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, [well]: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast that same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace: and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hands?
\[16]Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.
\[17]If it be [so], our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver [us] out of thy hand, O king.
\[18]But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image that thou hast set up.
\[19]Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. He spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.
\[20]And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
\[21]Then these men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their cloaks, and their garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
\[22]Forasmuch as the king's commandment was rigorous, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that had taken up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.
\[23]And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
\[24]Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste; he spoke and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king.
\[25]He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of God.
\[26]Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the opening of the burning fiery furnace; he spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come [hither]. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth from the midst of the fire.
\[27]And the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had had no power, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.
\[28]Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants who trusted in him, and who changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God!
\[29]Therefore I make a decree, that in every people, nation, and language, he who shall speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and his house shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that is able to deliver after this sort.
\[30]Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in the province of Babylon.

ebuchadnezzar the king unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.
\[2]It hath seemed good unto me to declare the signs and wonders that the Most High God hath wrought toward me.
\[3]How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.
\[4]I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.
\[5]I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
\[6]And I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.
\[7]Then came in the scribes, the magicians, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation of it.
\[8]But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and before him I told the dream:
\[9]O Belteshazzar, master of the scribes, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret is too hard for thee, tell me the visions of my dream which I have seen, and the interpretation of it.
\[10]Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.
\[11]The tree grew, and was strong, and its height reached unto the heavens, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.
\[12]Its leaves were beautiful, and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.
\[13]I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from the heavens;
\[14]he cried aloud, and said thus: Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit; let the beasts get away from under it, and the birds from its branches.
\[15]Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be bathed with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.
\[16]Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.
\[17]This sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the decision by the word of the holy ones: that the living may know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.
\[18]This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and thou, Belteshazzar, tell the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.
\[19]Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, nor its interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and its interpretation to thine enemies!
\[20]The tree that thou sawest, which grew and was strong, whose height reached unto the heavens, and the sight of it to all the earth;
\[21]whose leaves were beautiful, and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and in whose branches the birds of the heavens had their habitation:
\[22]it is thou, O king, who art grown and become strong; for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto the heavens, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.
\[23]And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from the heavens, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be bathed with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him:
\[24]this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which cometh upon my lord the king:
\[25]They shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and thou shalt be bathed with the dew of heaven; and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
\[26]And whereas it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom shall remain unto thee, after that thou shalt know that the heavens do rule.
\[27]Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.
\[28]All this came upon king Nebuchadnezzar.
\[29]At the end of twelve months he was walking upon the royal palace of Babylon:
\[30]the king spoke and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?
\[31]While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from the heavens: King Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from thee;
\[32]and they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
\[33]The same hour was the word fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar; and he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen; and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven, till his hair grew like eagles' [feathers], and his nails like birds' [claws].
\[34]And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto the heavens, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation.
\[35]And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he doeth according to his will in the army of the heavens, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?
\[36]At the same time mine understanding returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my nobles sought me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added unto me.
\[37]Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of the heavens, all whose works are truth, and his paths judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.

elshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his nobles, and drank wine before the thousand.
\[2]Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines, might drink in them.
\[3]Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines, drank in them.
\[4]They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
\[5]In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
\[6]Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.
\[7]The king cried aloud to bring in the magicians, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\[8]Then came in all the king's wise men, but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation.
\[9]Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his nobles were confounded.
\[10]—The queen, by reason of the words of the king and his nobles, came into the banquet-house. The queen spoke and said, O king, live for ever! let not thy thoughts trouble thee, neither let thy countenance be changed.
\[11]There is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father, light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods was found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, [even] the king thy father, made him master of the scribes, magicians, Chaldeans, [and] astrologers;
\[12]forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and solving of problems, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.
\[13]Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spoke and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?
\[14]And I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and [that] light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.
\[15]And now the wise men, the magicians, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof; but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing.
\[16]But I have heard of thee, that thou canst give interpretations, and solve problems. Now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\[17]Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet will I read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
\[18]O thou king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty;
\[19]and for the greatness that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he exalted, and whom he would he humbled.
\[20]But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit hardened unto presumption, he was deposed from the throne of his kingdom, and they took his glory from him;
\[21]and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the Most High God ruleth over the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.
\[22]And thou, Belshazzar, his son, hast not humbled thy heart, although thou knewest all this;
\[23]but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of the heavens; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy nobles, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:
\[24]then from before him was sent the part of the hand, and this writing hath been written.
\[25]And this is the writing that is written: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
\[26]This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE, God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it;
\[27]TEKEL, Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting;
\[28]PERES, Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
\[29]Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and [put] a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\[30]In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.
\[31]And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, [being] about sixty-two years old.

t pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be in all the kingdom;
\[2]and over these, three presidents—of whom Daniel was one—to whom these satraps should render account, and that the king should suffer no loss.
\[3]Now this Daniel surpassed the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to appoint him over the whole realm.
\[4]Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find a pretext against Daniel with respect to the kingdom; but they could not find any pretext or fault; inasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.
\[5]Then said these men, We shall not find any pretext against this Daniel, unless we find [it] against him touching the law of his God.
\[6]Then these presidents and satraps came in a body to the king, and said thus unto him: King Darius, live for ever!
\[7]All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects, and the satraps, the counsellors, and the governors have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
\[8]Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked.
\[9]Therefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.
\[10]And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and, his windows being open in his upper chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.
\[11]But those men came in a body, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.
\[12]Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king's decree: Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask [anything] of any god or man within thirty days, except of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked.
\[13]Then they answered and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.
\[14]Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore distressed thereby, and set his heart on Daniel to save him; and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.
\[15]Then these men came in a body unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.
\[16]Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast [him] into the den of lions. The king spoke and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will save thee.
\[17]And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his nobles, that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.
\[18]Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were concubines brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.
\[19]Then the king arose with the light at break of day, and went in haste unto the den of lions.
\[20]And when he came near unto the den, he cried with a mournful voice unto Daniel: the king spoke and said unto Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, hath thy God whom thou servest continually been able to save thee from the lions?
\[21]Then Daniel spoke unto the king, O king, live for ever!
\[22]My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocence was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.
\[23]Thereupon was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.
\[24]And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces ere they came to the bottom of the den.
\[25]Then king Darius wrote unto all peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.
\[26]I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and steadfast for ever, and his kingdom [that] which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.
\[27]He saveth and delivereth, and he worketh signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth: who hath saved Daniel from the power of the lions.
\[28]And this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

n the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream; he told the sum of the matters.
\[2]Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of the heavens broke forth upon the great sea.
\[3]And four great beasts came up from the sea, different one from another.
\[4]The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till its wings were plucked; and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.
\[5]And behold, another beast, a second, like unto a bear, and it raised up itself on one side; and [it had] three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and they said thus unto it: Arise, devour much flesh.
\[6]After this I saw, and behold, another, like a leopard, and it had four wings of a bird upon its back; and the beast had four heads; and dominion was given to it.
\[7]After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and exceeding strong; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
\[8]I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another, a little horn, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.
\[9]I beheld till thrones were set, and the Ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was flames of fire, [and] its wheels burning fire.
\[10]A stream of fire issued and came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
\[11]I beheld therefore, because of the voice of the great words that the horn spoke; I beheld till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given up to be burned with fire.
\[12]As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away; but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
\[13]I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of heaven [one] like a son of man, and he came up even to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
\[14]And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom [that] which shall not be destroyed.
\[15]As for me Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.
\[16]I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the certainty of all this. And he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things:
\[17]These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, [that] shall arise out of the earth.
\[18]But the saints of the most high [places] shall receive the kingdom, and they shall possess the kingdom for ever, even to the ages of ages.
\[19]Then I desired to know the certainty concerning the fourth beast, which was different from them all, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet;
\[20]and concerning the ten horns that were in its head, and the other that came up, and before which three fell: even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, and whose look was more imposing than its fellows.
\[21]I beheld, and that horn made war with the saints, and prevailed over them;
\[22]until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most high [places]; and the appointed time arrived, and the saints possessed the kingdom.
\[23]He said thus: The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon the earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
\[24]And as to the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall arise ten kings; and another shall arise after them; and he shall be different from the former, and he shall subdue three kings.
\[25]And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most high [places], and think to change seasons and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and a half time.
\[26]And the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.
\[27]But the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heavens, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high [places]. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
\[28]So far is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart.

n the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king, a vision appeared unto me, [even] to me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.
\[2]And I saw in the vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was in the fortress of Shushan, which is in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.
\[3]And I lifted up mine eyes and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns; and the two horns were high; and one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
\[4]I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward, and no beast could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; and he did according to his will, and became great.
\[5]And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.
\[6]And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.
\[7]And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged with him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; and he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
\[8]And the he-goat became exceeding great; but when he was become strong, the great horn was broken; and in its stead came up four notable ones toward the four winds of the heavens.
\[9]And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which became exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beauty [of the earth].
\[10]And it became great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down [some] of the host and of the stars to the ground, and trampled upon them.
\[11](And he magnified [himself] even to the prince of the host, and from him the continual [sacrifice] was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
\[12]And a time of trial was appointed unto the continual [sacrifice] by reason of transgression.) And it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised and prospered.
\[13]And I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that one who spoke, How long shall be the vision of the continual [sacrifice] and of the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden down under foot?
\[14]And he said unto me, Until two thousand and three hundred evenings [and] mornings: then shall the sanctuary be vindicated.
\[15]And it came to pass, when I Daniel had seen the vision, I sought for the understanding of it, and behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.
\[16]And I heard a man's voice between [the banks of] the Ulai; and he called and said, Gabriel, make this [man] to understand the vision.
\[17]And he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face; and he said unto me, Understand, son of man; for the vision is for the time of the end.
\[18]Now, as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep stupor, with my face toward the ground. And he touched me, and set me up where I had stood.
\[19]And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be at the end of the indignation: for at the set time the end shall be.
\[20]The ram that thou sawest having the two horns: they are the kings of Media and Persia.
\[21]And the rough goat is the king of Greece; and the great horn that was between his eyes is the first king.
\[22]Now that being broken, whereas four stood up in its stead, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.
\[23]And at the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors shall have come to the full, a king of bold countenance, and understanding riddles, shall stand up.
\[24]And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy marvellously, and shall prosper, and shall practise, and shall destroy the mighty ones, and the people of the saints.
\[25]And through his cunning shall he cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he will magnify [himself] in his heart, and by prosperity will corrupt many; and he will stand up against the Prince of princes: but he shall be broken without hand.
\[26]And the vision of the evening and the morning which hath been told is true; but close thou up the vision, for it is for many days [to come].
\[27]And I Daniel fainted, and was sick [certain] days: then I rose up, and did the king's business. And I was astonished at the vision, but none understood [it].

\[2]in the first year of his reign, I Daniel understood by the books that the number of the years, whereof the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishment of the desolations of Jerusalem, was seventy years.
\[3]And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes;
\[4]and I prayed unto Jehovah my God, and made my confession, and said, Alas Lord! the great and terrible God, keeping covenant and loving-kindness with them that love him, and that keep his commandments:
\[5]we have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from thy commandments and from thine ordinances.
\[6]And we have not hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, who spoke in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
\[7]Thine, O Lord, is the righteousness, but unto us confusion of face, as at this day, to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, in all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their unfaithfulness in which they have been unfaithful against thee.
\[8]O Lord, unto us is confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
\[9]With the Lord our God are mercies and pardons, for we have rebelled against him;
\[10]and we have not hearkened unto the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us through his servants the prophets.
\[11]And all Israel have transgressed thy law, even turning aside so as not to listen unto thy voice. And the curse hath been poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God: for we have sinned against him.
\[12]And he hath performed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; so that there hath not been done under the whole heaven as hath been done upon Jerusalem.
\[13]As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us; yet we besought not Jehovah our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.
\[14]And Jehovah hath watched over the evil, and brought it upon us; for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works which he hath done; and we have not hearkened unto his voice.
\[15]—And now, O Lord our God, who broughtest thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand, and hast made thee a name, as it is this day,—we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
\[16]Lord, according to all thy righteousnesses, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; for because of our sins, and because of the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people [are become] a reproach to all round about us.
\[17]And now, our God, hearken to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.
\[18]Incline thine ear, O my God, and hear; open thine eyes and behold our desolations, and the city that is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee because of our righteousnesses, but because of thy manifold mercies.
\[19]Lord, hear! Lord, forgive! Lord, hearken and do! defer not, for thine own sake, O my God! for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.
\[20]And whilst I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God;
\[21]whilst I was yet speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, flying swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.
\[22]And he informed [me], and talked with me, and said, Daniel, I am now come forth to make thee skilful of understanding.
\[23]At the beginning of thy supplications the word went forth, and I am come to declare [it]; for thou art one greatly beloved. Therefore consider the word, and have understanding in the vision:
\[24]Seventy weeks are apportioned out upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to close the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make expiation for iniquity, and to bring in the righteousness of the ages, and to seal the vision and prophet, and to anoint the holy of holies.
\[25]Know therefore and understand: From the going forth of the word to restore and to build Jerusalem unto Messiah, the Prince, are seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks. The street and the moat shall be built again, even in troublous times.
\[26]And after the sixty-two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, and shall have nothing; and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with an overflow, and unto the end, war,—the desolations determined.
\[27]And he shall confirm a covenant with the many [for] one week; and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and because of the protection of abominations [there shall be] a desolator, even until that the consumption and what is determined shall be poured out upon the desolate.

n the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing is true, but the appointed time of trial is long; and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.
\[2]In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks:
\[3]I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three full weeks were fulfilled.
\[4]And on the four-and-twentieth day of the first month, I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel:
\[5]and I lifted up mine eyes and looked, and behold, a certain man clothed in linen, and his loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz;
\[6]and his body was like a chrysolite, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as torches of fire, and his arms and his feet as the look of burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.
\[7]And I Daniel alone saw the vision; and the men that were with me saw not the vision, but a great quaking fell on them, and they fled to hide themselves.
\[8]And I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; and my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.
\[9]And I heard the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, I fell into a deep stupor on my face, and my face to the ground.
\[10]And behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and the palms of my hands.
\[11]And he said unto me, O Daniel, man greatly beloved, understand the words which I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for unto thee am I now sent. And as he spoke this word unto me, I stood trembling.
\[12]And he said unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come because of thy words.
\[13]But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; and behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.
\[14]And I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people at the end of the days: for the vision is yet for [many] days.
\[15]And as he was speaking with me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.
\[16]And behold, one after the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips; and I opened my mouth and spoke, and said unto him that stood before me, My lord, by reason of the vision my pains are turned upon me, and I retain no strength.
\[17]And how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remaineth no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.
\[18]Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me;
\[19]and he said, Fear not, man greatly beloved; peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And as he was speaking with me I was strengthened, and I said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.
\[20]And he said, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? And now I return to fight with the prince of Persia; and when I go forth, behold, the prince of Greece shall come.
\[21]However, I will declare unto thee that which is set down in the scripture of truth; and there is not one that sheweth himself strong with me against these, but Michael your prince.

nd I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood to confirm and to strengthen him.
\[2]And now will I declare unto thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall enrich himself with great riches more than all; and when he hath become strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece.
\[3]And a mighty king shall stand up that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.
\[4]And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of the heavens; but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion wherewith he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside these.
\[5]And the king of the south, who is one of his princes, shall be strong; but [another] shall be stronger than he, and have dominion: his dominion shall be a great dominion.
\[6]And after the course of years they shall join affinity; and the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make equitable conditions: but she shall not retain the strength of her arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm; and she shall be given up, she and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in [those] times.
\[7]But out of a shoot from her roots shall one stand up in his place, who shall come to the army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shew himself mighty.
\[8]He shall also carry captive into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall subsist for more years than the king of the north;
\[9]and [the same] shall come into the realm of the king of the south, but shall return into his own land.
\[10]And his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces; and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through; and he shall return and carry the war even to his fortress.
\[11]And the king of the south shall be enraged, and shall come forth and fight with him, with the king of the north, who shall set forth a great multitude, but the multitude shall be given into his hand.
\[12]And when the multitude shall have been taken away, his heart shall be exalted; and he shall cast down myriads; but he shall not prevail.
\[13]For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former; and shall certainly come at the end of the times of years with a great army and with much substance.
\[14]And in those times shall many stand up against the king of the south; and the violent of thy people will exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.
\[15]And the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mound, and take the well-fenced city; and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, for there shall be no strength to withstand.
\[16]And he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the land of beauty, and destruction shall be in his hand.
\[17]And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; and he shall practise; and he shall give him the daughter of women, to corrupt her; but she shall not stand, neither shall she be for him.
\[18]And he shall turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many; but a captain for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease: he shall turn it upon him, without reproach for himself.
\[19]And he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land; and he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.
\[20]And in his place shall one stand up who shall cause the exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom; but in a few days he shall be broken, neither in anger nor in battle.
\[21]And in his place shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom; but he shall come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
\[22]And the overflowing forces shall be overflowed from before him, and shall be broken: yea, also the prince of the covenant.
\[23]And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully, and he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.
\[24]In time of peace shall he enter even into the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers: he shall scatter among them prey, and spoil, and substance, and he shall plan his devices against the fortified places, even for a time.
\[25]And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall engage in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army; but he shall not stand, for they shall plan devices against him.
\[26]And they that eat of his delicate food shall break him, and his army shall be dissolved; and many shall fall down slain.
\[27]And both these kings' hearts [shall meditate] mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.
\[28]And he shall return into his land with great substance; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall practise, and return to his own land.
\[29]At the set time he shall return, and come towards the south; but not as the former time shall be the latter;
\[30]for ships of Chittim shall come against him; and he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant; and will practise; and he shall return and direct his attention to those that forsake the holy covenant.
\[31]And forces shall stand on his part, and they shall profane the sanctuary, the fortress, and shall take away the continual [sacrifice], and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.
\[32]And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries; but the people that know their God shall be strong, and shall act.
\[33]And they that are wise among the people shall instruct the many; and they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, [many] days.
\[34]And when they fall, they shall be helped with a little help; but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.
\[35]And [some] of the wise shall fall, to try them, and to purge and to make them white, to the time of the end: for it shall yet be for the time appointed.
\[36]And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and speak monstrous things against the God of gods; and he shall prosper until the indignation be accomplished: for that which is determined shall be done.
\[37]And he will not regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women; nor regard any +god: for he will magnify himself above all.
\[38]And in his place will he honour the +god of fortresses; and a +god whom his fathers knew not will he honour with gold and silver, and with precious stones and pleasant things.
\[39]And he will practise in the strongholds of fortresses with a strange +god: whoso acknowledgeth him will he increase with glory; and he shall cause them to rule over the many, and shall divide the land [to them] for a reward.
\[40]And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him; and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and overflow and pass through.
\[41]And he shall enter into the land of beauty, and many [countries] shall be overthrown; but these shall escape out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.
\[42]And he shall stretch forth his hand upon the countries; and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
\[43]And he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.
\[44]But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him; and he shall go forth with great fury to exterminate, and utterly to destroy many.
\[45]And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the mountain of holy beauty; and he shall come to his end, and there shall be none to help him.

he word of Jehovah that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
\[2]The beginning of the word of Jehovah through Hosea. And Jehovah said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms, and children of whoredoms; for the land is entirely given up to whoredom, away from Jehovah.
\[3]And he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived and bore him a son.
\[4]And Jehovah said unto him, Call his name Jizreel; for yet a little, and I will visit the blood of Jizreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.
\[5]And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jizreel.
\[6]And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And he said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah; for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel, so that I should pardon them.
\[7]But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by Jehovah their God; and I will not save them by bow, or by sword, or by battle, [or] by horses, or by horsemen.
\[8]And she weaned Lo-ruhamah; and she conceived and bore a son;
\[9]and he said, Call his name Lo-ammi; for ye are not my people, and I will not be for you.
\[10]Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea which cannot be measured or numbered; and it shall come to pass, [that] in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, it shall be said unto them, Sons of the living God.
\[11]And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up out of the land: for great is the day of Jizreel.

\[2]Plead with your mother, plead; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: and let her put away her whoredoms from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts;
\[3]lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her as a dry land, and slay her with thirst.
\[4]And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they are the children of whoredoms.
\[5]For their mother hath played the harlot; she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give [me] my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.
\[6]Therefore behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns; and I will fence [her] in with a wall, that she shall not find her paths.
\[7]And she shall pursue after her lovers, and shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, and shall not find them: and she shall say, I will go and return to my first husband, for then was it better with me than now.
\[8]And she did not know that I had given her the corn and the new wine and the oil, and had multiplied to her the silver and gold, which they employed for Baal.
\[9]Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my new wine in its season, and will withdraw my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.
\[10]And now will I discover her impiety in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.
\[11]And I will cause all her mirth to cease: her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths! and all her solemnities.
\[12]And I will make desolate her vine and her fig-tree, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards which my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
\[13]And I will visit upon her the days of the Baals, wherein she burned incense to them, and decked herself with her rings and jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, saith Jehovah.
\[14]Therefore behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak to her heart.
\[15]And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
\[16]And it shall be in that day, saith Jehovah, [that] thou shalt call me, My husband, and shalt call me no more, Baali;
\[17]for I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.
\[18]And I will make a covenant for them in that day with the beasts of the field, and with the fowl of the heavens, and the creeping things of the ground; and I will break bow and sword and battle out of the land; and I will make them to lie down safely.
\[19]And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; and I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies;
\[20]and I will betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know Jehovah.
\[21]And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith Jehovah, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;
\[22]and the earth shall hear the corn, and the new wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jizreel.
\[23]And I will sow her unto me in the land; and I will have mercy upon Lo-ruhamah; and I will say to Lo-ammi, Thou art my people; and they shall say, My God.

\[3]For this shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowl of the heavens, yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.

\[5]And thou shalt stumble by day; and the prophet also shall stumble with thee by night: and I will destroy thy mother.
\[6]My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; for thou hast rejected knowledge, and I will reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me; seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.
\[7]As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.
\[8]They eat the sin of my people, and their soul longeth for their iniquity.
\[9]And it shall be as the people so the priest; and I will visit their ways upon them, and recompense to them their doings;
\[10]and they shall eat, and not have enough; they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: for they have left off taking heed to Jehovah.
\[11]Fornication, and wine, and new wine take away the heart.
\[12]My people ask counsel of their stock, and their staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of whoredoms causeth [them] to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God:
\[13]they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oak and poplar and terebinth, because the shade thereof is good; therefore your daughters play the harlot and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.
\[14]I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot, nor your daughters-in-law for their committing adultery; for they themselves go aside with harlots, and they sacrifice with prostitutes: and the people that doth not understand shall come to ruin.
\[15]Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, let not Judah trespass; and come ye not unto Gilgal, neither go up to Beth-aven, nor swear [As] Jehovah liveth!
\[16]For Israel is refractory as an untractable heifer; now will Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a wide [pasture].

\[13]When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his sore, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb; but he was unable to heal you, nor hath he removed your sore.

\[4]What shall I do unto thee, Ephraim? What shall I do unto thee, Judah? For your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that early passeth away.
\[5]Therefore have I hewed [them] by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and my judgment goeth forth as the light.
\[6]For I delight in loving-kindness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.
\[7]But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
\[8]Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity; it is tracked with blood.
\[9]And as troops of robbers lie in wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way of Shechem; yea, they commit lewdness.
\[10]In the house of Israel have I seen a horrible thing: the whoredom of Ephraim is there; Israel is defiled.

\[2]And they say not in their hearts [that] I remember all their wickedness: now do their own doings encompass them; they are before my face.
\[3]They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.
\[4]They all practise adultery, as an oven heated by the baker: he ceaseth from stirring [the fire] after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.
\[5]In the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine: he stretched out his hand to scorners.
\[6]For they have applied their heart like an oven to their lying in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth like a flaming fire.
\[7]They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.

\[13]Woe unto them! for they have wandered from me; destruction unto them! for they have transgressed against me. And I would redeem them; but they speak lies against me.
\[14]And they cried not unto me in their heart, when they howled upon their beds; they assemble themselves for corn and new wine; they have turned aside from me.

\[13]They sacrifice flesh [for] the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; Jehovah hath no delight in them. Now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.

\[5]Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine: for it is cut off from your mouth.
\[6]For a nation is come up upon my land, strong and without number: his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a lioness.
\[7]He hath made my vine a desolation, and barked my fig-tree; he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away: its branches are made white.
\[8]Wail like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
\[9]The oblation and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of Jehovah; the priests, Jehovah's ministers, mourn.
\[10]The field is laid waste, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.
\[11]Be ashamed, ye husbandmen; howl, ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley: because the harvest of the field hath perished.
\[12]The vine is dried up, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm also and the apple-tree; all the trees of the field are withered, yea, joy is withered away from the children of men.
\[13]Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests; howl, ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the oblation and the drink-offering are withholden from the house of your God.
\[14]Hallow a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly, gather the elders, [and] all the inhabitants of the land to the house of Jehovah your God, and cry unto Jehovah.

\[18]How do the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are bewildered, for they have no pasture; the flocks of sheep also are in suffering.

\[11]And Jehovah uttereth his voice before his army; for his camp is very great; for strong is he that executeth his word: for the day of Jehovah is great and very terrible; and who can bear it?
\[12]Yet even now, saith Jehovah, turn to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning;
\[13]and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto Jehovah your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great loving-kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.

\[15]Blow the trumpet in Zion, hallow a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly;
\[16]gather the people, hallow the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride from her closet.
\[17]Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare, O Jehovah, thy people, and give not thine inheritance to reproach, that they should be a byword of the nations. Wherefore should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?
\[18]Then Jehovah will be jealous for his land, and will have pity on his people.

\[20]And I will remove far off from you him [that cometh] from the north, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, his face toward the eastern sea, and his rear toward the hinder sea; and his stench shall come up, and his ill odour shall come up, for he hath exalted himself to do great things.
\[21]—Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for Jehovah doeth great things.
\[22]Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring; for the tree beareth its fruit; the fig-tree and the vine yield full increase.
\[23]And ye, children of Zion, be glad and rejoice in Jehovah your God; for he giveth you the early rain in due measure, and he causeth to come down for you the rain, the early rain, and the latter rain at the beginning [of the season].
\[24]And the floors shall be full of corn, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.
\[25]And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you.
\[26]And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of Jehovah your God, who hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.
\[27]And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I, Jehovah, [am] your God, and there is none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.
\[28]And it shall come to pass afterwards [that] I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.
\[29]Yea, even upon the bondmen and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.
\[30]And I will shew wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
\[31]The sun shall be changed to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah come.

\[3]For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left, for the house of Israel.
\[4]For thus saith Jehovah unto the house of Israel: Seek ye me, and ye shall live.
\[5]And seek not Bethel, neither go to Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba; for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.
\[6]Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour [it], and there be none to quench [it] in Bethel.
\[7]Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth,
\[8][seek him] that made the Pleiades and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night; that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: Jehovah is his name.
\[9]He causeth destruction to break forth suddenly upon the strong, and bringeth destruction upon the fortress.
\[10]They hate him that reproveth in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.
\[11]Forasmuch, therefore, as ye trample upon the poor, and take from him presents of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, and ye shall not drink the wine of them.
\[12]For I know how manifold are your transgressions and your sins mighty: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside [the right of] the needy in the gate.
\[13]Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in this time; for it is an evil time.
\[14]Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live; and so Jehovah, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye say.
\[15]Hate evil, and love good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.
\[16]Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the Lord: Wailing shall be in all broadways; and they shall say in all the streets, Alas! alas! And they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.
\[17]And in all vineyards shall be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.
\[18]Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah! To what end is the day of Jehovah for you? It shall be darkness and not light:
\[19]as if a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.
\[20]Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?
\[21]I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will not smell [a sweet odour] in your solemn assemblies.
\[22]For if ye offer up unto me burnt-offerings and your oblations, I will not accept [them]; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fatted beasts.
\[23]Take away from me the noise of thy songs, and I will not hear the melody of thy lutes;
\[24]but let judgment roll down as waters, and righteousness as an ever-flowing stream.
\[25]Did ye bring unto me sacrifices and oblations in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?
\[26]Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of your Moloch, and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye had made to yourselves;

\[13]But prophesy not again any more at Bethel; for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is the house of the kingdom.
\[14]And Amos answered and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was a herdman, and a gatherer of sycamore fruit.
\[15]And Jehovah took me as I followed the flock, and Jehovah said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.

\[4]Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith Jehovah.

\[6]How is Esau searched! his hidden things sought out!
\[7]All the men of thy confederacy have pushed thee to the border; the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, they have prevailed against thee; [they that eat] thy bread have laid a snare under thee. There is no understanding in him.

\[9]And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one may be cut off from the mount of Esau by slaughter.
\[10]Because of violence against thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.
\[11]In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away captive his substance, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.
\[12]But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day of his disaster; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; nor have opened wide thy mouth in the day of distress.
\[13]Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity, nor have looked, even thou, on their affliction in the day of their calamity, neither shouldest thou have laid [hands] on their substance in the day of their calamity;
\[14]and thou shouldest not have stood on the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape, nor have delivered up those remaining of him in the day of distress.
\[15]For the day of Jehovah is near upon all the nations: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy recompence shall return upon thine own head.
\[16]For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the nations drink continually; yea, they shall drink, and shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.
\[17]But upon mount Zion shall there be deliverance, and it shall be holy; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.
\[18]And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble; and they shall kindle in them and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau: for Jehovah hath spoken [it].

\[7]But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered.
\[8]And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, so that he fainted; and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.

\[2]Hear, ye peoples, all of you; hearken, O earth, and all that is therein: and let the Lord Jehovah be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple!
\[3]For behold, Jehovah cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.
\[4]And the mountains shall be melted under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters poured down a steep place.
\[5]For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. Whence is the transgression of Jacob? is it not [from] Samaria? And whence are the high places of Judah? are they not [from] Jerusalem?
\[6]Therefore will I make Samaria as a heap of the field, as plantings of a vineyard; and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will lay bare the foundations thereof.
\[7]And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her harlot-gifts shall be burned with fire, and all her idols will I make a desolation; for of the hire of a harlot hath she gathered [them], and to a harlot's hire shall they return.
\[8]For this will I lament, and I will howl; I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the jackals, and mourning like the ostriches.
\[9]For her wounds are incurable; for it is come even unto Judah, it reacheth unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
\[10]Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all; at Beth-le-aphrah roll thyself in the dust.
\[11]Pass away, inhabitress of Shaphir, in nakedness [and] shame. The inhabitress of Zaanan is not come forth for the lamentation of Beth-ezel: he will take from you its shelter.
\[12]For the inhabitress of Maroth waited anxiously for good; but evil hath come down from Jehovah unto the gate of Jerusalem.
\[13]Bind the chariot to the swift steed, O inhabitress of Lachish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; for in thee were found the transgressions of Israel.
\[14]Therefore shalt thou give parting-gifts to Moresheth-Gath: the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.
\[15]I will yet bring unto thee an heir, O inhabitress of Mareshah; the glory of Israel shall come even unto Adullam.

\[2]And Jehovah answered me and said, Write the vision, and engrave it upon tablets, that he may run that readeth it.
\[3]For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but it hasteth to the end, and shall not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; for it will surely come, it will not delay.
\[4]Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright within him: but the just shall live by his faith.
\[5]And moreover, the wine is treacherous: he is a proud man, and keepeth not at rest, he enlargeth his desire as Sheol, and he is like death and cannot be satisfied; and he assembleth unto him all nations, and gathereth unto him all peoples.
\[6]Shall not all these take up a proverb about him, and a taunting riddle against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long?—and to him that loadeth himself with pledges!
\[7]Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and they awake up that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?
\[8]Because thou hast plundered many nations, all the rest of the peoples shall plunder thee; because of men's blood, and for the violence [done] to the land, to the city, and all that dwell therein.
\[9]Woe to him that getteth iniquitous gain to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the grasp of evil!
\[10]Thou hast devised shame to thy house, by cutting off many peoples, and hast sinned against thine own soul.
\[11]For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
\[12]Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by unrighteousness!
\[13]Behold, is it not of Jehovah of hosts that the peoples labour for the fire, and the nations weary themselves in vain?
\[14]For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.
\[15]Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink,—that pourest out thy flask, and makest [him] drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!
\[16]Thou art filled with shame instead of glory; drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of Jehovah's right hand shall be turned unto thee, and a shameful spewing shall be on thy glory.
\[17]For the violence [done] to Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of beasts which made them afraid; because of men's blood, and for the violence [done] to the land, to the city, and all that dwell therein.
\[18]What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it? the molten image, and the teacher of falsehood, that the maker of his work dependeth thereon, to make dumb idols?
\[19]Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake! to the dumb stone, Arise! Shall it teach? Behold it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.

 Prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.
\[2]Jehovah, I heard the report of thee, [and] I feared. Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years, In the midst of the years make [it] known: In wrath remember mercy!
\[3]+God came from Teman, And the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covereth the heavens, And the earth is full of his praise.
\[4]And [his] brightness was as the light; Rays [came forth] from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power.
\[5]Before him went the pestilence, And a burning flame went forth at his feet.
\[6]He stood, and measured the earth; He beheld, and discomfited the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered, The everlasting hills gave way: His ways are everlasting.
\[7]I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
\[8]Was Jehovah wrathful with the rivers? Was thine anger against the rivers? Was thy rage against the sea, That thou didst ride upon thy horses, Thy chariots of salvation?
\[9]Thy bow was made naked, The rods [of discipline] sworn according to [thy] word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
\[10]The mountains saw thee, they were in travail: Torrents of waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, Lifted up its hands on high.
\[11]The sun [and] moon stood still in their habitation, At the light of thine arrows which shot forth,—At the shining of thy glittering spear.
\[12]Thou didst march through the land in indignation, Thou didst thresh the nations in anger.
\[13]Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, For the salvation of thine anointed; Thou didst smite off the head from the house of the wicked, Laying bare the foundation even to the neck. Selah.
\[14]Thou didst strike through with his own spears the head of his leaders: They came out as a whirlwind to scatter me, Whose exulting was as to devour the afflicted secretly.
\[15]Thou didst walk through the sea with thy horses, The heap of great waters.
\[16]I heard, and my belly trembled; My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in my place, That I might rest in the day of distress, When their invader shall come up against the people.
\[17]For though the fig-tree shall not blossom, Neither shall fruit be in the vines; The labour of the olive-tree shall fail, And the fields shall yield no food; The flock shall be cut off from the fold, And there shall be no herd in the stalls:
\[18]Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my salvation.
\[19]Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength, And he maketh my feet like hinds' [feet], And he will make me to walk upon my high places. To the chief Musician. On my stringed instruments.

he word of Jehovah that came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.
\[2]I will utterly take away everything from off the face of the ground, saith Jehovah:
\[3]I will take away man and beast; I will take away the fowl of the heavens and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling-blocks with the wicked, and I will cut off mankind from off the face of the ground, saith Jehovah.
\[4]And I will stretch forth my hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, the name of the Chemarim with the priests;
\[5]and them that bow down to the host of the heavens upon the housetops; and them that bow down to Jehovah, that swear by [him], and swear by Malcham;
\[6]and them that turn back from after Jehovah, and that do not seek Jehovah, nor inquire for him.
\[7]Be silent at the presence of the Lord Jehovah; for the day of Jehovah is at hand; for Jehovah hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath hallowed his guests.
\[8]And it shall come to pass in the day of Jehovah's sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's sons, and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel.
\[9]And in that day will I punish all those that leap over the threshold, who fill their master's house with violence and deceit.
\[10]And in that day, saith Jehovah, there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish-gate, and a howling from the second [quarter], and a great crashing from the hills.
\[11]Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh; for all the people of Canaan are cut down, all they that are laden with silver are cut off.
\[12]And it shall come to pass at that time, [that] I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and punish the men that are settled on their lees, that say in their heart, Jehovah will not do good, neither will he do evil.
\[13]And their wealth shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation; and they shall build houses, and not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and not drink the wine thereof.
\[14]The great day of Jehovah is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly. The voice of the day of Jehovah: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.
\[15]That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of ruin and desolation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and gross darkness,
\[16]a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fenced cities and against the high battlements.
\[17]And I will bring distress upon men, and they shall walk like blind men; for they have sinned against Jehovah; and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung:
\[18]their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them, in the day of Jehovah's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for a full end, yea, a sudden [end], shall he make of all them that dwell in the land.

\[7]And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for Jehovah their God shall visit them, and turn again their captivity.
\[8]I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.
\[9]Therefore, [as] I live, saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Moab shall certainly be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and salt-pits, and a perpetual desolation; the remnant of my people shall spoil them, and the residue of my nation shall possess them.
\[10]This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of hosts.

\[12]Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be the slain of my sword.
\[13]And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, a place of drought like the wilderness.
\[14]And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the crowd of beasts; both the pelican and the bittern shall lodge in the chapiters thereof; a voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be on the thresholds: for he hath laid bare the cedar work.
\[15]This is the rejoicing city that dwelt in security, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none else beside me: how is she become a desolation, a couching-place for beasts! Every one that passeth by her shall hiss, shall wave his hand.

\[2]She hearkened not to the voice; she received not correction; she confided not in Jehovah; she drew not near her God.

\[4]Her prophets are vain-glorious, treacherous persons; her priests profane the sanctuary, they do violence to the law.

\[9]For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him with one consent.

\[12]And I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of Jehovah.
\[13]The remnant of Israel shall not work unrighteousness, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: but *they* shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
\[14]Exult, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; rejoice and be glad with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem:
\[15]Jehovah hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy; the King of Israel, Jehovah, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not see evil any more.
\[16]In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear not; Zion, let not thy hands be slack.
\[17]Jehovah thy God is in thy midst, a mighty one that will save: he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will exult over thee with singing.
\[18]I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assemblies, who were of thee: the reproach of it was a burden [unto them].
\[19]Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee; and I will save her that halted, and gather her that was driven out; and I will make them a praise and a name in all the lands where they have been put to shame.
\[20]At that time will I bring you, yea, at the time that I gather you; for I will make you a name and a praise, among all the peoples of the earth, when I shall turn again your captivity before your eyes, saith Jehovah.

\[2]Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that Jehovah's house should be built.
\[3]And the word of Jehovah came by Haggai the prophet, saying,
\[4]Is it time for you that ye should dwell in your wainscoted houses, while this house lieth waste?
\[5]And now thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways.
\[6]Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but are not satisfied; ye drink, but are not filled with drink; ye clothe yourselves, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages for a bag with holes.
\[7]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways.
\[8]Go up to the mountain and bring wood, and build the house, and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith Jehovah.
\[9]Ye looked for much, and behold it was little; and when ye brought it home, I blew upon it. Wherefore? saith Jehovah of hosts. Because of my house that lieth waste, whilst ye run every man to his own house.
\[10]Therefore over you the heavens withhold their dew, and the earth withholdeth its fruit.
\[11]And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon man, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.
\[12]And Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all the remnant of the people, hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, according as Jehovah their God had sent him, and the people feared before Jehovah.
\[13]Then spoke Haggai, Jehovah's messenger, in Jehovah's message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith Jehovah.
\[14]And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked at the house of Jehovah of hosts, their God,

\[2]Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
\[3]Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? and how do ye see it now? Is it not as nothing in your eyes?
\[4]But now be strong, Zerubbabel, saith Jehovah; and be strong, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith Jehovah, and work: for I am with you, saith Jehovah of hosts.

\[6]For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry [land];
\[7]and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory, saith Jehovah of hosts.
\[8]The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith Jehovah of hosts.
\[9]The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, saith Jehovah of hosts; and in this place will I give peace, saith Jehovah of hosts.
\[10]On the four and twentieth [day] of the ninth [month], in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying,
\[11]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ask now the priests [concerning] the law, saying,
\[12]If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food—shall it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
\[13]And Haggai said, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, is it become unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.
\[14]Then answered Haggai and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith Jehovah, and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.
\[15]And now, I pray you, consider from this day and onward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of Jehovah,
\[16]—before those [days] were, when one came to a heap of twenty [measures], there were but ten; when one came to the vat to draw out fifty press-measures, there were but twenty.
\[17]I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands; and ye [turned] not to me, saith Jehovah.
\[18]Consider, I pray you, from this day and onward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth [month], from the day that the foundation of Jehovah's temple was laid, consider [it].
\[19]Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree have not brought forth: from this day will I bless [you].
\[20]And the word of Jehovah came the second time unto Haggai on the four and twentieth [day] of the month, saying,
\[21]Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;
\[22]and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride therein; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.
\[23]In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, will I take thee, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, my servant, saith Jehovah, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee, saith Jehovah of hosts.

\[12]And the angel of Jehovah answered and said, Jehovah of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these seventy years?
\[13]And Jehovah answered the angel that talked with me good words, comforting words.
\[14]And the angel that talked with me said unto me, Cry, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy,
\[15]and I am wroth exceedingly with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little wroth, and they helped forward the affliction.

\[4]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each one with his staff in his hand for multitude of days.
\[5]And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.
\[6]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If it be wonderful in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be wonderful in mine eyes? saith Jehovah of hosts.

\[8]and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.
\[9]Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, that were in the day that the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.
\[10]For before those days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; and there was no peace for him that went out or that came in, because of the distress: for I let loose all men, every one against his neighbour.

\[16]These are the things that ye shall do: Speak truth every one with his neighbour; execute truth and the judgment of peace in your gates;

\[7]Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible.
\[8]And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? Present it now unto thy governor: will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith Jehovah of hosts.

\[13]And further ye do this: ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that he regardeth not the oblation any more, nor receiveth [it] with satisfaction at your hand.

\[15]And did not one make [them]? and the remnant of the Spirit was his. And wherefore the one? He sought a seed of God. Take heed then to your spirit, and let none deal unfaithfully against the wife of his youth,
\[16](for I hate putting away, saith Jehovah the God of Israel;) and he covereth with violence his garment, saith Jehovah of hosts: take heed then to your spirit, that ye deal not unfaithfully.
\[17]Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words, and ye say, Wherein have we wearied [him]? In that ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of Jehovah, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?

ehold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me; and the Lord whom ye seek will suddenly come to his temple, and the Angel of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he cometh, saith Jehovah of hosts.
\[2]But who shall endure the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? For he will be like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' lye.
\[3]And he shall sit [as] a refiner and purifier of silver; and he will purify the children of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah an oblation in righteousness.
\[4]Then shall the oblation of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in former years.
\[5]And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the false swearers, and against those that oppress the hired servant in [his] wages, the widow and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger [from his right], and fear not me, saith Jehovah of hosts.
\[6]For I Jehovah change not, and ye, sons of Jacob, are not consumed.
\[7]Since the days of your fathers have ye departed from my statutes, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts. But ye say, Wherein shall we return?
\[8]Will a man rob God? But ye rob me. And ye say, Wherein do we rob thee? [In] tithes and heave-offerings.
\[9]Ye are cursed with a curse; and me ye rob, [even] this whole nation.
\[10]Bring the whole tithe into the treasure-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I open not to you the windows of the heavens, and pour you out a blessing, till there be no place for it.
\[11]And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, saith Jehovah of hosts.
\[12]And all nations shall call you blessed; for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith Jehovah of hosts.
\[13]Your words have been stout against me, saith Jehovah; but ye say, What have we been speaking against thee?
\[14]Ye say, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we keep his charge, and that we walk mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?
\[15]And now we hold the proud for happy; yea, they that work wickedness are built up; yea, they tempt God, and they escape.
\[16]Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another; and Jehovah observed [it], and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name.
\[17]And they shall be unto me a peculiar treasure, saith Jehovah of hosts, in the day that I prepare; and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.
\[18]And ye shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.

or behold, the day cometh, burning as a furnace; and all the proud and all that work wickedness shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith Jehovah of hosts, so that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
\[2]And unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth and leap like fatted calves.
\[3]And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I prepare, saith Jehovah of hosts.
\[4]Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, the statutes and ordinances.
\[5]Behold, I send unto you Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and terrible day of Jehovah.
\[6]And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
