n the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
\[2]And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
\[3]And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.
\[4]And God saw the light, that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness.
\[5]And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.
\[6]And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
\[7]And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so.
\[8]And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.
\[9]And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear. And it was so.
\[10]And God called the dry land Earth, and he called the gathering together of the waters Seas. And God saw that it was good.
\[11]And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit according to their kind (in which is the seed of them) upon the earth. And it was so.
\[12]And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed according to their kind, and trees bearing fruit in which is the seed of it, according to their kind. And God saw that it was good.
\[13]And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.
\[14]And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years.
\[15]And let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth. And it was so.
\[16]And God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, also the stars.
\[17]And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,
\[18]and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
\[19]And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
\[20]And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
\[21]And God created the great sea creatures, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
\[22]And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.
\[23]And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
\[24]And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth according to their kind. And it was so.
\[25]And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kind, and the cattle according to their kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
\[26]And God said, Let us make mankind in our image-after our likeness-and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.
\[27]And God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created him, male and female he created them.
\[28]And God blessed them. And God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and have power over it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.
\[29]And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed. To you it shall be for food,
\[30]and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creeps upon the earth in which there is life, for food-every green herb. And it was so.
\[31]And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

nd the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
\[2]And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
\[3]And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it, because in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.
\[4]These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.
\[5]And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up, for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth. And there was not a man to till the ground,
\[6]but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
\[7]And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.
\[8]And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed.
\[9]And out of the ground Jehovah God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food, also the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
\[10]And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it was divided, and became four heads.
\[11]The name of the first is Pishon. That is it which encompasses the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
\[12]And the gold of that land is good. There is bdellium and the onyx stone.
\[13]And the name of the second river is Gihon. The same is it which encompasses the whole land of Cush.
\[14]And the name of the third river is Hiddekel. That is it which goes in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
\[15]And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
\[16]And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou may freely eat,
\[17]but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shall not eat of it. For in the day that thou eat of it thou shall surely die.
\[18]And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone, I will make a help meet for him.
\[19]And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them, and whatever the man called every living creature, that was the name of it.
\[20]And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field, but for man there was not found a help meet for him.
\[21]And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept. And God took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in place of it.
\[22]And the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, he made a woman, and brought her to the man.
\[23]And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
\[24]Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cling to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.
\[25]And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

ow the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said to the woman, Yea, has God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?
\[2]And the woman said to the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat,
\[3]but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, Ye shall not eat of it, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
\[4]And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die.
\[5]For God knows that in the day ye eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
\[6]And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make wise, she took of the fruit of it, and ate. And she also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.
\[7]And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
\[8]And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden.
\[9]And Jehovah God called to the man, and said to him, Where are thou?
\[10]And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked. And I hid myself.
\[11]And he said, Who told thee that thou was naked? Have thou eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee that thou should not eat?
\[12]And the man said, The woman whom thou gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.
\[13]And Jehovah God said to the woman, What is this thou have done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.
\[14]And Jehovah God said to the serpent, Because thou have done this, cursed are thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. Upon thy belly thou shall go, and dust thou shall eat all the days of thy life.
\[15]And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed. He shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his heel.
\[16]To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy childbearing, in pain thou shall bring forth children. And thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
\[17]And to Adam he said, Because thou have hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shall not eat of it, cursed is the ground for thy sake. In toil thou shall eat of it all the days of thy life.
\[18]Also, thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to thee, and thou shall eat the herb of the field.
\[19]In the sweat of thy face thou shall eat bread, till thou return to the ground, for out of it thou were taken. For thou are dust, and to dust thou shall return.
\[20]And the man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
\[21]And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.
\[22]And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man has become as one of us, to know good and evil, and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever-
\[23]therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from where he was taken.
\[24]So he drove out the man. And he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to guard the way of the tree of life.

\[2]And again she bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
\[3]And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought an offering to Jehovah of the fruit of the ground.
\[4]And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat of it. And Jehovah had respect to Abel and to his offering,
\[5]but he did not have respect to Cain and to his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.
\[6]And Jehovah said to Cain, Why are thou angry? And why has thy countenance fallen?
\[7]If thou do well, shall thou not be accepted? And if thou do not well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire shall be for thee, and thou shall rule over it.
\[8]And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and killed him.
\[9]And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not. Am I my brother's keeper?
\[10]And he said, What have thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood cries to me from the ground.
\[11]And now cursed are thou from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand.
\[12]When thou till the ground, it shall not henceforth yield to thee its strength. A fugitive and a wanderer thou shall be on the earth.
\[13]And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
\[14]Behold, thou have driven me out this day from the face of the ground, and I shall be hid from thy face, and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. And it shall come to pass, that whoever finds me shall slay me.
\[15]And Jehovah said to him, Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any who finds him should smite him.
\[16]And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
\[17]And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch. And Cain built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.
\[18]And to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.
\[19]And Lamech took to him two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
\[20]And Adah bore Jabal. He was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle.
\[21]And his brother's name was Jubal. He was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.
\[22]And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
\[23]And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech. For I have killed a man for wounding me, and a young man for bruising me.
\[24]If Cain shall be avenged seven fold, truly Lamech seventy-seven fold.
\[25]And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth. For, she said, God has appointed for me another seed instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.
\[26]And to Seth, to him also there was born a son, and he called his name Enosh. Then men began to call upon the name of Jehovah.

\[3]And Jehovah said, My Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he also is flesh. Yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.
\[4]The giants were on the earth in those days. And also after that, when the sons of God came to the daughters of men, and they bore sons to them, the same were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.
\[5]And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
\[6]And Jehovah regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart.
\[7]And Jehovah said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ground, from man, to beast, to creeping things, and birds of the heavens, for I regret that I have made them.
\[8]But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.
\[9]These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, perfect in his generations. Noah walked with God.
\[10]And Noah begot three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
\[11]And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
\[12]And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.
\[13]And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth is filled with violence through them, and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
\[14]Make thee an ark of gopher wood. Thou shall make rooms in the ark, and shall pitch it inside and outside with pitch.
\[15]And this is how thou shall make it: The length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
\[16]Thou shall make a light for the ark, and thou shall finish it to a cubit upward. And thou shall set the door of the ark in the side of it, with lower, second, and third stories thou shall make it.
\[17]And I, behold, I bring the flood of waters upon this earth, to destroy all flesh, in which is the breath of life, from under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall die.
\[18]But I will establish my covenant with thee. And thou shall come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
\[19]And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort thou shall bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee. They shall be male and female.

\[7]And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
\[8]Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps upon the ground,

\[12]And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

\[15]And they went in to Noah into the ark, two by two of all flesh in which is the breath of life.
\[16]And those that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him. And Jehovah shut him in.
\[17]And the flood was forty days upon the earth. And the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.
\[18]And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
\[19]And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered,
\[20]fifteen cubits upward. The waters prevailed, and the mountains were covered.
\[21]And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, from birds, to cattle, to beasts, and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth, and every man.
\[22]All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.
\[23]And every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground, from man, to cattle, to creeping things, and birds of the heavens, and they were destroyed from the earth. And only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark.

\[14]And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
\[15]And God spoke to Noah, saying,
\[16]Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.
\[17]Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both birds and cattle, and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth, that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.

\[19]Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves upon the earth, according to their families, went forth out of the ark.
\[20]And Noah built an altar to Jehovah, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
\[21]And Jehovah smelled the sweet savor. And Jehovah said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, for that the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I again any more smite everything living, as I have done.

\[3]Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. As the green herb, I have given you all.
\[4]But flesh with the life of it, which is the blood of it, ye shall not eat.
\[5]And surely your blood, the blood of your lives, I will require. At the hand of every beast I will require it. And at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, I will require the life of man.

\[10]and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth.

\[13]I set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth.
\[14]And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud.
\[15]And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh. And the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
\[16]And the bow shall be in the cloud, and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

\[2]The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
\[3]And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
\[4]And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
\[5]From these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands, every man according to his tongue, according to their families, in their nations.
\[6]And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.
\[7]And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.
\[8]And Cush begot Nimrod. He began to be a mighty man on the earth.
\[9]He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah. Therefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before Jehovah.
\[10]And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
\[11]He went forth out of that land into Assyria, and built Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah,
\[12]and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).
\[13]And Mizraim begot Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
\[14]and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (from where the Philistines went forth), and Caphtorim.
\[15]And Canaan begot Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,
\[16]and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,
\[17]and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
\[18]and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. And afterward the families of the Canaanite were spread abroad.
\[19]And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as thou go toward Gerar, to Gaza, as thou go toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, to Lasha.
\[20]These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.
\[21]And to Shem, the father of all the sons of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, sons were also born to him.
\[22]The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.
\[23]And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
\[24]And Arphaxad begot Shelah, and Shelah begot Eber.
\[25]And to Eber were born two sons. The name of the one was Peleg. For in his days the earth was divided. And his brother's name was Joktan.
\[26]And Joktan begot Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
\[27]and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
\[28]and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
\[29]and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan.
\[30]And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.
\[31]These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, according to their nations.
\[32]These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their generations, in their nations. And from these the nations were divided on the earth after the flood.

\[2]And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.
\[3]And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and they had slime for mortar.
\[4]And they said, Come, let us build a city for us, and a tower, and its top in the heavens. And let us make a name for us, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
\[5]And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the sons of men built.
\[6]And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is what they begin to do. And now nothing will be withheld from them, which they propose to do.
\[7]Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand each other's speech.
\[8]So Jehovah scattered them abroad from there upon the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.
\[9]Therefore the name of it was called Babel, because Jehovah there confounded the language of all the earth, and from there Jehovah scattered them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
\[10]These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begot Arphaxad two years after the flood.
\[11]And Shem lived five hundred years after he begot Arphaxad, and begot sons and daughters.
\[12]And Arphaxad lived a hundred and thirty-five years, and begot Cainan.
\[13]And Arphaxad lived after he had begotten Cainan, four hundred years, and begot sons and daughters, and died. And Cainan lived a hundred and thirty years and begot Shelah; and Cainan lived after he had begotten Shelah, three hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters, and died.
\[14]And Shelah lived thirty years, and begot Eber.
\[15]And Shelah lived four hundred and three years after he begot Eber, and begot sons and daughters.
\[16]And Eber lived thirty-four years, and begot Peleg.
\[17]And Eber lived four hundred and thirty years after he begot Peleg, and begot sons and daughters.

\[19]And Peleg lived two hundred and nine years after he begot Reu, and begot sons and daughters.
\[20]And Reu lived thirty-two years, and begot Serug.
\[21]And Reu lived two hundred and seven years after he begot Serug, and begot sons and daughters.
\[22]And Serug lived thirty years, and begot Nahor.
\[23]And Serug lived two hundred years after he begot Nahor, and begot sons and daughters.
\[24]And Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and begot Terah.
\[25]And Nahor lived a hundred and nineteen years after he begot Terah, and begot sons and daughters.
\[26]And Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
\[27]Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran begot Lot.
\[28]And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
\[29]And Abram and Nahor took wives to themselves. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
\[30]And Sarai was barren; she had no child.
\[31]And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife. And they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. And they came to Haran, and dwelt there.
\[32]And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran.

\[3]And I will bless those who bless thee, and he who curses thee I will curse. And in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
\[4]So Abram went as Jehovah had spoken to him, and Lot went with him. And Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran.
\[5]And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran, and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan. And they came into the land of Canaan.
\[6]And Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
\[7]And Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said, I will give this land to thy seed. And there he built an altar to Jehovah, who appeared to him.
\[8]And he moved from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to Jehovah, and called upon the name of Jehovah.
\[9]And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.
\[10]And there was a famine in the land. And Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.
\[11]And it came to pass, when he came near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou are a fair woman to look upon.
\[12]And it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife. And they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
\[13]Say, I pray thee, thou are my sister, that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.
\[14]And it came to pass, that, when Abram came into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
\[15]And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
\[16]And he dealt well with Abram for her sake. And he had sheep, and oxen, and he-donkeys, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-donkeys, and camels.
\[17]And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
\[18]And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou have done to me? Why did thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
\[19]Why did thou say, She is my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore behold thy wife. Take her, and go thy way.

\[2]And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
\[3]And he went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
\[4]to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. And Abram called on the name of Jehovah there.
\[5]And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
\[6]And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together. For their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
\[7]And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle. And the Canaanite and the Perizzite then dwelt in the land.
\[8]And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen, for we are brothers.
\[9]Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. If the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if the right hand, then I will go to the left.
\[10]And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the Plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere (before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah) like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as thou go to Zoar.
\[11]So Lot chose for himself all the Plain of the Jordan. And Lot journeyed east, and they separated themselves the one from the other.
\[12]Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan. And Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
\[13]Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Jehovah.
\[14]And Jehovah said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou are, northward and southward and eastward and westward.
\[15]For all the land which thou see, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed forever.
\[16]And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth. So that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then may thy seed also be numbered.
\[17]Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it, for to thee I will give it.
\[18]And Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Jehovah.

\[11]And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way.
\[12]And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.

\[8]And I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojourning, all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.

\[11]And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be a sign of a covenant between me and you.
\[12]And he who is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations: he who is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner that is not of thy seed.
\[13]He who is born in thy house, and he who is bought with thy money, must be circumcised. And my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
\[14]And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.

\[19]For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice, to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him.

\[21]I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which comes to me. And if not, I will know.
\[22]And the men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham yet stood before Jehovah.
\[23]And Abraham drew near, and said, Will thou consume righteous men with wicked men?
\[24]Perhaps there are fifty righteous men within the city. Will thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous men that are in it?
\[25]That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay a righteous man with a wicked man, that so the righteous man should be as the wicked man. Far be it from thee. Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
\[26]And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous men within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.

\[28]Perhaps there shall lack five of the fifty righteous men. Will thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty-five.
\[29]And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Perhaps there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake.
\[30]And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Perhaps there shall be thirty found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
\[31]And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the Lord. Perhaps there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake.
\[32]And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once. Perhaps ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.
\[33]And Jehovah went his way as soon as he had left off conversing with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.

nd the two agents came to Sodom at evening, and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. And Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them. And he bowed himself with his face to the earth,
\[2]and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, No, but we will abide in the street all night.
\[3]And he urged them greatly. And they turned in to him, and entered into his house. And he made a feast for them, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
\[4]But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, encompassed the house around, both young and old, all the people from every quarter.
\[5]And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men who came in to thee this night? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.
\[6]And Lot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him.
\[7]And he said, I pray you, my brothers, do not so wickedly.
\[8]Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known a man. Let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes. Only do nothing to these men, inasmuch as they have come under the shadow of my roof.
\[9]And they said, Stand back. And they said, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will be a judge. Now we will deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed greatly upon the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door.
\[10]But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
\[11]And they smote the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
\[12]And the men said to Lot, Have thou here any besides? Son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomever thou have in the city, bring them out of the place.
\[13]For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them has been great before Jehovah. And Jehovah has sent us to destroy it.
\[14]And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place, for Jehovah will destroy the city. But he seemed to his sons-in-law as a man jesting.
\[15]And when the morning arose, then the agents hurried Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters who are here, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
\[16]But he lingered. And the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful to him, and they brought him forth, and set him outside the city.
\[17]And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life, do not look behind thee, neither stay thou in all the Plain. Escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
\[18]And Lot said to them, Oh, not so, my lord.
\[19]Behold now, thy servant has found favor in thy sight, and thou have magnified thy loving kindness, which thou have shown to me in saving my life, and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die.
\[20]Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (is it not a little one?), and my soul shall live.
\[21]And he said to him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou have spoken.
\[22]Hasten thee, escape there, for I cannot do anything till thou have come there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
\[23]The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
\[24]Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven.
\[25]And he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
\[26]But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
\[27]And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Jehovah.
\[28]And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the Plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.
\[29]And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.
\[30]And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him, for he feared to dwell in Zoar. And he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
\[31]And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man on the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.
\[32]Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed by our father.
\[33]And they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. And he did not know when she lay down, nor when she arose.
\[34]And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said to the younger, Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine this night also, and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed by our father.
\[35]And they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose, and lay with him. And he did not know when she lay down, nor when she arose.
\[36]Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father.
\[37]And the firstborn bore a son, and called his name Moab. The same is the father of the Moabites to this day.
\[38]And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi. The same is the father of the sons of Ammon to this day.

\[2]And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
\[3]But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, Behold, thou are but a dead man, because of the woman whom thou have taken, for she is a man's wife.
\[4]Now Abimelech had not come near her. And he said, Lord, will thou slay even a righteous nation?
\[5]Did he not himself say to me, She is my sister? And she, even she herself said, He is my brother. In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.
\[6]And God said to him in the dream, Yes, I know that in the integrity of thy heart thou have done this. And I also withheld thee from sinning against me. Therefore I did not allow thee to touch her.
\[7]Now therefore restore the man's wife. For he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shall live. And if thou do not restore her, know thou that thou shall surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
\[8]And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. And the men were exceedingly afraid.
\[9]Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What have thou done to us? And in what have I sinned against thee, that thou have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? Thou have done deeds to me that ought not to be done.
\[10]And Abimelech said to Abraham, What did thou see, that thou have done this thing?
\[11]And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.
\[12]And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.
\[13]And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This is thy kindness which thou shall show to me. At every place where we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
\[14]And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored to him Sarah his wife.
\[15]And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee. Dwell where it pleases thee.
\[16]And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all who are with thee. And in regard to all thou are righted.
\[17]And Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants. And they bore sons.
\[18]For Jehovah had closed up fast all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.

nd Jehovah visited Sarah as he had said, and Jehovah did to Sarah as he had spoken.
\[2]And Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
\[3]And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
\[4]And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
\[5]And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born to him.
\[6]And Sarah said, God has made me to laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me.
\[7]And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah should give sons suck? For I have borne him a son in his old age.
\[8]And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
\[9]And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.
\[10]Therefore she said to Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son. For the son of this handmaid shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
\[11]And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son.
\[12]And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy handmaid. In all that Sarah says to thee, hearken to her voice. For in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
\[13]And also I will make a nation of the son of the handmaid, because he is thy seed.
\[14]And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
\[15]And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
\[16]And she went, and sat herself down opposite him a good way off, as it were a bowshot. For she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child. And she sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.
\[17]And God heard the voice of the lad. And the agent of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, What troubles thee, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.
\[18]Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand, for I will make him a great nation.
\[19]And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
\[20]And God was with the lad, and he grew. And he dwelt in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer.
\[21]And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took for him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
\[22]And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou do.
\[23]Now therefore swear to me here by God that thou will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son. But according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shall do to me, and to the land in which thou have sojourned.
\[24]And Abraham said, I will swear.
\[25]And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water which Abimelech's servants had taken away violently.
\[26]And Abimelech said, I know not who has done this thing, neither did thou tell me, nor yet did I hear of it, but today.
\[27]And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech. And the two made a covenant.
\[28]And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
\[29]And Abimelech said to Abraham, What do these seven ewe lambs mean which thou have set by themselves?
\[30]And he said, These seven ewe lambs thou shall take from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.
\[31]Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because there they swore both of them.
\[32]So they made a covenant at Beersheba. And Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
\[33]And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there called on the name of Jehovah, the Everlasting God.

\[2]And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou love, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah. And offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
\[3]And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. And he split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.
\[4]On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
\[5]And Abraham said to his young men, Abide ye here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go yonder, and we will worship, and come again to you.
\[6]And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. And they went both of them together.
\[7]And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here I am, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
\[8]And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son. So they went both of them together.
\[9]And they came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.
\[10]And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
\[11]And the agent of Jehovah called to him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here I am.
\[12]And he said, Do not lay thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything to him. For now I know that thou fear God, since thou have not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.
\[13]And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son.
\[14]And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh. As it is said to this day, In the mount of Jehovah it shall be provided.
\[15]And the agent of Jehovah called to Abraham a second time out of heaven,
\[16]and said, By myself I have sworn, says Jehovah, because thou have done this thing, and have not withheld thy son, thine only son,
\[17]that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore, and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies,
\[18]and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou have obeyed my voice.
\[19]So Abraham returned to his young men. And they rose up and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.
\[20]And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also has borne sons to thy brother Nahor:
\[21]Uz his first born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
\[22]and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
\[23]And Bethuel begot Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.

\[3]And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,
\[4]I am a stranger and a sojourner with you. Give me a possession of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
\[5]And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,
\[6]Hear us, my lord. Thou are a prince of God among us. Bury thy dead in our choice sepulchers. None of us shall withhold from thee his sepulcher, but that thou may bury thy dead.
\[7]And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the sons of Heth.
\[8]And he conversed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
\[9]that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. Let him give it to me for the full price in the midst of you for a possession of a burying place.
\[10]Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the sons of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the sons of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,
\[11]No, my lord, hear me. I give thee the field. And the cave that is in it, I give it to thee. I give it to thee in the presence of the sons of my people. Bury thy dead.
\[12]And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.
\[13]And he spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou will, I pray thee, hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there.
\[14]And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
\[15]My lord, hearken to me. A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and thee? Therefore bury thy dead.
\[16]And Abraham hearkened to Ephron. And Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver that he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
\[17]So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border of it round about, were made sure
\[18]to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
\[19]And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan.

nd Abraham was old, well stricken in age. And Jehovah had blessed Abraham in all things.
\[2]And Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, Put thy hand, I pray thee, under my thigh.
\[3]And I will make thee swear by Jehovah, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou will not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.
\[4]But thou shall go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.
\[5]And the servant said to him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I bring thy son again to the land from where thou came?
\[6]And Abraham said to him, Beware thou that thou not bring my son there again.
\[7]Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my nativity, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To thy seed I will give this land, he will send his agent before thee, and thou shall take a wife for my son from there.
\[8]And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shall be clear from this my oath. Only thou shall not bring my son there again.
\[9]And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.
\[10]And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed, having all goodly things of his master's in his hand. And he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.
\[11]And he made the camels to kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.
\[12]And he said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray thee, good speed this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.
\[13]Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water. And the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
\[14]And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink. And she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. Let the same be she that thou have appointed for thy servant Isaac. And thereby I shall know that thou have shown kindness to my master.
\[15]And it came to pass, before he was done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
\[16]And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her. And she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
\[17]And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher.
\[18]And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hurried, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
\[19]And when she had finished giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.
\[20]And she hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.
\[21]And the man looked steadfastly on her, keeping silent, to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not.
\[22]And it came to pass, as the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,
\[23]and said, Whose daughter are thou? Tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?
\[24]And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.
\[25]She said moreover to him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
\[26]And the man bowed his head, and worshiped Jehovah.
\[27]And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, Jehovah has led me in the way to the house of my master's brothers.
\[28]And the damsel ran, and told her mother's house according to these words.
\[29]And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. And Laban ran out to the man, to the fountain.
\[30]And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me, that he came to the man. And, behold, he was standing by the camels at the fountain.
\[31]And he said, Come in, thou blessed of Jehovah. Why do thou stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
\[32]And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels. And he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
\[33]And there was set before him food to eat. But he said, I will not eat until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on.
\[34]And he said, I am Abraham's servant.
\[35]And Jehovah has blessed my master greatly, and he has become great. And he has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and men-servants and maid-servants, and camels and donkeys.
\[36]And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old. And has he given to him all that he has.
\[37]And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell,
\[38]but thou shall go to my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.
\[39]And I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow me.
\[40]And he said to me, Jehovah, before whom I walk, will send his agent with thee, and prosper thy way. And thou shall take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house.
\[41]Then thou shall be clear from my oath, when thou come to my kindred. And if they do not give her to thee, thou shall be clear from my oath.
\[42]And I came this day to the fountain, and said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, if thou do now prosper my way which I go,
\[43]behold, I am standing by the fountain of water, and let it come to pass, that the maiden who comes forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher to drink,
\[44]and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels, let the same be the woman whom Jehovah has appointed for my master's son.
\[45]And before I was done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder. And she went down to the fountain, and drew. And I said to her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
\[46]And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. So I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
\[47]And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter are thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him. And I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands.
\[48]And I bowed my head, and worshiped Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son.
\[49]And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
\[50]Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from Jehovah; we cannot speak to thee bad or good.
\[51]Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as Jehovah has spoken.
\[52]And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to Jehovah.
\[53]And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.
\[54]And they ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and tarried all night. And they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.
\[55]And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten. After that she shall go.
\[56]And he said to them, Do not hinder me, since Jehovah has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.
\[57]And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.
\[58]And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Will thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
\[59]And they sent Rebekah their sister away, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.
\[60]And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those who hate them.
\[61]And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
\[62]And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi, for he dwelt in the land of the South.
\[63]And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.
\[64]And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel.
\[65]And she said to the servant, What man is this who walks in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master. And she took her veil, and covered herself.
\[66]And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
\[67]And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

\[2]And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
\[3]And Jokshan begot Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
\[4]And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah.
\[5]And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.
\[6]But to the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.
\[7]And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred seventy-five years.
\[8]And Abraham gave up the spirit, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.
\[9]And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre,
\[10]the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife.
\[11]And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.
\[12]Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham.
\[13]And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
\[14]and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
\[15]Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
\[16]These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their nations.
\[17]And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty-seven years. And he gave up the spirit and died, and was gathered to his people.
\[18]And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur which is before Egypt, as thou go toward Assyria. He abode opposite all his brothers.
\[19]And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begot Isaac.
\[20]And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.
\[21]And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren. And Jehovah was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
\[22]And the children struggled together within her. And she said, If it be so, why do I live? And she went to inquire of Jehovah.
\[23]And Jehovah said to her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels. And the one people shall be stronger than the other people. And the elder shall serve the younger.
\[24]And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
\[25]And the first came forth red all over like a hairy garment, and they called his name Esau.
\[26]And after that his brother came forth, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel, and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.
\[27]And the boys grew. And Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field. And Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.
\[28]Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his venison. And Rebekah loved Jacob.
\[29]And Jacob boiled pottage. And Esau came in from the field, and he was faint.
\[30]And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage, for I am faint. Therefore his name was called Edom.
\[31]And Jacob said, First sell me thy birthright.
\[32]And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die, and what profit shall the birthright do to me?
\[33]And Jacob said, Swear to me first. And he swore to him, and he sold his birthright to Jacob.
\[34]And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils. And he ate and drank, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.

nd there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.
\[2]And Jehovah appeared to him, and said, Do not go down into Egypt. Dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.
\[3]Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee. For to thee, and to thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham thy father.
\[4]And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give to thy seed all these lands, and in thy seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed,
\[5]because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my order, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
\[6]And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.
\[7]And the men of the place asked him of his wife. And he said, She is my sister. For he feared to say, My wife, Lest, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah, because she was fair to look upon.
\[8]And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was playing with Rebekah his wife.
\[9]And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, she is certainly thy wife, and how did thou say, She is my sister? And Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I die because of her.
\[10]And Abimelech said, What is this thou have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou would have brought guiltiness upon us.
\[11]And Abimelech ordered all the people, saying, He who touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
\[12]And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold. And Jehovah blessed him.
\[13]And the man became great, and grew more and more until he became very great.
\[14]And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household. And the Philistines envied him.
\[15]Now all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with soil.
\[16]And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us, for thou are much mightier than we.
\[17]And Isaac departed from there, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
\[18]And Isaac again dug the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. And he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
\[19]And Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
\[20]And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. And he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.
\[21]And they dug another well, and they strove for that also. And he called the name of it Sitnah.
\[22]And he moved from there, and dug another well, and they did not strive for that. And he called the name of it Rehoboth. And he said, For now Jehovah has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
\[23]And he went up from there to Beersheba.
\[24]And Jehovah appeared to him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.
\[25]And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah, and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac's servants dug a well.
\[26]Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army.
\[27]And Isaac said to them, Why have ye come to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
\[28]And they said, We saw plainly that Jehovah was with thee. And we said, Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and thee. And let us make a covenant with thee,
\[29]that thou will do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done to thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace. Thou are now the blessed of Jehovah.
\[30]And he made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.
\[31]And they rose up promptly in the morning, and swore one to another. And Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
\[32]And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, We have found water.
\[33]And he called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.
\[34]And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.
\[35]And they were a bitterness of spirit to Isaac and to Rebekah.

\[2]And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.
\[3]Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take venison for me.
\[4]And make savory food for me, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, that my soul may bless thee before I die.
\[5]And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
\[6]And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak to Esau thy brother, saying,
\[7]Bring venison for me, and make savory food for me, that I may eat, and bless thee before Jehovah before my death.
\[8]Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.
\[9]Go now to the flock, and fetch me two good kids of the goats from there. And I will make them savory food for thy father, such as he loves.
\[10]And thou shall bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death.
\[11]And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
\[12]My father will perhaps feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver. And I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
\[13]And his mother said to him, Upon me be thy curse, my son. Only obey my voice, and go fetch them for me.
\[14]And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother. And his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.
\[15]And Rebekah took the goodly garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son.
\[16]And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck.
\[17]And she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
\[18]And he came to his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here I am. Who are thou, my son?
\[19]And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau thy firstborn. I have done according as thou bade me. Arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
\[20]And Isaac said to his son, How is it that thou have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah thy God sent me good speed.
\[21]And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.
\[22]And Jacob went near to Isaac his father. And he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
\[23]And he did not discern him, because his hands were hairy as his brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him.
\[24]And he said, Are thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
\[25]And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he ate. And he brought wine to him, and he drank.
\[26]And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
\[27]And he came near, and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field that Jehovah has blessed.
\[28]And God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and new wine.
\[29]Let peoples serve thee, and nations bow down to thee. Be lord over thy brothers, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee. Cursed be he who curses thee, and blessed be he who blesses thee.
\[30]And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
\[31]And he also made savory food, and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.
\[32]And Isaac his father said to him, Who are thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn, Esau.
\[33]And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who then is he who has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou came, and have blessed him? Yea, he shall be blessed.
\[34]When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.
\[35]And he said, Thy brother came with guile, and has taken away thy blessing.
\[36]And he said, Is not he rightly name Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright, and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have thou not reserved a blessing for me?
\[37]And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. And what then shall I do for thee, my son?
\[38]And Esau said to his father, Have thou but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
\[39]And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold, of the fatness of the earth shall be thy dwelling, and of the dew of heaven from above.
\[40]And by thy sword thou shall live, and thou shall serve thy brother. And it shall come to pass, when thou shall break loose, that thou shall shake his yoke from off thy neck.
\[41]And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob.
\[42]And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah. And she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, thy brother Esau comforts himself concerning thee, to kill thee.
\[43]Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran.
\[44]And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turns away,
\[45]until thy brother's anger turns away from thee, and he forgets that which thou have done to him. Then I will send, and fetch thee from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?
\[46]And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?

\[3]And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou may be a company of peoples,
\[4]and give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee, that thou may inherit the land of thy sojourning, which God gave to Abraham.
\[5]And Isaac sent Jacob away. And he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
\[6]Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to take for him a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him an order, saying, Thou shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan,
\[7]and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram.
\[8]And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan did not please Isaac his father.
\[9]And Esau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.
\[10]And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.
\[11]And he touched upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set. And he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.
\[12]And he dreamed, and, behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And, behold, the agents of God ascending and descending on it.
\[13]And, behold, Jehovah stood above it, and said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. The land on which thou lie, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed.
\[14]And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shall spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
\[15]And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee wherever thou go, and will bring thee again into this land. For I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.
\[16]And Jacob awoke out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Jehovah is in this place, and I did not know it.
\[17]And he was afraid, and said, How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
\[18]And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
\[19]And he called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at first.
\[20]And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
\[21]so that I come again to my father's house in peace, and Jehovah will be my God,
\[22]then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house. And of all that thou shall give me I will surely give the tenth to thee.

\[3]And all the flocks were gathered there. And they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place.
\[4]And Jacob said to them, My brothers, where are ye from? And they said, We are of Haran.
\[5]And he said to them, Do ye know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.
\[6]And he said to them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well. And, behold, Rachel his daughter comes with the sheep.
\[7]And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together. Water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.
\[8]And they said, We cannot until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth. Then we water the sheep.
\[9]While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she kept them.
\[10]And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
\[11]And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
\[12]And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son. And she ran and told her father.
\[13]And it came to pass, when Laban heard the news of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
\[14]And Laban said to him, Surely thou are my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.
\[15]And Laban said to Jacob, Because thou are my brother, should thou therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall thy wages be?
\[16]And Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
\[17]And Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful and well favored.
\[18]And Jacob loved Rachel, and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
\[19]And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man. Abide with me.
\[20]And Jacob served seven years for Rachel. And they seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.
\[21]And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.
\[22]And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
\[23]And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. And he went in to her.
\[24]And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid to his daughter Leah for a handmaid.
\[25]And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this thou have done to me? Did I not serve with thee for Rachel? Why then have thou beguiled me?
\[26]And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.
\[27]Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shall serve with me yet seven other years.
\[28]And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. And he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife.
\[29]And Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter, Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid.
\[30]And he also went in to Rachel, and also he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.

\[34]And she conceived again, and bore a son, and said, Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore his name was called Levi.

\[3]And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in to her, that she may bear upon my knees, and I also may obtain sons by her.

\[16]And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in to me, for I have surely hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
\[17]And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son.
\[18]And Leah said, God has given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband. And she called his name Issachar.
\[19]And Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob.
\[20]And Leah said, God has endowed me with a good dowry. Now my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons. And she called his name Zebulun.
\[21]And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
\[22]And God remembered Rachel. And God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.
\[23]And she conceived, and bore a son, and said, God has taken away my reproach.
\[24]And she called his name Joseph, saying, Jehovah adds another son to me.
\[25]And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.
\[26]Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go, for thou know my service with which I have served thee.
\[27]And Laban said to him, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry, for I have learned by experience that Jehovah has blessed me for thy sake.
\[28]And he said, Appoint for me thy wages, and I will give it.
\[29]And he said to him, Thou know how I have served thee, and how thy cattle have fared with me.
\[30]For it was little which thou had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude, and Jehovah has blessed thee wherever I turned. And now when shall I provide for my own house also?
\[31]And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shall not give me anything. If thou will do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it.
\[32]I will pass through all thy flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats, and of such shall be my hire.
\[33]So shall my righteousness answer for me after this, when thou shall come concerning my hire that is before thee. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that is with me, shall be considered stolen.
\[34]And Laban said, Behold, O that it might be according to thy word.
\[35]And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.
\[36]And he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob. And Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
\[37]And Jacob took for him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane tree, and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white which was in the rods appear.
\[38]And he set the rods which he had peeled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink. And they conceived when they came to drink.
\[39]And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.
\[40]And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban. And he put his own herds apart, and did not put them near Laban's flock.
\[41]And it came to pass, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods,
\[42]but when the flock were weak, he did not put them in. So the weaker were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
\[43]And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and donkeys.

nd he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our father's, and he has gotten all this glory of that which was our father's.
\[2]And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime.
\[3]And Jehovah said to Jacob, Return to the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred, and I will be with thee.
\[4]And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,
\[5]and said to them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime, but the God of my father has been with me.
\[6]And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
\[7]And your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God did not allow him to hurt me.
\[8]If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages, then all the flock bore speckled, and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be thy wages, then all the flock bore ringstreaked.
\[9]Thus God has taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
\[10]And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.
\[11]And the agent of God said to me in the dream, Jacob. And I said, Here I am.
\[12]And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to thee.
\[13]I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointed a pillar, where thou vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get thee out from this land, and return to the land of thy nativity.
\[14]And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
\[15]Are we not accounted by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also quite devoured our money.
\[16]For all the riches which God has taken away from our father, that is ours and our children's. Now then, whatever God has said to thee, do.
\[17]Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels.
\[18]And he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father to the land of Canaan.
\[19]Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's.
\[20]And Jacob slipped away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he did not tell him that he fled.
\[21]So he fled with all that he had. And he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.
\[22]And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.
\[23]And he took his brothers with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey, and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.
\[24]And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said to him, Take heed to thyself that thou not speak to Jacob either good or bad.
\[25]And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain. And Laban encamped with his brothers in the mountain of Gilead.
\[26]And Laban said to Jacob, What have thou done, that thou have slipped away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?
\[27]Why did thou flee secretly, and creep away from me, and did not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp,
\[28]and did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now thou have done foolishly.
\[29]It is in the power of my hand to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou not speak to Jacob either good or bad.
\[30]And now, though thou have certainly gone, because thou have been very desirous for thy father's house, yet why have thou stolen my gods?
\[31]And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, for I said, Lest thou should take thy daughters from me by force.
\[32]With whomever thou find thy gods, he shall not live. Before our brothers discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.
\[33]And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
\[34]Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel's saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban felt around all the tent, but did not find them.
\[35]And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee, for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but did not find the teraphim.
\[36]And Jacob was angry, and chided with Laban. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? What is my sin that thou have hotly pursued after me?
\[37]Whereas thou have felt around all my stuff, what have thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brothers and thy brothers, that they may judge between us two.
\[38]These twenty years I have been with thee, thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and I have not eaten the rams of thy flocks.
\[39]I did not bring to thee that which was torn by beasts; I bore the loss of it, of my hand thou required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
\[40]Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.
\[41]These twenty years I have been in thy house. I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock. And thou have changed my wages ten times.
\[42]Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now thou would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee last night.
\[43]And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou see is mine. And what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their sons whom they have borne?
\[44]And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou, and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
\[45]And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
\[46]And Jacob said to his brothers, Gather stones, and they took stones, and made a heap. And they ate there by the heap.
\[47]And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.
\[48]And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore the name of it was called Galeed,
\[49]and Mizpah. For he said, May Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another,
\[50]if thou will afflict my daughters, and if thou will take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us, see, God is witness between me and thee.
\[51]And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set between me and thee.
\[52]This heap is witness, and the pillar is witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shall not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
\[53]The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.
\[54]And Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his brothers to eat bread. And they ate bread, and tarried all night on the mountain.
\[55]And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. And Laban departed and returned to his place.

\[2]And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God's camp. And he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
\[3]And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.
\[4]And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say to my lord Esau, Thus says thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now.
\[5]And I have oxen, and donkeys, flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants. And I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.
\[6]And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he comes to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
\[7]Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. And he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies.
\[8]And he said, If Esau comes to the one company, and smites it, then the company which is left shall escape.
\[9]And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who said to me, Return to thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good,
\[10]I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou have shown to thy servant, for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I have become two companies.
\[11]Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau. For I fear him, lest he comes and smites me, the mother with the sons.
\[12]And thou said, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
\[13]And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:
\[14]two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
\[15]thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-donkeys and ten foals.
\[16]And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.
\[17]And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets thee, and asks thee, saying, Whose are thou? And where do thou go? And whose are these before thee?
\[18]Then thou shall say, Thy servant Jacob's. It is a present sent to my lord Esau. And, behold, he also is behind us.
\[19]And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all who followed the herds, saying, On this manner shall ye speak to Esau when ye find him,
\[20]and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.
\[21]So the present passed over before him, and he himself lodged that night in the company.
\[22]And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.
\[23]And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.
\[24]And Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.
\[25]And when he saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained as he wrestled with him.
\[26]And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let thee go unless thou bless me.
\[27]And he said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
\[28]And he said, Thy name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel, for thou have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.
\[29]And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Why is it that thou ask for my name? And he blessed him there.
\[30]And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, for, I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
\[31]And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh.
\[32]Therefore the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.

\[2]And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindmost.
\[3]And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
\[4]And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him, and they wept.
\[5]And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children, and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children whom God has graciously given thy servant.
\[6]Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
\[7]And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. And afterward Joseph came near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
\[8]And he said, What do thou mean by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.
\[9]And Esau said, I have enough, my brother, let that which thou have be thine.
\[10]And Jacob said, No, I pray thee, if now I have found favor in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand, inasmuch as I have seen thy face, as any man would see the face of God, and thou were pleased with me.
\[11]Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.
\[12]And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
\[13]And he said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.
\[14]Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir.
\[15]And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folks that are with me. And he said, What need is it? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.
\[16]So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
\[17]And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built for him a house, and made booths for his cattle. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
\[18]And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram, and encamped before the city.
\[19]And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred lambs.

\[2]And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. And he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her.
\[3]And his soul clung to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke kindly to the damsel.
\[4]And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
\[5]Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter. And his sons were with his cattle in the field, and Jacob held his peace until they came.
\[6]And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to converse with him.
\[7]And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. And the men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter, which thing ought not to be done.
\[8]And Hamor conversed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. I pray you, give her to him to wife.
\[9]And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to you.
\[10]And ye shall dwell with us, and the land shall be before you. Dwell and trade ye in it, and get possessions for you in it.
\[11]And Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say to me I will give.
\[12]Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say to me, but give me the damsel to wife.
\[13]And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,
\[14]and said to them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised, for that is a reproach to us.
\[15]Only on this condition will we consent to you: If ye will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised.
\[16]Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us. And we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
\[17]But if ye will not hearken to us, to be circumcised, then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
\[18]And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.
\[19]And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter. And he was honored above all the house of his father.
\[20]And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and conversed with the men of their city, saying,
\[21]These men are peaceable with us, therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade in it, for, behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
\[22]Only on this condition will the men consent to us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
\[23]Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.
\[24]And all who went out of the gate of his city hearkened to Hamor and to Shechem his son, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
\[25]And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and killed all the males.
\[26]And they killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went forth.
\[27]The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
\[28]They took their flocks and their herds and their donkeys, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,
\[29]and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, they took captive and made a prey, even all that was in the house.
\[30]And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. And, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me, and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.

\[3]And let us arise, and go up to Bethel, and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me on the way which I went.
\[4]And they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears. And Jacob hid them under the oak that was by Shechem.
\[5]And they journeyed, and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
\[6]So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Bethel), he and all the people that were with him.

\[12]And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to thee, and I will give the land to thy seed after thee.
\[13]And God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him.
\[14]And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. And he poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.
\[15]And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel.

\[19]And Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem).
\[20]And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave, the same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.

\[6]And he said to them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed.
\[7]For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright. And, behold, your sheaves came round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.
\[8]And his brothers said to him, Shall thou indeed reign over us? Or shall thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
\[9]And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers. And said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream again. And, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.
\[10]And he told it to his father, and to his brothers. And his father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream that thou have dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brothers indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
\[11]And his brothers envied him, but his father kept the saying in mind.
\[12]And his brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
\[13]And Israel said to Joseph, Are not thy brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee to them. And he said to him, Here I am.
\[14]And he said to him, Go now, see whether it is well with thy brothers, and well with the flock, and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
\[15]And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying, What do thou seek?
\[16]And he said, I am seeking my brothers. Tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding.
\[17]And the man said, They are departed from here, for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.
\[18]And they saw him afar off. And before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him.
\[19]And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer comes.
\[20]Come now therefore, and let us kill him, and cast him into one of the pits. And we will say, An evil beast has devoured him. And we shall see what will become of his dreams.
\[21]And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us not take his life.
\[22]And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood. Cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him, that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.
\[23]And it came to pass, when Joseph came to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him,
\[24]and they took him, and cast him into the pit. And the pit was empty; there was no water in it.
\[25]And they sat down to eat bread. And they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
\[26]And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?
\[27]Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brothers hearkened to him.
\[28]And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen, and they drew and lifted Joseph up out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.
\[29]And Reuben returned to the pit, and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit. And he tore his clothes,
\[30]and he returned to his brothers, and said, The child is not, and I, where shall I go?
\[31]And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood.
\[32]And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, We have found this. Know now whether it is thy son's coat or not.
\[33]And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat. An evil beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.
\[34]And Jacob tore his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
\[35]And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, and he said, For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning. And his father wept for him.
\[36]And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.

nd it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brothers, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
\[2]And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. And he took her, and went in to her.
\[3]And she conceived, and bore a son, and he called his name Er.
\[4]And she conceived again, and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.
\[5]And she yet again bore a son, and called his name Shelah. And he was at Chezib, when she bore him.
\[6]And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
\[7]And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah, and Jehovah killed him.
\[8]And Judah said to Onan, Go in to thy brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
\[9]And Onan knew that the seed would not be his. And it came to pass, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.
\[10]And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and he killed him also.
\[11]Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown up, for he said, Lest he also die, like his brothers. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
\[12]And in process of time Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died. And Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
\[13]And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goes up to Timnah to shear his sheep.
\[14]And she put the garments of her widowhood off from her, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah, for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given to him to wife.
\[15]When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot, for she had covered her face.
\[16]And he turned to her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me come in to thee, for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What will thou give me, that thou may come in to me?
\[17]And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Will thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?
\[18]And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet and thy cord, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.
\[19]And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
\[20]And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand, but he did not find her.
\[21]Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute, who was at Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There has been no prostitute here.
\[22]And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her, and also the men of the place said, There has been no prostitute here.
\[23]And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be put to shame. Behold, I sent this kid, and thou have not found her.
\[24]And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law has played the harlot, and moreover, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
\[25]When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man, whose these are, I am with child. And she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose these are, the signet, and the cords, and the staff.
\[26]And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She is more righteous than I, inasmuch as I did not give her to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.
\[27]And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.
\[28]And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand. And the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
\[29]And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out. And she said, Why have thou made a breach for thyself? Therefore his name was called Perez.
\[30]And afterward his brother came out, who had the scarlet thread upon his hand. And his name was called Zerah.

nd Joseph was brought down to Egypt. And Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down there.
\[2]And Jehovah was with Joseph. And he was a man who succeeds. And he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
\[3]And his master saw that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
\[4]And Joseph found favor in his sight, and he ministered to him. And he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
\[5]And it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake. And the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.
\[6]And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand, and he knew nothing that was with him, save the bread which he ate. And Joseph was comely, and well-favored.
\[7]And it came to pass, after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and she said, Lie with me.
\[8]But he refused, and said to his master's wife, Behold, my master does not know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand.
\[9]He is not greater in this house than I, nor has he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
\[10]And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he did not hearken to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.
\[11]And it came to pass, about this time, that he went into the house to do his work, and there was none of the men of the house there inside.
\[12]And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me. And he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got out.
\[13]And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,
\[14]that she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.
\[15]And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got out.
\[16]And she laid up his garment by her until his master came home.
\[17]And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom thou have brought to us, came in to me to mock me.
\[18]And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled out.
\[19]And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me, that his wrath was kindled.
\[20]And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were bound. And he was there in the prison.
\[21]But Jehovah was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
\[22]And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. And whatever they did there, he was the doer of it.
\[23]The keeper of the prison did not look to anything that was under his hand, because Jehovah was with him, and that which he did, Jehovah made it prosper.

nd it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt, and his baker, offended their lord the king of Egypt.
\[2]And Pharaoh was angry against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
\[3]And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
\[4]And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he ministered to them. And they continued a season in ward.
\[5]And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.
\[6]And Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were sad.
\[7]And he asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in ward in his master's house, saying, Why do ye look so sad today?
\[8]And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no man who can interpret it. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell it to me, I pray you.
\[9]And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me.
\[10]And in the vine were three branches. And it was as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters of it brought forth ripe grapes.
\[11]And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
\[12]And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days.
\[13]Within yet three days Pharaoh shall lift up thy head, and restore thee to thine office. And thou shall give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou was his butler.
\[14]But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.
\[15]For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
\[16]When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head.
\[17]And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head.
\[18]And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation of it: The three baskets are three days.
\[19]Within yet three days Pharaoh shall lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree, and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
\[20]And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast to all his servants. And he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
\[21]And he restored the chief butler to his butlership again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand,
\[22]but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.
\[23]Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.

nd it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed. And, behold, he stood by the river.
\[2]And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, well-favored and fat-fleshed, and they fed in the reed grass.
\[3]And, behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and stood by the other cows upon the brink of the river.
\[4]And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed cows ate up the seven well-favored and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.
\[5]And he slept and dreamed a second time. And, behold, seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk, fat and good.
\[6]And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
\[7]And the thin ears swallowed up the seven fat and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
\[8]And it came to pass in the morning, that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men of it. And Pharaoh told them his dream, but there was no man who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
\[9]Then the chief butler spoke to Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day.
\[10]Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker.
\[11]And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he, we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
\[12]And there was a young man with us there, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him. And he interpreted to us our dreams. He interpreted to each man according to his dream.
\[13]And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; he restored me to my office, and he hanged him.
\[14]Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph. And they brought him hastily out of the dungeon, and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in to Pharaoh.
\[15]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is no man who can interpret it. And I have heard say of thee, that when thou hear a dream thou can interpret it.
\[16]And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
\[17]And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river.
\[18]And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fat-fleshed and well-favored, and they fed in the reed grass.
\[19]And, behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness.
\[20]And the lean and ill-favored cows ate up the first seven fat cows.
\[21]And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
\[22]And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good.
\[23]And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them,
\[24]and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no man who could declare it to me.
\[25]And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one; what God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh.
\[26]The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream is one.
\[27]And the seven lean and ill-favored cows that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind, they shall be seven years of famine.
\[28]That is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh. What God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh.
\[29]Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt,
\[30]and there shall arise after them seven years of famine. And all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine shall consume the land.
\[31]And the plenty shall not be known in the land because of that famine which follows, for it shall be very grievous.
\[32]And because the dream was doubled to Pharaoh, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
\[33]Now therefore let Pharaoh look out for a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
\[34]Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plentiful years.
\[35]And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.
\[36]And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt, that the land not perish through the famine.
\[37]And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
\[38]And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the spirit of God?
\[39]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Inasmuch as God has shown thee all of this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou.
\[40]Thou shall be over my house, and according to thy word all my people shall be ruled. Only in the throne I will be greater than thou.
\[41]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
\[42]And Pharaoh took his signet ring from off his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck.
\[43]And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had, and they cried before him, Bow the knee. And he set him over all the land of Egypt.
\[44]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee no man shall lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.
\[45]And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah, and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, for a wife. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
\[46]And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[47]And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
\[48]And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities. The food of the field, which was round about every city, he laid up in the same.
\[49]And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering, for it was without number.
\[50]And two sons were born to Joseph before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.
\[51]And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, for God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
\[52]And the name of the second he called Ephraim, for God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.
\[53]And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end.
\[54]And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said. And there was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
\[55]And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he says to you, do.
\[56]And the famine was over all the face of the earth. And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians. And the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
\[57]And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe on all the earth.

\[2]And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Get you down there, and buy for us from there, that we may live, and not die.
\[3]And Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
\[4]But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob did not send with his brothers, for he said, Lest perhaps harm befall him.
\[5]And the sons of Israel came to buy among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
\[6]And Joseph was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth.
\[7]And Joseph saw his brothers, and he knew them, but made himself foreign to them, and spoke roughly with them. And he said to them. From where come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
\[8]And Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not know him.
\[9]And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them. And said to them, Ye are spies; ye have come to see the nakedness of the land.
\[10]And they said to him, No, my lord, but thy servants have come to buy food.
\[11]We are all one man's sons. We are true men. Thy servants are no spies.
\[12]And he said to them, No, but ye have come to see the nakedness of the land.
\[13]And they said, We thy servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. And, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
\[14]And Joseph said to them, This is that which I spoke to you, saying, Ye are spies.
\[15]By this ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth from here unless your youngest brother comes here.
\[16]Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother. And ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.
\[17]And he put them all together into ward three days.
\[18]And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live, for I fear God:
\[19]If ye be true men, let one of your brothers be bound in your prison house, but go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses,
\[20]and bring your youngest brother to me. So shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
\[21]And they said one to another, We are truly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul when he besought us, and we would not hear. Therefore this distress has come upon us.
\[22]And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Sin not against the child, and ye would not hear? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required.
\[23]And they did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them.
\[24]And he turned himself around from them, and wept. And he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.
\[25]Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provisions for the way. And thus it was done to them.
\[26]And they loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there.
\[27]And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey provender in the lodging place, he saw his money, and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
\[28]And he said to his brothers, My money is restored, and, lo, it is even in my sack. And their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God has done to us?
\[29]And they came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,
\[30]The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.
\[31]And we said to him, We are true men, and we are no spies.
\[32]We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
\[33]And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, By this I shall know that ye are true men. Leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way,
\[34]and bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and ye shall trade in the land.
\[35]And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack. And when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.
\[36]And Jacob their father said to them, Ye have bereaved me of my sons. Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.
\[37]And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Kill my two sons if I do not bring him to thee. Deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
\[38]And he said, My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm befalls him by the way in which ye go, then ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.

\[10]For unless we had lingered, surely we would have now returned a second time.
\[11]And their father Israel said to them, If it be so now, do this: Take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry a present down to the man, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts, and almonds.
\[12]And take double money in your hand, and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry again in your hand. Perhaps it was an oversight.
\[13]Also take your brother, and arise, go again to the man.
\[14]And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. And if I be bereaved of my sons, I am bereaved.
\[15]And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin, and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
\[16]And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and kill, and make ready, for the men shall dine with me at noon.
\[17]And the man did as Joseph bade, and the man brought the men to Joseph's house.
\[18]And the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house, and they said, We are brought in because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our donkeys.
\[19]And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,
\[20]and said, Oh, my lord, we indeed came down at the first time to buy food.
\[21]And it came to pass, when we came to the lodging place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. And we have brought it again in our hand.
\[22]And we have brought other money down in our hand to buy food. We know not who put our money in our sacks.
\[23]And he said, Peace be to you, fear not. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I had your money. And he brought Simeon out to them.
\[24]And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. And he gave their donkeys provender.
\[25]And they made ready the present against Joseph's coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.
\[26]And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth.
\[27]And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?
\[28]And they said, Thy servant our father is well; he is yet alive. And they bowed the head, and made obeisance.
\[29]And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to thee, my son.
\[30]And Joseph made haste, for his heart yearned over his brother, and he sought where to weep. And he entered into his chamber, and wept there.
\[31]And he washed his face, and came out. And he restrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
\[32]And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, who ate with him, by themselves, because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.
\[33]And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth. And the men marveled one with another.
\[34]And he took and sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin's portion was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.

nd he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.
\[2]And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
\[3]As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.
\[4]And when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Up, follow after the men, and when thou overtake them, say to them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?
\[5]Is not this that in which my lord drinks, and how he indeed divines? Ye have done evil in so doing.
\[6]And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these words.
\[7]And they said to him, Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing.
\[8]Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to thee out of the land of Canaan. How then would we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?
\[9]With whomever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.
\[10]And he said, Now also let it be according to your words. He with whom it is found shall be my bondman, and ye shall be blameless.
\[11]Then they hurried, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
\[12]And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
\[13]Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city.
\[14]And Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house. And he was yet there, and they fell before him on the ground.
\[15]And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that ye have done? Know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine?
\[16]And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak, or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of thy servants. Behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.
\[17]And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman, but as for you, get you up in peace to your father.
\[18]Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant, for thou are even as Pharaoh.
\[19]My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
\[20]And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one. And his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.
\[21]And thou said to thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him.
\[22]And we said to my lord, The young man cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.
\[23]And thou said to thy servants, Unless your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
\[24]And it came to pass when we came up to thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
\[25]And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.
\[26]And we said, We cannot go down. If our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down, for we may not see the man's face unless our youngest brother be with us.
\[27]And thy servant my father said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two sons.
\[28]And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces, and I have not seen him since.
\[29]And if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.
\[30]Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the young man is not with us, since his life is bound up in the young man's life,
\[31]it will come to pass, when he sees that the young man is not with us, that he will die. And thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.
\[32]For thy servant became surety for the young man to my father, saying, If I do not bring him to thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father forever.
\[33]Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide a bondman to my lord instead of the young man, and let the young man go up with his brothers.
\[34]For how shall I go up to my father, if the young man be not with me? Lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.

\[2]And he wept aloud, and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.
\[3]And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph, does my father yet live? And his brothers could not answer him, for they were troubled at his presence.
\[4]And Joseph said to his brothers, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near, and he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
\[5]And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.
\[6]For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there are yet five years, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest.
\[7]And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.
\[8]So now it was not you that sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
\[9]Hasten ye, and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus says thy son Joseph: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me, delay not.
\[10]And thou shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shall be near to me, thou, and thy sons, and thy sons' sons, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou have.
\[11]And there will I nourish thee, for there are yet five years of famine, lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all that thou have.
\[12]And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.
\[13]And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen. And ye shall hasten and bring down my father here.
\[14]And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
\[15]And he kissed all his brothers, and wept upon them. And after that his brothers talked with him.
\[16]And the report of it was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brothers have come. And it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
\[17]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to thy brothers, This do ye: Load your beasts, and go, get you to the land of Canaan,
\[18]and take your father and your households, and come to me. And I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
\[19]Now thou are commanded, this do ye: Take wagons for you out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
\[20]Also do not regard your stuff, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.
\[21]And the sons of Israel did so. And Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
\[22]He gave to all of them, each man, changes of raiment, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.
\[23]And he sent to his father according to this manner: ten donkeys laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-donkeys laden with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.
\[24]So he sent his brothers away, and they departed. And he said to them, See that ye not fall out by the way.
\[25]And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.
\[26]And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he did not believe them.
\[27]And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them. And when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived.
\[28]And Israel said, It is enough, Joseph my son is yet alive. I will go and see him before I die.

\[4]I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will also surely bring thee up again, and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
\[5]And Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
\[6]And they took up their goods, and all their property, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, they came into the land of Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:
\[7]the sons, and the sons of his sons with him, his daughters, and the daughters of his daughters. And he brought all his seed into Egypt.
\[8]And these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.
\[9]And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.

\[11]And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
\[12]And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah. But Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
\[13]And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron.
\[14]And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
\[15]These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three.
\[16]And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
\[17]And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister. And the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel.

\[19]The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.
\[20]And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bore to him.
\[21]And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.
\[22]These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.

\[30]And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou are yet alive.
\[31]And Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father's house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, My brothers, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.
\[32]And the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle, and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.

\[34]that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers, that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.

\[2]And he took five men from among his brothers, and presented them to Pharaoh.
\[3]And Pharaoh said to his brothers, What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.
\[4]And they said to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for thy servants' flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
\[5]And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brothers have come to thee.
\[6]The land of Egypt is before thee. Make thy father and thy brothers to dwell in the best of the land; in the land of Goshen let them dwell. And if thou know any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
\[7]And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
\[8]And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life?
\[9]And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
\[10]And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
\[11]And Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
\[12]And Joseph nourished his father, and his brothers, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.
\[13]And there was no bread in all the land, for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
\[14]And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought. And Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
\[15]And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread, for why should we die in thy presence? For our money fails.
\[16]And Joseph said, Give your cattle, and I will give you for your cattle, if money fails.
\[17]And they brought their cattle to Joseph. And Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys. And he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year.
\[18]And when that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent, and the herds of cattle are my lord's; there is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands.
\[19]Why should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land not be desolate.
\[20]So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh. For the Egyptians, every man, sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. And the land became Pharaoh's.
\[21]And as for the people, he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it.
\[22]Only he did not buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. Therefore they did not sell their land.
\[23]Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh. Lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
\[24]And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for those of your households, and for food for your little ones.
\[25]And they said, Thou have saved our lives. Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.
\[26]And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh's.
\[27]And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they got possessions in it, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.
\[28]And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty-seven years.
\[29]And the time drew near that Israel must die. And he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, put thy hand, I pray thee, under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt,
\[30]but when I sleep with my fathers, thou shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place. And he said, I will do as thou have said.

\[2]And it was reported to Jacob, saying, Behold, thy son Joseph comes to thee. And Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
\[3]And Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
\[4]and said to me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples, and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.
\[5]And now thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came to thee into Egypt, are mine, Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine.
\[6]And thy issue, which thou beget after them, shall be thine, they shall be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.
\[7]And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath. And I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem).
\[8]And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?
\[9]And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, to me, and I will bless them.
\[10]Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near to him, and he kissed them, and embraced them.
\[11]And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face, and, lo, God has let me see thy seed also.
\[12]And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
\[13]And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him.
\[14]And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands deliberately, for Manasseh was the firstborn.
\[15]And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,
\[16]the agent who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads, and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
\[17]And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. And he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
\[18]And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn, put thy right hand upon his head.
\[19]And his father refused, and said, I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great. However, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
\[20]And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh. And he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
\[21]And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die, but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.
\[22]Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.

nd Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
\[2]And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. And the physicians embalmed Israel.
\[3]And forty days were fulfilled for him, for so are fulfilled the days of embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.
\[4]And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
\[5]My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die. In my grave which I have dug for me in the land of Canaan, there shall thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
\[6]And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
\[7]And Joseph went up to bury his father, and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
\[8]and all the house of Joseph, and his brothers, and his father's house. Only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
\[9]And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen. And it was a very great company.
\[10]And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan. And there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation. And he made a mourning for his father seven days.
\[11]And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians. Therefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
\[12]And his sons did to him according as he commanded them.
\[13]For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burying place, of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
\[14]And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brothers, and all who went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
\[15]And when Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did to him.
\[16]And they sent a message to Joseph, saying, Thy father commanded before he died, saying,
\[17]So shall ye say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brothers, and their sin, because they did to thee evil. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
\[18]And his brothers also went and fell down before his face, and they said, Behold, we are thy servants.
\[19]And Joseph said to them, Fear not, for am I in the place of God?
\[20]And as for you, ye meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
\[21]Now therefore fear ye not. I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.
\[22]And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house. And Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.
\[23]And Joseph saw Ephraim's sons of the third generation. Also the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph's knees.
\[24]And Joseph said to his brothers, I die, but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
\[25]And Joseph took an oath of the sons of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from here.
\[26]So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

\[2]Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
\[3]Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
\[4]Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
\[5]And all the souls who came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls. And Joseph was in Egypt already.
\[6]And Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.
\[7]And the sons of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty, and the land was filled with them.
\[8]Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
\[9]And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are more and mightier than we.
\[10]Come, let us deal craftily with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when war happens, they also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land.
\[11]Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. And they built store-cities for Pharaoh, Pithom and Rameses.
\[12]But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. And they were grieved because of the sons of Israel.
\[13]And the Egyptians made the sons of Israel to serve with rigor.
\[14]And they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, with which they made them serve with rigor.
\[15]And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah.
\[16]And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the birth-stool, if it be a son, then ye shall kill him, but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.
\[17]But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male children alive.
\[18]And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the male children alive?
\[19]And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women, for they are lively, and are delivered before the midwife comes to them.
\[20]And God dealt well with the midwives. And the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.
\[21]And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them households.
\[22]And Pharaoh ordered all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

nd there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.
\[2]And the woman conceived, and bore a son. And when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.
\[3]And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch. And she put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river's edge.
\[4]And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.
\[5]And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, and her maidens walked along by the riverside. And she saw the ark among the reeds, and sent her handmaid to fetch it.
\[6]And she opened it, and saw the child, and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.
\[7]Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call a nurse for thee from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
\[8]And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child's mother.
\[9]And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.
\[10]And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.
\[11]And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out to his brothers, and looked on their burdens. And he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brothers.
\[12]And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
\[13]And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together. And he said to him who did the wrong, Why do thou smite thy neighbor?
\[14]And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Do thou think to kill me, as thou killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.
\[15]Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.
\[16]Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. And they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
\[17]And the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
\[18]And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye have come so soon today?
\[19]And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.
\[20]And he said to his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.
\[21]And Moses was content to dwell with the man, and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
\[22]And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom, for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.
\[23]And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died. And the sons of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.
\[24]And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

\[2]And the agent of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. And he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
\[3]And Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
\[4]And when Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here I am.
\[5]And he said, Do not draw near here. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place on which thou stand is holy ground.
\[6]Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.
\[7]And Jehovah said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.
\[8]And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
\[9]And now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.
\[10]Come now therefore, and I will send thee to Pharaoh, that thou may bring forth my people the sons of Israel out of Egypt.
\[11]And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the sons of Israel out of Egypt?
\[12]And he said, I will certainly be with thee. And this shall be the sign to thee, that I have sent thee: When thou have brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
\[13]And Moses said to God, Behold, when I come to the sons of Israel, and shall say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say to them?
\[14]And God said to Moses, I AM WHO I AM. And he said, Thus shall thou say to the sons of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.
\[15]And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shall thou say to the sons of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations.
\[16]Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt.
\[17]And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.
\[18]And they shall hearken to thy voice. And thou shall come, thou and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and ye shall say to him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. And now let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.
\[19]And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go, no, not by a mighty hand.
\[20]And I will put forth my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst of it, and after that he will let you go.
\[21]And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. And it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.
\[22]But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who sojourns in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment. And ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters, and ye shall despoil the Egyptians.

\[2]And Jehovah said to him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A rod.
\[3]And he said, Cast in on the ground. And he cast it on the ground. And it became a serpent, and Moses fled from before it.
\[4]And Jehovah said to Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail (and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand),
\[5]that they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to thee.
\[6]And Jehovah said furthermore to him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom. And when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as snow.
\[7]And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. (And he put his hand into his bosom again, and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.)
\[8]And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, nor hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.
\[9]And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe even these two signs, nor hearken to thy voice, that thou shall take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land. And the water which thou take out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.
\[10]And Moses said to Jehovah, Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou have spoken to thy servant, for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.
\[11]And Jehovah said to him, Who has made man's mouth? Or who makes a man dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, Jehovah?
\[12]Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shall speak.
\[13]And he said, Oh, Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou will send.
\[14]And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there not Aaron thy brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he comes forth to meet thee, and when he sees thee, he will be glad in his heart.
\[15]And thou shall speak to him, and put the words in his mouth. And I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do,
\[16]and he shall be thy spokesman to the people. And it shall come to pass, that he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shall be to him as God.
\[17]And thou shall take this rod in thy hand, with which thou shall do the signs.
\[18]And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.
\[19]And Jehovah said to Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt, for all the men are dead who sought thy life.
\[20]And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
\[21]And Jehovah said to Moses, When thou go back into Egypt, see that thou do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in thy hand, but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.
\[22]And thou shall say to Pharaoh, Thus says Jehovah, Israel is my son, my firstborn,
\[23]and I have said to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me, and thou have refused to let him go. Behold, I will slay thy son, thy firstborn.
\[24]And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place, that Jehovah met him, and sought to kill him.
\[25]Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet. And she said, Surely a bridegroom of blood thou are to me.
\[26]So he let him alone. Then she said, A bridegroom of blood thou are, because of the circumcision.
\[27]And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him on the mountain of God, and kissed him.
\[28]And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had ordered him.
\[29]And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the sons of Israel.
\[30]And Aaron spoke all the words which Jehovah had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.

\[3]And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.
\[4]And the king of Egypt said to them, Therefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, loose the people from their works? Get you to your burdens.
\[5]And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.
\[6]And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,
\[7]Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick as formerly. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.
\[8]And the number of the bricks, which they made formerly, ye shall lay upon them. Ye shall not diminish any of it. For they are idle, therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.
\[9]Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labor in it, and let them not regard lying words.
\[10]And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.
\[11]Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it, for none of your work shall be diminished.
\[12]So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
\[13]And the taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfill your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.
\[14]And the officers of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Why have ye not fulfilled your task both yesterday and today, in making brick as formerly?
\[15]Then the officers of the sons of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why do thou deal thus with thy servants?
\[16]There is no straw given to thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick. And, behold, thy servants are beaten, but the fault it in thine own people.
\[17]But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle. Therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah.
\[18]Go therefore now, and work, for there shall no straw be given you, yet ye shall deliver the number of bricks.
\[19]And the officers of the sons of Israel saw that they were in affliction, when it was said, Ye shall not diminish anything from your bricks, your daily tasks.
\[20]And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh,
\[21]and they said to them, Jehovah look upon you, and judge, because ye have made our fragrance to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.
\[22]And Moses returned to Jehovah, and said, Lord, why have thou dealt ill with this people? Why is it that thou have sent me?

\[9]When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Show a wonder for you, then thou shall say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.
\[10]And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh. And they did so, as Jehovah had commanded, and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
\[11]Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers. And they also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner with their enchantments.
\[12]For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents, but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
\[13]And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not hearken to them, as Jehovah had spoken.
\[14]And Jehovah said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart is stubborn; he refuses to let the people go.
\[15]Get thee to Pharaoh in the morning, lo, he goes out to the water, and thou shall stand by the river's edge to meet him, and the rod which was turned to a serpent thou shall take in thy hand.
\[16]And thou shall say to him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness. And, behold, until now thou have not hearkened.

\[18]And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul, and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river.
\[19]And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood, and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.
\[20]And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah commanded. And he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants, and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.
\[21]And the fish that were in the river died, and the river became foul, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river. And the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[22]And the magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments. And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not hearken to them, as Jehovah had spoken.
\[23]And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart.
\[24]And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink, for they could not drink of the water of the river.
\[25]And seven days were fulfilled, after Jehovah had smitten the river.

nd Jehovah spoke to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus says Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[2]And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs.
\[3]And the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs.
\[4]And the frogs shall come up both upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.
\[5]And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.
\[6]And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
\[7]And the magicians did in like manner with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
\[8]Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat Jehovah, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people, and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to Jehovah.
\[9]And Moses said to Pharaoh, Have this honor over me: When shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only?
\[10]And he said, Tomorrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word, that thou may know that there is none like Jehovah our God.
\[11]And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people, they shall remain in the river only.
\[12]And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh. And Moses cried to Jehovah concerning the frogs which he had brought upon Pharaoh.
\[13]And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses. And the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.
\[14]And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.
\[15]But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart, and did not hearken to them, as Jehovah had spoken.
\[16]And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[17]And they did so. And Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth. And there were lice upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[18]And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not. And there were lice upon man, and upon beast.
\[19]Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God. And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not hearken to them, as Jehovah had spoken.
\[20]And Jehovah said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh. Lo, he comes forth to the water. And say to him, Thus says Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[21]Else, if thou will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon they servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses. And the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they are.
\[22]And in that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there, to the end thou may know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth.
\[23]And I will put a division between my people and thy people. This sign shall be by tomorrow.
\[24]And Jehovah did so, and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses. And in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted because of the swarms of flies.
\[25]And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.
\[26]And Moses said, It is not right to do so, for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God. Lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?
\[27]We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God, as he shall command us.
\[28]And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness, only ye shall not go very far away. Entreat for me.
\[29]And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat Jehovah that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow. Only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah.
\[30]And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah.
\[31]And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses, and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.
\[32]And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.

hen Jehovah said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus says Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[2]For if thou refuse to let them go, and will still hold them,
\[3]behold, the hand of Jehovah is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the donkeys, upon the camels, upon the herds, and upon the flocks-a very grievous pestilence.
\[4]And Jehovah shall make a distinction between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt, and there shall nothing die of all that belongs to the sons of Israel.
\[5]And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, Tomorrow Jehovah shall do this thing in the land.
\[6]And Jehovah did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died, but of the cattle of the sons of Israel not one died.
\[7]And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.
\[8]And Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.
\[9]And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with sores upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[10]And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven, and it became a boil breaking forth with sores upon man and upon beast.
\[11]And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.
\[12]And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not hearken to them, as Jehovah had spoken to Moses.
\[13]And Jehovah said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus says Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[14]For this time I will send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, that thou may know that there is none like me in all the earth.
\[15]For now I have put forth my hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou have been cut off from the earth.
\[16]But indeed for this cause I have raised thee up, to display in thee my power, and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.
\[17]As yet thou exalt thyself against my people, that thou will not let them go?
\[18]Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.
\[19]Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle and all that thou have in the field, for every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.
\[20]He who feared the word of Jehovah among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses.
\[21]And he who did not regard the word of Jehovah left his servants and his cattle in the field.
\[22]And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.
\[23]And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven, and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth, and Jehovah rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
\[24]So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
\[25]And throughout all the land of Egypt the hail smote all that was in the field, both man and beast, and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.
\[26]Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel were, was there no hail.
\[27]And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time. Jehovah is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.
\[28]Entreat Jehovah, for there has been enough of these mighty thunderings and hail, and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.
\[29]And Moses said to him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to Jehovah. The thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail, that thou may know that the earth is Jehovah's.
\[30]But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear Jehovah God.
\[31]And the flax and the barley were smitten, for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.
\[32]But the wheat and the rye were not smitten, for they were not grown up.
\[33]And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to Jehovah, and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.
\[34]And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
\[35]And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the sons of Israel go, as Jehovah had spoken by Moses.

\[2]and that thou may tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought upon Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them, that ye may know that I am Jehovah.
\[3]And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, How long will thou refuse to humble thyself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[4]Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into thy border.
\[5]And they shall cover the face of the earth, so that no man is able to see the ground. And they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field.
\[6]And thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians, as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth to this day. And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh.
\[7]And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve Jehovah their God. Do thou not yet know that Egypt is destroyed?
\[8]And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh. And he said to them, Go, serve Jehovah your God, but who are those who shall go?
\[9]And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go, for we must hold a feast to Jehovah.
\[10]And he said to them, So be Jehovah with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones. Look, evil is before you.
\[11]Not so. Go ye now who are men, and serve Jehovah, for that is what ye desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
\[12]And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left.
\[13]And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night, and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
\[14]And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt, very grievous were they, before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.
\[15]For they covered the face of the whole ground, so that the land was darkened, and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. And there remained not any green thing, either tree nor herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
\[16]Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you.
\[17]Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat Jehovah your God, that he may only take away from me this death.
\[18]And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah.
\[19]And Jehovah turned an exceedingly strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea. There remained not one locust in all the border of Egypt.
\[20]But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go.
\[21]And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.
\[22]And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days,
\[23]they did not see each other, neither did anyone rise from his place for three days, but all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings.
\[24]And Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, Go ye, serve Jehovah, only let your flocks and your herds stay. Let your little ones also go with you.
\[25]And Moses said, Thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.
\[26]Our cattle shall also go with us, there shall not a hoof be left behind, for we must take of it to serve Jehovah our God, and we do not know with what we must serve Jehovah, until we come there.
\[27]But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.
\[28]And Pharaoh said to him, Get thee from me. Take heed to thyself, see my face no more, for in the day thou see my face thou shall die.

\[2]This month shall be to you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year to you.
\[3]Speak ye to all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household.
\[4]And if the household be too little for a lamb, then he and his neighbor next to his house shall take one according to the number of the souls, according to every man's eating ye shall make your count for the lamb.
\[5]Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old. Ye shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats.
\[6]And ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month, and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening.
\[7]And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side-posts and on the lintel upon the houses in which they shall eat it.
\[8]And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire, and unleavened bread, with bitter herbs they shall eat it.
\[9]Do not eat of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire, its head with its legs and with the inwards of it.
\[10]And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning, but that which remains of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.
\[11]And thus ye shall eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand. And ye shall eat it in haste. It is Jehovah's Passover.
\[12]For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast, and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments. I am Jehovah.
\[13]And the blood shall be to you for a sign upon the houses where ye are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.
\[14]And this day shall be to you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to Jehovah; throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever.
\[15]Seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread, even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
\[16]And in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation, no manner of work shall be done in them, except that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.
\[17]And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread, for in this selfsame day I have brought your armies out of the land of Egypt. Therefore ye shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever.
\[18]In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.
\[19]Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or one who is born in the land.
\[20]Ye shall eat nothing leavened, in all your habitations ye shall eat unleavened bread.
\[21]Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out, and take to you lambs according to your families, and kill the Passover.
\[22]And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin, and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.
\[23]For Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians, and when he sees the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.
\[24]And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons forever.
\[25]And it shall come to pass, when ye have come to the land which Jehovah will give you, according as he has promised, that ye shall keep this service.
\[26]And it shall come to pass, when your sons shall say to you, What do ye mean by this service?
\[27]that ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of Jehovah's Passover, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshiped.
\[28]And the sons of Israel went and did so, as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
\[29]And it came to pass at midnight, that Jehovah smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle.
\[30]And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead.
\[31]And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, get you forth from among my people, both ye and the sons of Israel, and go, serve Jehovah, as ye have said.
\[32]Take both your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone, and bless me also.
\[33]And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, We are all dead men.
\[34]And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.
\[35]And the sons of Israel did according to the word of Moses, and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment.
\[36]And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And they despoiled the Egyptians.
\[37]And the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, besides children.
\[38]And a mixed multitude also went up with them, and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.
\[39]And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any provisions.
\[40]Now the time that the sons of Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan was four hundred and thirty years.
\[41]And it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the armies of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt.
\[42]It is a night to be much observed to Jehovah for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of Jehovah, to be much observed of all the sons of Israel throughout their generations.
\[43]And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the Passover. There shall no foreigner eat of it,
\[44]but every man's servant who is bought for money, when thou have circumcised him, then he shall eat of it.
\[45]A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.
\[46]In one house it shall be eaten. Thou shall not carry forth any of the flesh abroad out of the house, neither shall ye break a bone of it.
\[47]All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
\[48]And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the Passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it, and he shall be as one who is born in the land, but no uncircumcised man shall eat of it.
\[49]One law shall be to him who is home-born, and to the stranger who sojourns among you.

\[4]This day ye go forth in the month Abib.
\[5]And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shall keep this service in this month.
\[6]Seven days thou shall eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Jehovah.
\[7]Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days, and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy borders.
\[8]And thou shall tell thy son in that day, saying, It is because of that which Jehovah did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.
\[9]And it shall be for a sign to thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of Jehovah may be in thy mouth, for with a strong hand has Jehovah brought thee out of Egypt.
\[10]Thou shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
\[11]And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it to thee,
\[12]that thou shall set apart to Jehovah all that opens the womb. And every firstling which thou have that comes of a beast, the males shall be Jehovah's.
\[13]And every firstling of a donkey thou shall redeem with a lamb, and if thou will not redeem it, then thou shall break its neck. And all the firstborn of man among thy sons thou shall redeem.
\[14]And it shall be, when thy son asks thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shall say to him, By strength of hand Jehovah brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage.
\[15]And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that Jehovah slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast. Therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that opens the womb, being males, but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.
\[16]And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes, for by strength of hand Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt.
\[17]And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near. For God said, Lest perhaps the people regret when they see war, and they return to Egypt.
\[18]But God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea. And the sons of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.
\[19]And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had strictly sworn the sons of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones away from here with you.
\[20]And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
\[21]And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night.
\[22]The pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night departed not from before the people.

\[4]And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he shall follow after them, and I will get for me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his army, and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they did so.

\[6]And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him.
\[7]And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them.

\[9]And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal-zephon.
\[10]And when Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they were very afraid. And the sons of Israel cried out to Jehovah,
\[11]and they said to Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?
\[12]Is not this the word that we spoke to thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.
\[13]And Moses said to the people, Fear ye not. Stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will work for you today, for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more forever.
\[14]Jehovah will fight for you, and ye shall keep silent.
\[15]And Jehovah said to Moses, Why do thou cry to me? Speak to the sons of Israel, that they go forward.
\[16]And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it, and the sons of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground.
\[17]And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them, and I will get for me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his army, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
\[18]And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have gotten for me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
\[19]And the agent of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them, and the pillar of cloud moved from before them, and stood behind them.
\[20]And it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. And the cloud and the darkness was there, yet it gave light by night. And the one did not come near the other all the night.
\[21]And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Jehovah caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
\[22]And the sons of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.
\[23]And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
\[24]And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Jehovah looked forth upon the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and troubled the army of the Egyptians.
\[25]And he took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them with difficulty, so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel, for Jehovah fights for them against the Egyptians.
\[26]And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.
\[27]And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared, and the Egyptians fled against it, and Jehovah overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
\[28]And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the army of Pharaoh who went in after them into the sea, there remained not so much as one of them.
\[29]But the sons of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.
\[30]Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore.
\[31]And Israel saw the great work which Jehovah did upon the Egyptians. And the people feared Jehovah, and they believed in Jehovah, and in his servant Moses.

hen Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to Jehovah, and spoke, saying, I will sing to Jehovah, for he has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.
\[2]Jehovah is my strength and song, and he has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will praise him, my father's God, and I will exalt him.
\[3]Jehovah is a man of war. Jehovah is his name.
\[4]Pharaoh's chariots and his army he has cast into the sea, and his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.
\[5]The deeps cover them. They went down into the depths like a stone.
\[6]Thy right hand, O Jehovah, is glorious in power. Thy right hand, O Jehovah, dashes the enemy in pieces.
\[7]And in the greatness of thine excellency thou overthrow those who rise up against thee. Thou send forth thy wrath, it consumes them as stubble.
\[8]And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled up. The floods stood up as a heap. The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.
\[9]The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, my desire shall be satisfied upon them. I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
\[10]Thou did blow with thy wind, the sea covered them. They sank as lead in the mighty waters.
\[11]Who is like thee, O Jehovah, among the gods? Who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?
\[12]Thou stretched out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.
\[13]Thou in thy loving kindness have led the people that thou have redeemed. Thou have guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation.
\[14]The peoples have heard, they tremble. Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.
\[15]Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed, the mighty men of Moab. Trembling takes hold upon them. All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away.
\[16]Terror and dread falls upon them. By the greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone, till thy people pass over, O Jehovah, till the people pass over whom thou have purchased.
\[17]Thou will bring them in, and plant them on the mountain of thine inheritance, the place, O Jehovah, which thou have made for thee to dwell in, the sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.
\[18]Jehovah shall reign forever and ever.
\[19]For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon them, but the sons of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.
\[20]And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.
\[21]And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to Jehovah, for he has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.
\[22]And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur. And they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
\[23]And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Marah.
\[24]And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
\[25]And he cried to Jehovah. And Jehovah showed him a tree, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,
\[26]and he said, If thou will diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, and will do that which is right in his eyes, and will give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have put upon the Egyptians, for I am Jehovah who heals thee.

nd they took their journey from Elim. And all the congregation of the sons of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
\[2]And the whole congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness.
\[3]And the sons of Israel said to them, Would that we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, when we ate bread to the full, for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
\[4]Then Jehovah said to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.
\[5]And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
\[6]And Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel, At evening, then ye shall know that Jehovah has brought you out from the land of Egypt,
\[7]and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of Jehovah, for he hears your murmurings against Jehovah. And what are we, that ye murmur against us?
\[8]And Moses said, This shall be when Jehovah shall give you flesh to eat in the evening, and bread to the full in the morning, for that Jehovah hears your murmurings which ye murmur against him. And what are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah.
\[9]And Moses said to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, Come near before Jehovah, for he has heard your murmurings.
\[10]And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud.
\[11]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[12]I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel. Speak to them, saying, At evening ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God.
\[13]And it came to pass at evening, that the quails came up, and covered the camp. And in the morning the dew lay round about the camp,
\[14]and when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness a small round thing, small as the hoarfrost on the ground.
\[15]And when the sons of Israel saw it, they said one to another, What is it? For they knew not what it was. And Moses said to them, It is the bread which Jehovah has given you to eat.
\[16]This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded, Gather ye of it every man according to his eating, an omer a head. According to the number of your persons, ye shall take it, every man for those who are in his tent.
\[17]And the sons of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.
\[18]And when they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.
\[19]And Moses said to them, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
\[20]Notwithstanding they did not hearken to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul, and Moses was angry with them.
\[21]And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating. And when the sun grew hot, it melted.
\[22]And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
\[23]And he said to them, This is that which Jehovah has spoken, Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy sabbath to Jehovah. Bake that which ye will bake, and boil that which ye will boil, and all that remains over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
\[24]And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade, and it did not become foul, neither was there any worm in it.
\[25]And Moses said, Eat that today, for today is a sabbath to Jehovah. Today ye shall not find it in the field.
\[26]Six days ye shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the sabbath, there shall be none in it.
\[27]And it came to pass on the seventh day, that some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.
\[28]And Jehovah said to Moses, How long do ye refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?
\[29]See, because Jehovah has given you the sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Abide ye every man in his place. Let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
\[30]So the people rested on the seventh day.
\[31]And the house of Israel called the name of it Manna. And it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers with honey.
\[32]And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded. Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.
\[33]And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna in it, and lay it up before Jehovah, to be kept throughout your generations.
\[34]As Jehovah commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
\[35]And the sons of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.
\[36]Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

\[2]Therefore the people contended with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why do ye contend with me? Why do ye challenge Jehovah?
\[3]And the people thirsted there for water. And the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why have thou brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our sons and our cattle with thirst?
\[4]And Moses cried to Jehovah, saying, What shall I do to this people? They are almost ready to stone me.
\[5]And Jehovah said to Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with thee from the elders of Israel, and thy rod, with which thou smote the river, take in thy hand, and go.
\[6]Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb, and thou shall smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
\[7]And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the contending of the sons of Israel, and because they challenged Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah among us, or not?
\[8]Then Amalek came, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
\[9]And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.
\[10]So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
\[11]And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed, and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
\[12]But Moses' hands were heavy. And they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. and Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. And his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
\[13]And Joshua weakened Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
\[14]And Jehovah said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
\[15]And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi.

\[2]And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away,
\[3]and her two sons, of whom the name of the one was Gershom, for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.
\[4]And the name of the other was Eliezer, for he said, The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.
\[5]And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of God.
\[6]And he said to Moses, I, thy father-in-law Jethro, have come to thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
\[7]And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him. And they asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent.
\[8]And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how Jehovah delivered them.
\[9]And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Jehovah had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
\[10]And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
\[11]Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all gods, yea, in the thing wherein they dealt proudly against them.
\[12]And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. And Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.
\[13]And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood about Moses from the morning to the evening.
\[14]And when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou do to the people? Why do thou sit by thyself, and all the people stand about thee from morning to evening?
\[15]And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God.
\[16]When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor. And I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.
\[17]And Moses' father-in-law said to him, The thing that thou do is not good.
\[18]Thou will surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee, for the thing is too heavy for thee. Thou are not able to perform it thyself alone.
\[19]Hearken now to my voice. I will give thee counsel, and God be with thee. Be thou for the people toward God, and bring thou the cases to God.
\[20]And thou shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.
\[21]Moreover thou shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain, and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens,
\[22]and let them judge the people at all seasons. And it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring to thee, but every small matter they shall judge themselves. So shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.
\[23]If thou shall do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shall be able to endure, and all this people also shall go to their place in peace.
\[24]So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.
\[25]And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens,
\[26]and they judged the people at all seasons. The hard cases they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.

\[2]And when they were departed from Rephidim, and came to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness, and there Israel encamped before the mount.
\[3]And Moses went up to God. And Jehovah called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus thou shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the sons of Israel:
\[4]Ye have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.
\[5]Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be my own possession from among all peoples, for all the earth is mine,
\[6]and ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shall speak to the sons of Israel.
\[7]And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Jehovah commanded him.
\[8]And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah has spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people to Jehovah.
\[9]And Jehovah said to Moses, Lo, I come to thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee forever. And Moses told the words of the people to Jehovah.
\[10]And Jehovah said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,
\[11]and be ready for the third day, for the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
\[12]And thou shall set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye not go up onto the mount, or touch the border of it. Whoever touches the mount shall be surely put to death;
\[13]no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through, whether it be beast or man, he shall not live. When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mount.
\[14]And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people, and they washed their garments.
\[15]And he said to the people, Be ready for the third day. Come not near a woman.
\[16]And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of an exceedingly loud trumpet. And all the people who were in the camp trembled.
\[17]And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the lower part of the mount.
\[18]And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire, and the smoke of it ascended as the smoke of a furnace. And the whole mount quaked greatly.
\[19]And when the voice of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.
\[20]And Jehovah came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount. And Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mount, and Moses went up.
\[21]And Jehovah said to Moses, Go down, command the people, lest they break through to Jehovah to gaze, and many of them perish.
\[22]And let the priests also, who come near to Jehovah, sanctify themselves, lest Jehovah break forth upon them.
\[23]And Moses said to Jehovah, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai, for thou commanded us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.
\[24]And Jehovah said to him, Go, get thee down. And thou shall come up, thou, and Aaron with thee, but do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to Jehovah, lest he break forth upon them.

\[4]Thou shall not make to thee a graven image, nor any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
\[5]Thou shall not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them, for I, Jehovah thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, upon the third and upon the fourth generation of those who hate me,
\[6]and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.

\[8]Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
\[9]Six days thou shall labor, and do all thy work,
\[10]but the seventh day is a sabbath to Jehovah thy God. Thou shall not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates,
\[11]for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore Jehovah blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

\[18]And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking. And when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off.
\[19]And they said to Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear, but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
\[20]And Moses said to the people, Fear not, for God has come to prove you, and that his fear may be before you, that ye not sin.
\[21]And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.
\[22]And Jehovah said to Moses, Thus thou shall say to the sons of Israel, Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
\[23]Ye shall not make other gods with me; gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make to you.
\[24]An altar of earth thou shall make to me, and shall sacrifice on it thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen. In every place where I record my name I will come to thee and I will bless thee.
\[25]And if thou make to me an altar of stone, thou shall not build it of hewn stones, for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou have polluted it.

\[29]Thou shall not delay to offer from thy harvest, and from the outflow of thy presses. The firstborn of thy sons thou shall give to me.

\[14]Three times thou shall keep a feast to me in the year.
\[15]Thou shall keep the feast of unleavened bread (Seven days thou shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib, for in it thou came out from Egypt, and none shall appear before me empty),
\[16]and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labors, which thou sow in the field, and the feast of ingathering at the end of the year, when thou gather in thy labors out of the field.
\[17]Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the lord Jehovah.
\[18]Thou shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread, neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning.

\[21]Take ye heed before him, and hearken to his voice, provoke him not. For he will not pardon your transgression, for my name is in him.
\[22]But if thou shall indeed hearken to his voice, and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to thine enemies, and an adversary to thine adversaries.
\[23]For my agent shall go before thee, and bring thee in to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, and I will cut them off.
\[24]Thou shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works, but thou shall utterly overthrow them, and break their pillars in pieces.
\[25]And ye shall serve Jehovah your God, and he will bless thy bread, and thy water, and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
\[26]There shall none cast her young, nor be barren, in thy land; I will fulfill the number of thy days.
\[27]I will send my terror before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shall come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs to thee.
\[28]And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.
\[29]I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee.
\[30]Little by little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.
\[31]And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River. For I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and thou shall drive them out before thee.
\[32]Thou shall make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.
\[33]They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me, for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to thee.

\[4]And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar below the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.
\[5]And he sent young men of the sons of Israel, who offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to Jehovah.
\[6]And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins, and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
\[7]And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people. And they said, All that Jehovah has spoken will we do, and be obedient.
\[8]And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant that Jehovah has made with you concerning all these words.
\[9]Then Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up.
\[10]And they saw the God of Israel. And there was under his feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone, and as it were the very heaven for clearness.
\[11]And he laid not his hand upon the nobles of the sons of Israel. And they beheld God, and ate and drank.
\[12]And Jehovah said to Moses, Come up to me onto the mount, and be there, and I will give thee the tablets of stone, and the law and the commandment, which I have written, that thou may teach them.
\[13]And Moses rose up, and Joshua his minister, and Moses went up onto the mount of God.
\[14]And he said to the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again to you. And, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a case, let him come near to them.
\[15]And Moses went up onto the mount, and the cloud covered the mount.
\[16]And the glory of Jehovah abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And the seventh day he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud.
\[17]And the appearance of the glory of Jehovah was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the sons of Israel.

\[39]And thou shall weave the tunic in checker work of fine linen. And thou shall make a miter of fine linen. And thou shall make a sash, the work of the embroiderer.
\[40]And for Aaron's sons thou shall make tunics. And thou shall make for them sashes, and head-coverings thou shall make for them, for glory and for beauty.

\[42]And thou shall make for them linen breeches to cover the flesh of their nakedness, from the loins even to the thighs they shall reach.
\[43]And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they go in to the tent of meeting, or when they come near to the altar to minister in the holy place, that they not bear iniquity, and die. It shall be a statute forever to him and to his seed after him.

\[2]and unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened mingled with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil, of fine wheaten flour shall thou make them,
\[3]and thou shall put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.
\[4]And Aaron and his sons thou shall bring to the door of the tent of meeting, and shall wash them with water.
\[5]And thou shall take the garments, and put upon Aaron the tunic, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the skillfully woven band of the ephod.
\[6]And thou shall set the miter upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the miter.

\[8]And thou shall bring his sons, and put tunics upon them.
\[9]And thou shall gird them with sashes, Aaron and his sons, and bind head-coverings on them. And they shall have the priesthood by a perpetual statute. And thou shall consecrate Aaron and his sons.
\[10]And thou shall bring the bullock before the tent of meeting. And Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock,
\[11]and thou shall kill the bullock before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting.
\[12]And thou shall take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and thou shall pour out all the blood at the base of the altar.
\[13]And thou shall take all the fat that covers the inwards, and the caul upon the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.
\[14]But the flesh of the bullock, and its skin, and it dung, thou shall burn with fire outside the camp. It is a sin offering.
\[15]Thou shall also take the one ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram.
\[16]And thou shall slay the ram, and thou shall take its blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.
\[17]And thou shall cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its inwards, and its legs, and put them with its pieces, and with its head,
\[18]and thou shall burn the whole ram upon the altar. It is a burnt offering to Jehovah. It is a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to Jehovah.
\[19]And thou shall take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram.
\[20]Then thou shall kill the ram, and take of its blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
\[21]And thou shall take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him. And he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
\[22]Also thou shall take from the ram the fat, and the fat tail, and the fat that covers the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right thigh (for it is a ram of consecration),
\[23]and one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before Jehovah,
\[24]and thou shall put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and shall wave them for a wave offering before Jehovah.
\[25]And thou shall take them from their hands, and burn them on the altar upon the burnt offering, for a sweet savor before Jehovah. It is an offering made by fire to Jehovah.
\[26]And thou shall take the breast of Aaron's ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before Jehovah, and it shall be thy portion.
\[27]And thou shall sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the thigh of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons,
\[28]and it shall be for Aaron and his sons as their portion forever from the sons of Israel, for it is a heave offering. And it shall be a heave offering from the sons of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, even their heave offering to Jehovah.
\[29]And the holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated in them.
\[30]Seven days shall the son that is priest in his stead put them on, when he comes into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.
\[31]And thou shall take the ram of consecration, and boil its flesh in a holy place.
\[32]And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the tent of meeting.
\[33]And they shall eat those things with which atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them, but a stranger shall not eat of it, because they are holy.
\[34]And if any of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remains to the morning, then thou shall burn the remainder with fire. It shall not be eaten, because it is holy.
\[35]And thus thou shall do to Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee. Seven days thou shall consecrate them.
\[36]And every day thou shall offer the bullock of sin offering for atonement. And thou shall cleanse the altar when thou make atonement for it, and thou shall anoint it, to sanctify it.
\[37]Seven days thou shall make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it. And the altar shall be most holy. Whatever touches the altar shall be holy.
\[38]Now this is that which thou shall offer upon the altar: two lambs a year old day by day continually.
\[39]The one lamb thou shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb thou shall offer at evening.
\[40]And with the one lamb a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering.
\[41]And the other lamb thou shall offer at evening, and shall do thereto according to the meal offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering of it, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to Jehovah.
\[42]It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah, where I will meet with you, to speak to thee there.
\[43]And there I will meet with the sons of Israel, and the tent shall be sanctified by my glory.
\[44]And I will sanctify the tent of meeting, and the altar. I will also sanctify Aaron and his sons to minister to me in the priest's office.
\[45]And I will dwell among the sons of Israel, and will be their God.
\[46]And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them. I am Jehovah their God.

\[10]And Aaron shall make atonement upon the horns of it once in the year, with the blood of the sin offering of atonement. Once in the year he shall make atonement for it throughout your generations. It is most holy to Jehovah.
\[11]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[12]When thou take the sum of the sons of Israel, according to those who are numbered of them, then they shall give every man a ransom for his soul to Jehovah when thou number them, that there be no plague among them when thou number them.
\[13]This they shall give, everyone who passes over to those who are numbered: half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary, (the shekel is twenty gerahs,) half a shekel for an offering to Jehovah.
\[14]Everyone who passes over to those who are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering of Jehovah.
\[15]The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.
\[16]And thou shall take the atonement money from the sons of Israel, and shall appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting, that it may be a memorial for the sons of Israel before Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.
\[17]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[18]Thou shall also make a laver of brass, and the base of it of brass for washing. And thou shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and thou shall put water in it.
\[19]And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet there.
\[20]When they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they not die, or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire to Jehovah.
\[21]So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they not die. And it shall be a statute forever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.
\[22]Moreover Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[23]Take thou also to thee the chief spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty,
\[24]and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin.

\[28]and the altar of burnt offering with all the vessels of it, and the laver and the base of it.

\[30]And thou shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priest's office.
\[31]And thou shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil to me throughout your generations.
\[32]Upon the flesh of man it shall not be poured, neither shall ye make any like it, according to the composition of it. It is holy, and it shall be holy to you.
\[33]Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.
\[34]And Jehovah said to Moses, Take to thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum, sweet spices with pure frankincense, of each shall there be a like weight.
\[35]And thou shall make of it incense, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy.
\[36]And thou shall beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee. It shall be to you most holy.

\[3]and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
\[4]to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
\[5]and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship.
\[6]And I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. And in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee:
\[7]the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is on it, and all the furniture of the tent,
\[8]and the table and its vessels, and the pure lampstand with all its vessels, and the altar of incense,

\[11]and the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place. According to all that I have commanded thee they shall do.
\[12]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[13]Speak thou also to the sons of Israel, saying, Truly ye shall keep my sabbaths, for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that ye may know that I am Jehovah who sanctifies you.
\[14]Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death, for whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
\[15]Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Jehovah. Whoever does any work on the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.
\[16]Therefore the sons of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.
\[17]It is a sign between me and the sons of Israel forever. For in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.

nd when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, Up, make gods for us, which shall go before us. For as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has become of him.
\[2]And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.
\[3]And all the people broke off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.
\[4]And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it a molten calf. And they said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
\[5]And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it. And Aaron made proclamation, and said, Tomorrow shall be a feast to Jehovah.
\[6]And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings. And the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to revel.
\[7]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, Go, get thee down. For thy people, that thou brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.
\[8]They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made for them a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
\[9]And Jehovah said to Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people.
\[10]Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may grow hot against them, and that I may consume them. And I will make of thee a great nation.
\[11]And Moses besought Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, why does thy wrath grow hot against thy people, whom thou have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
\[12]Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, He brought them forth for evil, to kill them on the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and relent of this evil against thy people.
\[13]Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swore by thine own self, and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven. And all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your seed, and they shall inherit it forever.
\[14]And Jehovah relented of the evil which he said he would do to his people.
\[15]And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.
\[16]And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved upon the tablets.
\[17]And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.
\[18]And he said, It is not the voice of those who shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome, but the noise of those who sing do I hear.
\[19]And it came to pass, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing. And Moses' anger grew hot, and he cast the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mount.
\[20]And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it upon the water, and made the sons of Israel drink of it.
\[21]And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people do to thee, that thou have brought a great sin upon them?
\[22]And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord grow hot. Thou know the people, that they are set on evil.
\[23]For they said to me, Make gods for us, which shall go before us. For as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has become of him.
\[24]And I said to them, Whoever has any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it to me, and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.
\[25]And when Moses saw that the people were broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies,)
\[26]then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoever is on Jehovah's side, come to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.
\[27]And he said to them, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.
\[28]And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
\[29]And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves today to Jehovah, yea, every man against his son, and against his brother, that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.
\[30]And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said to the people, Ye have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to Jehovah, perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin.
\[31]And Moses returned to Jehovah, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made gods of gold for them.
\[32]Yet now, if thou will forgive their sin-, and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou have written.
\[33]And Jehovah said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
\[34]And now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to thee. Behold, my agent shall go before thee. Nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.
\[35]And Jehovah smote the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.

\[2]And I will send an agent before thee, and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite-
\[3]to a land flowing with milk and honey. For I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume thee on the way.
\[4]And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned, and no man put his ornaments on him.
\[5]And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to the sons of Israel, Ye are a stiff-necked people. If I go up into the midst of thee for one moment, I shall consume thee. Therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do to thee.
\[6]And the sons of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb onward.
\[7]Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp, afar off from the camp, and he called it, The tent of meeting. And it came to pass, that everyone who sought Jehovah went out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.
\[8]And it came to pass, when Moses went out to the tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tent.
\[9]And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the tent, and Jehovah spoke with Moses.
\[10]And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the tent. And all the people rose up and worshiped, every man at his tent door.
\[11]And Jehovah spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend, and he turned again into the camp. But his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, did not depart out of the tent.
\[12]And Moses said to Jehovah, See, thou say to me, Bring up this people, and thou have not let me know whom thou will send with me. Yet thou have said, I know thee by name, and thou have also found favor in my sight.
\[13]Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thy sight, show me now thy ways, that I may know thee, to the end that I may find favor in thy sight. And consider that this nation is thy people.
\[14]And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.
\[15]And Moses said to him, If thy presence go not, do not carry us up from here.
\[16]For how shall it now be known that I have found favor in thy sight, I and thy people? Is it not in that thou go with us, so that we are separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth?
\[17]And Jehovah said to Moses, I will do this thing also that thou have spoken, for thou have found favor in my sight, and I know thee by name.
\[18]And he said, Show me, I pray thee, thy glory.
\[19]And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and will proclaim the name of Jehovah before thee. I will be merciful to whom I may be merciful, and I will be compassionate to whomever I may be compassionate.
\[20]And he said, Thou cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live.
\[21]And Jehovah said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shall stand upon the rock.
\[22]And it shall come to pass, while my glory passes by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand until I have passed by.

\[2]And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount.
\[3]And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount, neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.
\[4]And he hewed two tablets of stone like the first. And Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him, and took in his hand two tablets of stone.
\[5]And Jehovah descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.
\[6]And Jehovah passed by before him, and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth,
\[7]keeping loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, and upon the sons's sons, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.
\[8]And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.
\[9]And he said, If now I have found favor in thy sight, O Lord, let the Lord, I pray thee, go in the midst of us, for it is a stiff-necked people, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.
\[10]And he said, Behold, I make a covenant. Before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation, and all the people among which thou are shall see the work of Jehovah, for it is an awesome thing that I do with thee.
\[11]Observe thou that which I command thee this day. Behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
\[12]Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where thou go, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee.
\[13]But ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim,
\[14]for thou shall worship no other god. For Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
\[15]Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they play the harlot after their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and a man calls thee and thou eat of his sacrifice,
\[16]and thou take of their daughters to thy sons, and their daughters play the harlot after their gods, and make thy sons play the harlot after their gods.
\[17]Thou shall make thee no molten gods.
\[18]Thou shall keep the feast of unleavened bread. Seven days thou shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib, for in the month Abib thou came out from Egypt.
\[19]All that opens the womb is mine, and all thy cattle that is male, the firstlings of cow and sheep.
\[20]And the firstling of a donkey thou shall redeem with a lamb, and if thou will not redeem it, then thou shall break its neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shall redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.
\[21]Six days thou shall work, but on the seventh day thou shall rest; in plowing time and in harvest thou shall rest.
\[22]And thou shall observe the feast of weeks, even of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering in the middle of the year.
\[23]Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the lord Jehovah, the God of Israel.
\[24]For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders. Neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou go up to appear before Jehovah thy God three times in the year.
\[25]Thou shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread, nor shall the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover be left to the morning.
\[26]The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shall bring to the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.
\[27]And Jehovah said to Moses, Write thou these words, for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.
\[28]And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights. He neither ate bread, nor drank water, and he wrote upon the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
\[29]And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.
\[30]And when Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him.
\[31]And Moses called to them. And Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke to them.
\[32]And afterward all the sons of Israel came near, and he gave them in commandment all that Jehovah had spoken with him on mount Sinai.
\[33]And when Moses was done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.
\[34]But when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out. And he came out, and spoke to the sons of Israel that which he was commanded.
\[35]And the sons of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone. And Moses put the veil upon his face again until he went in to speak with him.

\[2]Six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of solemn rest to Jehovah. Whoever does any work in it shall be put to death.
\[3]Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.
\[4]And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded, saying,
\[5]Take ye from among you an offering to Jehovah. Whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it-Jehovah's offering: gold, and silver, and brass,
\[6]and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,
\[7]and rams' skins dyed red, and certain skins, and acacia wood,
\[8]and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,
\[9]and onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate.
\[10]And let every wise-hearted man among you come, and make all that Jehovah has commanded:
\[11]the tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its clasps, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets,
\[12]the ark, and the staves of it, the mercy-seat, and the veil of the screen,
\[13]the table, and its staves, and all its vessels, and the showbread,
\[14]the lampstand also for the light, and its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil for the light,
\[15]and the altar of incense, and its staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle,

\[19]the finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.
\[20]And all the congregation of the sons of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
\[21]And they came, everyone whose heart stirred him up, and everyone whom his spirit made willing, and brought Jehovah's offering, for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all the service of it, and for the holy garments.
\[22]And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, and brought brooches, and earrings, and signet-rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold, even every man who offered an offering of gold to Jehovah.
\[23]And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and rams' skins dyed red, and certain skins, brought them.
\[24]Everyone who offered an offering of silver and brass brought Jehovah's offering, and every man, with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it.
\[25]And all the women who were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought that which they had spun: the blue, and the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen.
\[26]And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats' hair.
\[27]And the rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate,
\[28]and the spice, and the oil, for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.
\[29]The sons of Israel brought a freewill offering to Jehovah, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which Jehovah had commanded to be made by Moses.
\[30]And Moses said to the sons of Israel, See, Jehovah has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
\[31]And he has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
\[32]and to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
\[33]and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of skilful workmanship.
\[34]And he has put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
\[35]He has filled them with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of workmanship, of the engraver, and of the skilful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of those who do any workmanship, and of those who devise skilful works.

nd Bezalel and Oholiab shall work, and every wise-hearted man, in whom Jehovah has put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that Jehovah has commanded.
\[2]And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart Jehovah had put wisdom, even everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to the work to do it,
\[3]and they received from Moses all the offering which the sons of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, with which to make it. And they brought yet to him freewill offerings every morning.
\[4]And all the wise men, who wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they wrought.
\[5]And they spoke to Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which Jehovah commanded to make.
\[6]And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.
\[7]For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
\[8]And all the wise-hearted men among them who wrought the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains, of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim; the work of the skilful workman made them.
\[9]The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. All the curtains had one measure.
\[10]And he coupled five curtains one to another, and the other five curtains he coupled one to another.
\[11]And he made loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling. Likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling.
\[12]Fifty loops he made in the one curtain, and fifty loops he made in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling; the loops were opposite one to another.
\[13]And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps, so the tabernacle was one.
\[14]And he made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle. Eleven curtains he made them.

\[21]Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board.
\[22]Each board had two tenons, joined one to another. Thus he made for all the boards of the tabernacle.
\[23]And he made the boards for the tabernacle. Twenty boards for the south side southward.
\[24]And he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards, two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.

\[26]and their forty sockets of silver, two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.

\[28]And he made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part.
\[29]And they were double beneath, and in like manner they were entire to the top of it to one ring. Thus he did to both of them in the two corners.
\[30]And there were eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets, under every board two sockets.
\[31]And he made bars of acacia wood, five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,
\[32]and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward.
\[33]And he made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the one end to the other.
\[34]And he overlaid the boards with gold. And made their rings of gold for places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
\[35]And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. He made it with cherubim, the work of the skilful workman.
\[36]And he made for it four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold. Their hooks were of gold, and he cast for them four sockets of silver.
\[37]And he made a screen for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer,
\[38]and the five pillars of it with their hooks. And he overlaid their capitals and their bands with gold, and their five sockets were of brass.

\[5]And thou shall set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.
\[6]And thou shall set the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
\[7]And thou shall set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shall put water in it.

\[16]Thus did Moses. According to all that Jehovah commanded him, so did he.
\[17]And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was raised up.
\[18]And Moses raised up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up the boards of it, and put in the bars of it, and raised up its pillars.
\[19]And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
\[20]And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark.
\[21]And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
\[22]And he put the table in the tent of meeting, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, outside the veil.
\[23]And he set the bread in order upon it before Jehovah, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
\[24]And he put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.
\[25]And he lit the lamps before Jehovah, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
\[26]And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil,
\[27]and he burnt incense of sweet spices on it, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
\[28]And he put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.
\[29]And he set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meal offering, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
\[30]And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it, with which to wash.
\[31]And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet there.
\[32]They washed when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near to the altar, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
\[33]And he raised up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.
\[34]Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.
\[35]And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereupon, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.
\[36]And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the sons of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys,
\[37]but if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not journey till the day that it was taken up.
\[38]For the cloud of Jehovah was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.

\[31]And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
\[32]And that which remains of the flesh and of the bread ye shall burn with fire.
\[33]And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled, for he shall consecrate you seven days.
\[34]As has been done this day, so Jehovah has commanded to do, to make atonement for you.
\[35]And ye shall remain at the door of the tent of meeting day and night seven days, and keep the charge of Jehovah, that ye not die, for so I am commanded.

nd it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel,
\[2]and he said to Aaron, Take thee a calf of the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before Jehovah.
\[3]And thou shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, Take ye a he-goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt offering,
\[4]and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah, and a meal offering mingled with oil. For today Jehovah appears to you.
\[5]And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting, and all the congregation drew near and stood before Jehovah.
\[6]And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded that ye should do, and the glory of Jehovah shall appear to you.
\[7]And Moses said to Aaron, Draw near to the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people. And offer the oblation of the people, and make atonement for them, as Jehovah commanded.
\[8]So Aaron drew near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
\[9]And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar,
\[10]but he burnt the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul from the liver of the sin offering, upon the altar, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
\[11]And he burnt the flesh and the skin with fire outside the camp.
\[12]And he killed the burnt offering. And Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about.
\[13]And they delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head, and he burnt them upon the altar.
\[14]And he washed the innards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.
\[15]And he presented the people's oblation. And took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
\[16]And he presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.
\[17]And he presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from it, and burnt it upon the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.
\[18]He also killed the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people. And Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,
\[19]and the fat of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the caul of the liver.
\[20]And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar.
\[21]And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before Jehovah, as Moses commanded.
\[22]And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them. And he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.
\[23]And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people. And the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the people.
\[24]And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.

nd Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each of them took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and offered strange fire before Jehovah, which he had not commanded them.
\[2]And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and devoured them, and they died before Jehovah.
\[3]Then Moses said to Aaron, This is it that Jehovah spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in those who come near me. And I will be glorified before all the people. And Aaron remained silent.
\[4]And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Draw near. Carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
\[5]So they drew near, and carried them in their tunics out of the camp, as Moses had said.
\[6]And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither tear your clothes, that ye not die, and that he not be angry with all the congregation, but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Jehovah has kindled.
\[7]And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die, for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
\[8]And Jehovah spoke to Aaron, saying,
\[9]Drink no wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, that ye not die-it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations-
\[10]and that ye may make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean,
\[11]and that ye may teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah has spoken to them by Moses.
\[12]And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, Take the meal offering that remains of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar, for it is most holy.
\[13]And ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy portion, and thy sons' portion, of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire. For so I am commanded.
\[14]And ye shall eat the wave-breast and the heave-thigh in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee. For they are given as thy portion, and thy sons' portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the sons of Israel.
\[15]They shall bring the heave-thigh and the wave-breast with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before Jehovah, and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, as a portion forever, as Jehovah has commanded.
\[16]And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt. And he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,
\[17]Why have ye not eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and he has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Jehovah?
\[18]Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary inside. Ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.
\[19]And Aaron spoke to Moses, Behold, this day they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before Jehovah, and there have befallen me such things as these. And if I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been well-pleasing in the sight of Jehovah?
\[20]And when Moses heard, it was well-pleasing in his sight.

\[4]Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of those that chew the cud, or of those that part the hoof: the camel, because he chews the cud but does not part the hoof, he is unclean to you.
\[5]And the coney, because he chews the cud but does not part the hoof, he is unclean to you.
\[6]And the hare, because she chews the cud but does not part the hoof, she is unclean to you.

\[10]And all that have no fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an abomination to you,
\[11]and they shall be an abomination to you. Ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses ye shall have in abomination.

\[3]And the priest shall look on the disease in the skin of the flesh, and if the hair in the disease has turned white, and the appearance of the disease is deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a leprous disease. And the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.
\[4]And if the bright spot is white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance of it is not deeper than the skin, and the hair of it has not turned white, then the priest shall shut up the disease seven days.
\[5]And the priest shall look on him the seventh day, and, behold, if in his eyes the disease is arrested, and the disease is not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more.
\[6]And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day, and, behold, if the disease is dim, and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. It is a scab, and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
\[7]But if the scab spreads abroad in the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again.
\[8]And the priest shall look, and, behold, if the scab is spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a leprous disease.
\[9]When the leprous disease is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest.
\[10]And the priest shall look, and, behold, if there is a white rising in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and there is quick raw flesh in the rising,
\[11]it is an old leprous disease in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. He shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.
\[12]And if the leprous disease breaks out abroad in the skin, and the leprous disease covers all the skin of the disease from his head even to his feet, as far as appears to the priest,
\[13]then the priest shall look. And, behold, if the leprous disease has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean of the disease. It is all turned white; he is clean.
\[14]But whenever raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean.
\[15]And the priest shall look on the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean. The raw flesh is unclean; it is a leprous disease.
\[16]Or if the raw flesh turns again, and is changed to white, then he shall come to the priest.
\[17]And the priest shall look on him, and, behold, if the disease is turned into white, then the priest shall pronounce him clean of the disease; he is clean.
\[18]And when the flesh has a boil in the skin of it, and it is healed,
\[19]and in the place of the boil there is a white rising, or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it shall be shown to the priest.
\[20]And the priest shall look, and, behold, if the appearance of it is deeper than the skin, and the hair of it has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a leprous disease; it has broken out in the boil.

\[22]And if it spreads abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a disease.
\[23]But if the bright spot stays in its place, and has not spread, it is the scar of the boil, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
\[24]Or when the flesh has a burning by fire in the skin of it, and the quick of the burning become a bright spot, reddish-white, or white,
\[25]then the priest shall look upon it. And, behold, if the hair in the bright spot has turned white, and the appearance of it is deeper than the skin, it is a leprous disease. It has broken out in the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous disease.

\[35]then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, There seems to me to be as it were a disease in the house.
\[36]And the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest goes in to see the disease, that all that is in the house not be made unclean. And afterward the priest shall go in to see the house,
\[37]and he shall look on the disease. And, behold, if the disease is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and the appearance of it is deeper than the wall surface,
\[38]then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.
\[39]And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look. And, behold, if the disease has spread in the walls of the house,
\[40]then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the disease is, and cast them into an unclean place outside the city.
\[41]And he shall cause the house to be scraped inside round about, and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scrape off, outside the city into an unclean place.
\[42]And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones. And he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.
\[43]And if the disease comes again, and breaks out in the house, after he has taken out the stones, and after he has scraped the house, and after it is plastered,
\[44]then the priest shall come in and look. And, behold, if the disease has spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean.
\[45]And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber of it, and all the mortar of the house, and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.
\[46]Moreover he who goes into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening.
\[47]And he who lies in the house shall wash his clothes. And he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.
\[48]And if the priest shall come in, and look, and, behold, the disease has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the disease is healed.
\[49]And he shall take two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop to cleanse the house.
\[50]And he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.
\[51]And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.
\[52]And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet,
\[53]but he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field. So he shall make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean.
\[54]This is the law for all manner of a leprous disease, and for a scall,
\[55]and for a leprous disease of a garment, and for a house,
\[56]and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot,
\[57]to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean. This is the law of a leprous disease.

\[2]and Jehovah said to Moses, Speak to Aaron thy brother, that he not come at all times into the holy place within the veil, before the mercy-seat which is upon the ark, that he not die, for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy-seat.
\[3]Aaron shall come into the holy place this way: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.
\[4]He shall put on the holy linen tunic, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with the linen sash, and he shall be attired with the linen miter. They are the holy garments, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and put them on.
\[5]And he shall take from the congregation of the sons of Israel two he-goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.
\[6]And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself, and for his house.
\[7]And he shall take the two goats, and set them before Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting.
\[8]And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats, one lot for Jehovah, and the other lot for the scapegoat.
\[9]And Aaron shall present the goat upon which the lot fell for Jehovah, and offer him for a sin offering.
\[10]But the goat, on which the lot fell for the scapegoat, shall be set alive before Jehovah, to make atonement for him, to send him away for the scapegoat into the wilderness.
\[11]And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself.
\[12]And he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Jehovah, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil.
\[13]And he shall put the incense upon the fire before Jehovah, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat that is upon the testimony, that he not die.
\[14]And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy-seat on the east. And he shall sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times before the mercy-seat.
\[15]Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat.
\[16]And he shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleannesses of the sons of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins. And so he shall do for the tent of meeting that dwells with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.
\[17]And there shall be no man in the tent of meeting when he goes in to make atonement in the holy place until he comes out, and has made atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel.
\[18]And he shall go out to the altar that is before Jehovah, and make atonement for it. And shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.
\[19]And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the sons of Israel.

\[21]And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the sons of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins. And he shall put them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a man who is in readiness into the wilderness.
\[22]And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities to a solitary land. And he shall let the goat go in the wilderness.
\[23]And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there.
\[24]And he shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people.
\[25]And he shall burn upon the altar the fat of the sin offering.
\[26]And he who lets the goat go for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
\[27]And the bullock of the sin offering, and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be carried forth outside the camp, and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.

\[30]For on this day atonement shall be made for you, to cleanse you. Ye shall be clean from all your sins before Jehovah.
\[31]It is a sabbath of solemn rest to you, and ye shall afflict your souls. It is a statute forever.
\[32]And the priest, who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to be priest in his father's stead, shall make the atonement. And he shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments,
\[33]and shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar, and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.

\[5]to the end that the sons of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them to Jehovah, to the door of the tent of meeting, to the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace offerings to Jehovah.
\[6]And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting, and burn the fat for a sweet savor to Jehovah.
\[7]And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to the he-goats, after which they play the harlot. This shall be a statute forever to them throughout their generations.

\[9]and does not bring it to the door of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it to Jehovah, that man shall be cut off from his people.
\[10]And whatever man there is of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, who eats any manner of blood, I will set my face against that soul who eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.
\[11]For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life.
\[12]Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, nor shall any stranger that sojourns among you eat blood.
\[13]And whatever man there is of the sons of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, who takes any beast or bird in hunting that may be eaten, he shall pour out the blood of it, and cover it with dust.
\[14]For as to the life of all flesh, the blood of it is with the life of it. Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh, for the life of all flesh is the blood of it. Whoever eats it shall be cut off.
\[15]And every soul who eats that which dies of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening, then he shall be clean.

\[4]He shall not defile himself, who is a chief man among his people, to profane himself.
\[5]They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
\[6]They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of their God. For they offer the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, the bread of their God. Therefore they shall be holy.
\[7]They shall not take a woman who is a harlot, or profane, neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband, for he is holy to his God.
\[8]Thou shall sanctify him therefore, for he offers the bread of thy God. He shall be holy to thee, for I Jehovah, who sanctify you, am holy.
\[9]And the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by playing the harlot, she profanes her father. She shall be burnt with fire.
\[10]And he who is the high priest among his brothers, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and who is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor tear his clothes,
\[11]neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother,
\[12]neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God, for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him. I am Jehovah.
\[13]And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
\[14]A widow, or one divorced, or a profane woman, a harlot, these he shall not take, but he shall take to wife a virgin of his own people.
\[15]And he shall not profane his seed among his people, for I am Jehovah who sanctifies him.
\[16]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[17]Speak to Aaron, saying, Whoever he is of thy seed throughout their generations who has a blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.
\[18]For whatever man he is who has a blemish, he shall not approach: not a blind man, or a lame man, or he who has a flat nose, or anything superfluous,
\[19]or a man who is broken-footed, or broken-handed,
\[20]or crook-backed, or a dwarf, or who has a blemish in his eye, or is scurvy, or scabbed, or has his testicles broken.
\[21]No man of the seed of Aaron the priest, who has a blemish, shall come near to offer the offerings of Jehovah made by fire; he has a blemish, he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.
\[22]He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy,
\[23]only he shall not go in to the veil, nor come near to the altar, because he has a blemish, that he not profane my sanctuaries, for I am Jehovah who sanctifies them.
\[24]So Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel.

\[2]Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they hallow to me, and that they not profane my holy name. I am Jehovah.
\[3]Say to them, Whoever he is of all your seed throughout your generations, that approaches to the holy things, which the sons of Israel hallow to Jehovah, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before me. I am Jehovah.
\[4]Whatever man of the seed of Aaron being a man with a leprous disease, or has an issue, he shall not eat of the holy things until he is clean. And whoever touches anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goes from him,
\[5]or whoever touches any creeping thing, by which he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatever uncleanness he has,
\[6]the soul that touches any such shall be unclean until the evening. And shall not eat of the holy things unless he bathe his flesh in water.
\[7]And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.
\[8]That which dies of itself, or is torn by beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself with it. I am Jehovah.
\[9]They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die in it if they profane it. I am Jehovah who sanctifies them.
\[10]There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing. A sojourner of the priest's, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.
\[11]But if a priest buys any soul, the purchase of his money, he shall eat of it, and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread.
\[12]And if a priest's daughter be married to a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave offering of the holy things.
\[13]But if a priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned to her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's bread, but there shall no stranger eat of it.
\[14]And if a man eats of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part of it to it, and shall give the holy thing to the priest.
\[15]And they shall not profane the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they offer to Jehovah,
\[16]and so cause them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt when they eat their holy things, for I am Jehovah who sanctifies them.
\[17]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[18]Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, and say to them, Whoever he is of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, who offers his oblation, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill offerings, which they offer to Jehovah for a burnt offering,
\[19]that ye may be accepted, ye shall offer a male without blemish, of the bullocks, of the sheep, or of the goats.
\[20]But whatever has a blemish, that ye shall not offer, for it shall not be acceptable for you.
\[21]And whoever offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to Jehovah to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish in it.
\[22]Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a skin tumor, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these to Jehovah, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar to Jehovah.
\[23]Either a bullock or a lamb that has anything superfluous or lacking in his parts, that thou may offer for a freewill offering, but it shall not be accepted for a vow.
\[24]That which has its testicles bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, ye shall not offer to Jehovah, neither shall ye do thus in your land.
\[25]Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these, because their corruption is in them; there is a blemish in them. They shall not be accepted for you.
\[26]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[27]When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam, and from the eighth day and after that it shall be accepted for the oblation of an offering made by fire to Jehovah.
\[28]And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day.
\[29]And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Jehovah, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted.
\[30]It shall be eaten on the same day. Ye shall leave none of it until the morning. I am Jehovah.
\[31]Therefore ye shall keep my commandments, and do them. I am Jehovah.
\[32]And ye shall not profane my holy name, but I will be hallowed among the sons of Israel. I am Jehovah who hallows you,
\[33]who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. I am Jehovah.

\[3]Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation. Ye shall do no manner of work. It is a sabbath to Jehovah in all your dwellings.
\[4]These are the set feasts of Jehovah, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season:

\[11]And he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah, to be accepted for you. On the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
\[12]And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt offering to Jehovah.
\[13]And the meal offering of it shall be two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire to Jehovah for a sweet savor. And the drink offering of it shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.
\[14]And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your God. It is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
\[15]And ye shall count to you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering, there shall be complete seven sabbaths.
\[16]Ye shall number fifty days, even to the morrow after the seventh sabbath, and ye shall offer a new meal offering to Jehovah.
\[17]Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves of two tenth parts of an ephah. They shall be of fine flour. They shall be baked with leaven, for first-fruits to Jehovah.
\[18]And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, and one young bullock, and two rams. They shall be a burnt offering to Jehovah, with their meal offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Jehovah.
\[19]And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin offering, and two he-lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace offerings.

\[21]And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day, there shall be a holy convocation to you. Ye shall do no job work. It is a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
\[22]And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shall not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shall thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest. Thou shall leave them for the poor man, and for the sojourner. I am Jehovah your God.

\[28]And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day, for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before Jehovah your God.
\[29]For whatever soul it be who shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from his people.
\[30]And whatever soul it be who does any manner of work in that same day, that soul I will destroy from among his people.

\[9]And it shall be for Aaron and his sons. And they shall eat it in a holy place, for it is most holy to him of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire by a perpetual statute.
\[10]And the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the sons of Israel. And the son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp,
\[11]and the son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed. And they brought him to Moses. And his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.

\[15]And thou shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.
\[16]And he who blasphemes the name of Jehovah, he shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall certainly stone him. As well the sojourner, as the home-born, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.

\[3]Six years thou shall sow thy field, and six years thou shall prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruits of it,
\[4]but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath to Jehovah. Thou shall neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
\[5]That which grows of itself of thy harvest thou shall not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shall not gather. It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.
\[6]And the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you: for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger, who sojourns with thee.
\[7]And for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, all the increase of it shall be for food.
\[8]And thou shall number seven sabbaths of years to thee, seven times seven years, and there shall be to thee the days of seven sabbaths of years, even forty-nine years.
\[9]Then thou shall send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. In the day of atonement ye shall send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land.
\[10]And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants of it. It shall be a jubilee to you, and ye shall return every man to his possession, and ye shall return every man to his family.
\[11]That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you. Ye shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself in it, nor gather in it of the undressed vines.
\[12]For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. Ye shall eat the increase of it out of the field.
\[13]In this year of jubilee ye shall return every man to his possession.
\[14]And if thou sell anything to thy neighbor, or buy of thy neighbor's hand, ye shall not wrong each other.
\[15]According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shall buy of thy neighbor, and according to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to thee.
\[16]According to the multitude of the years thou shall increase the price of it, and according to the fewness of the years thou shall diminish the price of it, for the number of the crops he sells to thee.
\[17]And ye shall not wrong each other, but thou shall fear thy God, for I am Jehovah your God.
\[18]Therefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my ordinances and do them, and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
\[19]And the land shall yield its fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell in safety in it.
\[20]And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase,
\[21]then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years.
\[22]And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old storage, until the ninth year. Until its fruits come in, ye shall eat the old storage.
\[23]And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine. For ye are strangers and sojourners with me.
\[24]And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
\[25]If thy brother becomes poor, and sells some of his possession, then his kinsman who is next to him shall come, and shall redeem that which his brother has sold.
\[26]And if a man has no one to redeem it, and he becomes rich and finds sufficient to redeem it,
\[27]then let him reckon the years of the sale of it, and restore the excess to the man to whom he sold it, and he shall return to his possession.
\[28]But if he is not able to get it back for himself, then that which he has sold shall remain in the hand of him who has bought it until the year of jubilee. And in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.
\[29]And if a man sells a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold. For a full year he shall have the right of redemption.
\[30]And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations. It shall not go out in the jubilee.
\[31]But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country. They may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.
\[32]Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, the Levites may redeem at any time.
\[33]And if a man purchases from the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee. For the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel.
\[34]But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold, for it is their perpetual possession.
\[35]And if thy brother becomes poor, and his hand fails with thee, then thou shall uphold him; he shall live with thee as a stranger and a sojourner.
\[36]Take thou no interest from him or increase, but fear thy God, that thy brother may live with thee.
\[37]Thou shall not give him thy money upon interest, nor give him thy food for profit.
\[38]I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.

\[40]He shall be with thee as a hired servant, and as a sojourner. He shall serve with thee to the year of jubilee.
\[41]Then he shall go out from thee, he and his sons with him, and shall return to his own family. And he shall return to the possession of his fathers.
\[42]For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt. They shall not be sold as bondmen.
\[43]Thou shall not rule over him with rigor, but shall fear thy God.
\[44]And as for thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, whom thou shall have, from the nations that are round about you, ye shall buy bondmen and bondmaids from them.
\[45]Moreover of the sons of the strangers who sojourn among you, ye shall buy from them, and from their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land, and they shall be your possession.
\[46]And ye shall make them an inheritance for your sons after you, to hold for a possession. Ye shall take your permanent bondmen from them, but over your brothers the sons of Israel ye shall not rule, one over another, with rigor.

\[48]he may be redeemed after he is sold. One of his brothers may redeem him.
\[49]Or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him. Or any who is near of kin to him of his family may redeem him. Or if he becomes rich, he may redeem himself.
\[50]And he shall reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the year of jubilee. And the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years. He shall be with him according to the time of a hired servant.
\[51]If there be yet many years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
\[52]And if there remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him. He shall give back the price of his redemption according to his years.
\[53]He shall be with him as a servant hired year by year. He shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.
\[54]And if he is not redeemed by these means, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his sons with him.

\[42]then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember, and I will remember the land.
\[43]The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them. And they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity, because, even because they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.
\[44]And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them, for I am Jehovah their God,
\[45]but for their sakes I will remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am Jehovah.
\[46]These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Jehovah made between him and the sons of Israel at mount Sinai by Moses.

nd Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[2]Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When a man shall accomplish a vow, the persons shall be for Jehovah by thy estimation.
\[3]And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
\[4]And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
\[5]And if it be from five years old even to twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
\[6]And if it be from a month old even to five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.
\[7]And if it be from sixty years old and upward, if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
\[8]But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him who vowed shall the priest value him.
\[9]And if it be a beast, of which men offer an oblation to Jehovah, all that any man gives of such to Jehovah shall be holy.
\[10]He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good. And if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.
\[11]And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation to Jehovah, then he shall set the beast before the priest,
\[12]and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad. As thou the priest values it, so shall it be.
\[13]But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to thy estimation.
\[14]And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to Jehovah, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad. As the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
\[15]And if he who sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation to it, and it shall be his.
\[16]And if a man shall sanctify to Jehovah part of the field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the sowing of it, the sowing of a homer of barley at fifty shekels of silver.
\[17]If he sanctifies his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
\[18]But if he sanctifies his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the year of jubilee, and an abatement shall be made from thy estimation.
\[19]And if he who sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation to it, and it shall be assured to him.
\[20]And if he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more,
\[21]but the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy to Jehovah, as a field set apart; the possession of it shall be the priest's.
\[22]And if he sanctifies to Jehovah a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession,
\[23]then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of thy estimation to the year of jubilee, and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing to Jehovah.
\[24]In the year of jubilee the field shall return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs.
\[25]And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
\[26]Only the firstling among beasts, which is made a firstling to Jehovah, no man shall sanctify it, whether it be ox or sheep, it is Jehovah's.
\[27]And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thine estimation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it, or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
\[28]Notwithstanding, nothing set apart, that a man shall set apart to Jehovah of all that he has, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed; everything set apart is most holy to Jehovah.
\[29]No one set apart, who shall be set apart from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
\[30]And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is Jehovah's; it is holy to Jehovah.
\[31]And if a man will redeem any of his tithe, he shall add to it the fifth part of it.
\[32]And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to Jehovah.
\[33]He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it. And if he changes it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
\[34]These are the commandments, which Jehovah commanded Moses for the sons of Israel at mount Sinai.

\[46]even all those who were numbered were six hundred three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

\[49]Only the tribe of Levi thou shall not number, neither shall thou take the sum of them among the sons of Israel,
\[50]but appoint thou the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all the furniture of it, and over all that belongs to it. They shall bear the tabernacle, and all the furniture of it, and they shall minister to it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.
\[51]And when the tabernacle sets forward, the Levites shall take it down, and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up. And the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.
\[52]And the sons of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their armies.
\[53]But the Levites shall encamp round about the tabernacle of the testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the sons of Israel. And the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony.

\[2]Command the sons of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every man who has an issue, and whoever is unclean about life.
\[3]Ye shall put out both male and female. Ye shall put them outside the camp, that they not defile their camp, in the midst of which I dwell.
\[4]And the sons of Israel did so, and put them outside the camp. As Jehovah spoke to Moses, so did the sons of Israel.
\[5]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[6]Speak to the sons of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, so as to trespass against Jehovah, and that soul shall be guilty,
\[7]then he shall confess his sin which he has done. And he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add to it the fifth part of it, and give it to him in respect of whom he has been guilty.
\[8]But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made to Jehovah shall be the priest's, besides the ram of the atonement, by which atonement shall be made for him.
\[9]And every heave offering of all the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they present to the priest, shall be his.
\[10]And every man's hallowed things shall be his. Whatever any man gives the priest, it shall be his.
\[11]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[12]Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, If any man's wife goes aside, and commits a trespass against him,
\[13]and a man lies with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, and she is not taken in the act,
\[14]and the spirit of jealousy comes upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled, or if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she is not defiled,
\[15]then the man shall bring his wife to the priest, and shall bring her oblation for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal. He shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense on it, for it is a meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
\[16]And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before Jehovah.
\[17]And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel. And the priest shall take of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle, and put it into the water.
\[18]And the priest shall set the woman before Jehovah, and let the hair of the woman's head go loose, and put the meal offering of memorial in her hands, which is the meal offering of jealousy. And the priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that causes the curse.
\[19]And the priest shall cause her to swear, and shall say to the woman, If no man has lain with thee, and if thou have not gone aside to uncleanness, being under thy husband, be thou free from this water of bitterness that causes the curse.
\[20]But if thou have gone aside, being under thy husband, and if thou are defiled, and some man has lain with thee besides thy husband,
\[21]then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say to the woman, Jehovah make thee a curse and an oath among thy people when Jehovah makes thy thigh to fall away, and thy body to swell.
\[22]And this water that causes the curse shall go into thy bowels, and make thy body to swell, and thy thigh to fall away. And the woman shall say, Truly, Truly.
\[23]And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness.
\[24]And he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causes the curse. And the water that causes the curse shall enter into her bitter.
\[25]And the priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the meal offering before Jehovah, and bring it to the altar.
\[26]And the priest shall take a handful of the meal offering, as the memorial of it, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water.
\[27]And when he has made her drink the water, then it shall come to pass, if she is defiled, and has committed a trespass against her husband, that the water that causes the curse shall enter into her bitter, and her body shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away. And the woman shall be a curse among her people.
\[28]And if the woman is not defiled, but is clean, then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.
\[29]This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband, goes aside, and is defiled,
\[30]or when the spirit of jealousy comes upon a man, and he is jealous of his wife. Then he shall set the woman before Jehovah, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.

\[3]he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink. He shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.
\[4]All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is made of the grapevine, from the kernels even to the husk.
\[5]All the days of his vow of separation there shall no razor come upon his head. Until the days be fulfilled, in which he separates himself to Jehovah, he shall be holy. He shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.
\[6]He shall not come near to a dead body all the days that he separates himself to Jehovah.
\[7]He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die, because his separation to God is upon his head.
\[8]All the days of his separation he is holy to Jehovah.
\[9]And if any man dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles the head of his separation, then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he shall shave it.
\[10]And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting.
\[11]And the priest shall offer one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, because he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.
\[12]And he shall separate to Jehovah the days of his separation, and shall bring a he-lamb a year old for a trespass offering. But the former days shall be void, because his separation was defiled.
\[13]And this is the law of the Nazirite when the days of his separation are fulfilled: He shall be brought to the door of the tent of meeting,
\[14]and he shall offer his oblation to Jehovah: one he-lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,
\[15]and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal offering, and their drink offerings.
\[16]And the priest shall present them before Jehovah, and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering.
\[17]And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to Jehovah, with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest shall also offer the meal offering of it, and the drink offering of it.
\[18]And the Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings.
\[19]And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazirite, after he has shaven his separation,
\[20]and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before Jehovah. This is holy for the priest, together with the wave-breast and heave-thigh. And after that the Nazirite may drink wine.
\[21]This is the law of the Nazirite who vows, and of his oblation to Jehovah for his separation, besides that which he is able to get. According to his vow which he vows, so he must do after the law of his separation.
\[22]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[23]Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This way ye shall bless the sons of Israel: Ye shall say to them,
\[24]Jehovah bless thee, and keep thee.
\[25]Jehovah make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious to thee.

\[11]In the second month on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it. They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
\[12]They shall leave none of it to the morning, nor break a bone of it. According to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it.
\[13]But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbears to keep the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people, because he did not offer the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season; that man shall bear his sin.
\[14]And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the Passover to Jehovah, according to the statute of the Passover, and according to the ordinance of it, so shall he do. Ye shall have one statute, both for the sojourner, and for him who is born in the land.

\[16]So it was always: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.
\[17]And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tent, then after that the sons of Israel journeyed. And in the place where the cloud abode, there the sons of Israel encamped.
\[18]At the commandment of Jehovah the sons of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of Jehovah they encamped. As long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped.
\[19]And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the sons of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah, and did not journey.
\[20]And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle, then according to the commandment of Jehovah they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed.
\[21]And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning, and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed, or if by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.

\[10]Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings. And they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am Jehovah your God.
\[11]And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony.
\[12]And the sons of Israel set forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai, and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran.
\[13]And they first took their journey according to the commandment of Jehovah by Moses.
\[14]And in the first place the standard of the camp of the sons of Judah set forward according to their armies, and over his army was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
\[15]And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.
\[16]And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.
\[17]And the tabernacle was taken down, and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bore the tabernacle, set forward.
\[18]And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies, and over his army was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
\[19]And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
\[20]And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
\[21]And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary, and the others set up the tabernacle until their coming.
\[22]And the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim set forward according to their armies, and over his army was Elishama the son of Ammihud.
\[23]And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
\[24]And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.
\[25]And the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan, which was the rearward of all the camps, set forward according to their armies, and over his army was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
\[26]And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran.
\[27]And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
\[28]Thus were the journeys of the sons of Israel according to their armies, and they set forward.
\[29]And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, We are journeying to the place of which Jehovah said, I will give it to you. Come thou with us, and we will do thee good, for Jehovah has spoken good concerning Israel.
\[30]And he said to him, I will not go, but I will depart to my own land, and to my kindred.
\[31]And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee, inasmuch as thou know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou shall be to us instead of eyes.
\[32]And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that whatever good Jehovah shall do to us, the same we will do to thee.
\[33]And they set forward from the mount of Jehovah three days' journey. And the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting-place for them.
\[34]And the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day when they set forward from the camp.
\[35]And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, O Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered, and let those who hate thee flee before thee.
\[36]And when it rested, he said, Return, O Jehovah, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.

nd the people were as murmurers, speaking evil in the ears of Jehovah. And when Jehovah heard it, his anger was kindled, and the fire of Jehovah burnt among them, and devoured in the outermost part of the camp.
\[2]And the people cried to Moses. And Moses prayed to Jehovah, and the fire abated.
\[3]And the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah burnt among them.
\[4]And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly. And the sons of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?
\[5]We remember the fish which we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic,
\[6]but now our soul is dried away. There is nothing at all except this manna to look upon.
\[7]And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance of it as the appearance of bdellium.
\[8]The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it. And the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
\[9]And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.
\[10]And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent. And the anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly, and Moses was displeased.
\[11]And Moses said to Jehovah, Why have thou dealt ill with thy servant? And why have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou lay the burden of all this people upon me?
\[12]Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them forth, that thou should say to me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nurturing father carries the sucking child, to the land which thou swore to their fathers?
\[13]From where should I have flesh to give to all this people? For they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.
\[14]I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.
\[15]And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight, and let me not see my wretchedness.
\[16]And Jehovah said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou know to be the elders of the people and officers over them. And bring them to the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee.
\[17]And I will come down and talk with thee there. And I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou not bear it thyself alone.
\[18]And say thou to the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and ye shall eat flesh, for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt. Therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.
\[19]Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,
\[20]but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome to you, because ye have rejected Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why did we come forth out of Egypt?
\[21]And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen, and thou have said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.
\[22]Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?
\[23]And Jehovah said to Moses, Is Jehovah's hand grown short? Now thou shall see whether my word shall come to pass to thee or not.
\[24]And Moses went out, and told the people the words of Jehovah. And he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tent.
\[25]And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders. And it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.
\[26]But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. And the spirit rested upon them. And they were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the tent. And they prophesied in the camp.
\[27]And a young man ran, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.
\[28]And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.
\[29]And Moses said to him, Are thou jealous for my sake? Would that all of Jehovah's people were prophets, that Jehovah would put his spirit upon them!
\[30]And Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
\[31]And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth.
\[32]And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
\[33]While the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.
\[34]And the name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.
\[35]From Kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and they abode at Hazeroth.

nd Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman.
\[2]And they said, Has Jehovah indeed spoken only with Moses? Has he not spoken also with us? And Jehovah heard it.
\[3]Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men who were upon the face of the earth.
\[4]And Jehovah spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, Come out ye three to the tent of meeting. And the three came out.
\[5]And Jehovah came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the tent, and called Aaron and Miriam. And they both came forth.
\[6]And he said, Hear now my words. If there be a prophet among you, I Jehovah will make myself known to him in a vision. I will speak with him in a dream.
\[7]My servant Moses is not so. He is faithful in all my house.
\[8]With him I will speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches, and he has beheld the form of Jehovah. Why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?
\[9]And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against them, and he departed.
\[10]And the cloud removed from over the tent. And, behold, Miriam was leprous, as snow. And Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.
\[11]And Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, lay not, I pray thee, sin upon us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.
\[12]Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.
\[13]And Moses cried to Jehovah, saying, Heal her, O God, I beseech thee.
\[14]And Jehovah said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut up outside the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.
\[15]And Miriam was shut up outside the camp seven days. And the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.

nd Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[2]Send thou men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give to the sons of Israel. From every tribe of their fathers ye shall send a man, each one a ruler among them.
\[3]And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Jehovah. All of them men who were heads of the sons of Israel.
\[4]And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;
\[5]of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;
\[6]of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
\[7]of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;
\[8]of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;
\[9]of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;
\[10]of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;
\[11]of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi;
\[12]of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;
\[13]of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;
\[14]of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;
\[15]of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
\[16]These are the names of the men that Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.
\[17]And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, Get you up this way by the South, and go up into the hill-country.
\[18]And see the land, what it is, and the people who dwell in it, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many,
\[19]and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad, and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds,
\[20]and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood in it, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.
\[21]So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.
\[22]And they went up by the South, and came to Hebron. And Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the sons of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
\[23]And they came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it upon a staff between two, also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
\[24]That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut down from there.
\[25]And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.
\[26]And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh, and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
\[27]And they told him, and said, We came to the land where thou sent us. And surely it flows with milk and honey, and this is the fruit of it.
\[28]However the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified, very great, and moreover we saw the sons of Anak there.
\[29]Amalek dwells in the land of the South. And the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill-country. And the Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan.
\[30]And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it, for we are well able to overcome it.
\[31]But the men who went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.
\[32]And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the sons of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up the inhabitants of it. And all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature.
\[33]And we saw there the giants, the sons of Anak, who come of the giants. And we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.

nd all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried, and the people wept that night.
\[2]And all the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron. And the whole congregation said to them, Would that we had died in the land of Egypt, or would that we had died in this wilderness!
\[3]And why does Jehovah bring us to this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be a prey. Were it not better for us to return into Egypt?
\[4]And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
\[5]Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel.
\[6]And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes.
\[7]And they spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land.
\[8]If Jehovah delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us, a land which flows with milk and honey.
\[9]Only do not rebel against Jehovah, neither fear ye the people of the land, for they are bread for us. Their defense is removed from over them, and Jehovah is with us. Fear them not.
\[10]But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of meeting to all the sons of Israel.
\[11]And Jehovah said to Moses, How long will this people despise me? And how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have wrought among them?
\[12]I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they.
\[13]And Moses said to Jehovah, Then the Egyptians will hear it, for thou brought up this people in thy might from among them,
\[14]and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that thou Jehovah are in the midst of this people, for thou Jehovah are seen face to face, and thy cloud stands over them, and thou go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.
\[15]Now if thou shall kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,
\[16]Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.
\[17]And now, I pray thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as thou have spoken, saying,
\[18]Jehovah is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.
\[19]Pardon, I pray thee, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy loving kindness, and according as thou have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.
\[20]And Jehovah said, I have pardoned according to thy word,
\[21]but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah,
\[22]because all those men who have seen my glory, and my signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have challenged me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice,
\[23]surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of them who despised me see it.
\[24]But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land into which he went, and his seed shall possess it.
\[25]Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley. Tomorrow turn ye, and get you into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.
\[26]And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
\[27]How long shall I bear with this evil congregation that murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they murmur against me.
\[28]Say to them, As I live, says Jehovah, surely as ye have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you.
\[29]Your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness. And all who were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me,
\[30]surely ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell in it, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
\[31]But your little ones, that ye said would be a prey, them I will bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have rejected.
\[32]But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.
\[33]And your sons shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms, until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness.
\[34]After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, ye shall bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my alienation.
\[35]I, Jehovah, have spoken, surely I will do this to all this evil congregation that are gathered together against me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.
\[36]And the men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up an evil report against the land,
\[37]even those men who brought up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Jehovah.
\[38]But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land.
\[39]And Moses told these words to all the sons of Israel, and the people mourned greatly.
\[40]And they rose up early in the morning, and got up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and will go up to the place which Jehovah has promised, for we have sinned.
\[41]And Moses said, Why do ye now transgress the commandment of Jehovah, seeing it shall not prosper?
\[42]Do not go up, for Jehovah is not among you, that ye be not smitten down before your enemies.
\[43]For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword. Because ye have turned back from following Jehovah, therefore Jehovah will not be with you.
\[44]But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain, nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and Moses, did not depart out of the camp.
\[45]Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites who dwelt in that mountain, and smote them and beat them down, even to Hormah.

\[4]then he who offers his oblation shall offer to Jehovah a meal offering of a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil.
\[5]And wine for the drink offering, the fourth part of a hin, thou shall prepare with the burnt offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.
\[6]Or for a ram, thou shall prepare for a meal offering two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil.
\[7]And for the drink offering thou shall offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a sweet savor to Jehovah.
\[8]And when thou prepare a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings to Jehovah;
\[9]then he shall offer with the bullock a meal offering of three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil.
\[10]And thou shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Jehovah.

\[14]And if a stranger sojourns with you, or whoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Jehovah; as ye do, so he shall do.
\[15]For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you, and for the stranger who sojourns with you, a statute forever throughout your generations. As ye are, so shall the sojourner be before Jehovah.
\[16]One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger who sojourns with you.
\[17]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[18]Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When ye come into the land where I bring you,
\[19]then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up a heave offering to Jehovah.
\[20]Of the first of your dough ye shall offer up a cake for a heave offering, as the heave offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it.
\[21]Of the first of your dough ye shall give to Jehovah a heave offering throughout your generations.
\[22]And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which Jehovah has spoken to Moses,
\[23]even all that Jehovah has commanded you by Moses, from the day that Jehovah gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations,
\[24]then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savor to Jehovah, with the meal offering of it, and the drink offering of it, according to the ordinance, and one he-goat for a sin offering.
\[25]And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and they shall be forgiven, for it was an error, and they have brought their oblation, an offering made by fire to Jehovah, and their sin offering before Jehovah, for their error.
\[26]And all the congregation of the sons of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger who sojourns among them, for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly.
\[27]And if one soul sins unwittingly, then he shall offer a she-goat a year old for a sin offering.
\[28]And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that errs, when he sins unwittingly, before Jehovah, to make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.
\[29]Ye shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly, for him who is home-born among the sons of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among them.
\[30]But the soul that does anything with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, the same blasphemes Jehovah, and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
\[31]Because he has despised the word of Jehovah, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.

\[33]And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.

\[4]And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face.
\[5]And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, In the morning Jehovah will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to him, even him whom he shall choose will he cause to come near to him.

\[14]Moreover thou have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will thou put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up.

\[17]And take ye every man his censer, and put incense upon them, and bring ye before Jehovah every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers, thou also, and Aaron, each his censer.
\[18]And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.
\[19]And Korah assembled all the congregation against them to the door of the tent of meeting. And the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the congregation.
\[20]And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
\[21]Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
\[22]And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will thou be angry with all the congregation?
\[23]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[24]Speak to the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
\[25]And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.
\[26]And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.
\[27]So they got up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. And Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.
\[28]And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these works, for it is not of my own mind.
\[29]If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men, then Jehovah has not sent me.
\[30]But if Jehovah makes a new thing, and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows them up, with all that pertains to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then ye shall understand that these men have despised Jehovah.
\[31]And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground split asunder that was under them,
\[32]and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that pertained to Korah, and all their goods.
\[33]So they, and all that pertained to them, went down alive into Sheol. And the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly.
\[34]And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them, for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.
\[35]And fire came forth from Jehovah, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men who offered the incense.
\[36]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[37]Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder, for they are holy,
\[38]even the censers of these sinners against their own lives, and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar, for they offered them before Jehovah, therefore they are holy, and they shall be a sign to the sons of Israel.
\[39]And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, which those who were burnt had offered, and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,
\[40]to be a memorial to the sons of Israel, to the end that no stranger, who is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to burn incense before Jehovah, that he not be as Korah, and as his company, as Jehovah spoke to him by Moses.
\[41]But on the morrow all the congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of Jehovah.
\[42]And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting, and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared.
\[43]And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.
\[44]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[45]Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.
\[46]And Moses said to Aaron, Take thy censer, and put fire in it from off the altar, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them, for there is wrath gone out from Jehovah. The plague has begun.
\[47]And Aaron took as Moses spoke, and ran into the midst of the assembly. And, behold, the plague had begun among the people. And he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.
\[48]And he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stopped.
\[49]Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those who died about the matter of Korah.
\[50]And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tent of meeting, and the plague was stopped.

\[3]And thou shall write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi, for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers' houses.
\[4]And thou shall lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.
\[5]And it shall come to pass, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud. And I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they murmur against you.
\[6]And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel. And all their rulers gave him rods, for each ruler one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods, and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.
\[7]And Moses laid up the rods before Jehovah in the tent of the testimony.
\[8]And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony, and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.
\[9]And Moses brought out all the rods from before Jehovah to all the sons of Israel. And they looked, and took every man his rod.
\[10]And Jehovah said to Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a sign against the sons of rebellion, that thou may make an end of their murmurings against me, that they not die.
\[11]Thus Moses did. As Jehovah commanded him, so he did.
\[12]And the sons of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone.
\[13]Every man who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of Jehovah, dies. Shall we all of us perish?

\[2]And thy brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined to thee, and minister to thee, but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony.
\[3]And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tent. Only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar, that they not die, neither they, nor ye.
\[4]And they shall be joined to thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent, and a stranger shall not come near to you.
\[5]And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar, that there be no more wrath upon the sons of Israel.
\[6]And I, behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the sons of Israel. They are a gift to you, given to Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting.
\[7]And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil, and ye shall serve. I give you the priesthood as a service of gift. And the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.
\[8]And Jehovah spoke to Aaron, And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of my heave offerings, even all the hallowed things of the sons of Israel. I have given them to thee by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, as a portion forever.
\[9]This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.
\[10]As the most holy things thou shall eat of it; every male shall eat of it. It shall be holy to thee.
\[11]And this is thine: the heave offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the sons of Israel. I have given them to thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a portion forever. Everyone who is clean in thy house shall eat of it.
\[12]All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first-fruits of them which they give to Jehovah, I have given them to thee.
\[13]The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to Jehovah, shall be thine. Everyone who is clean in thy house shall eat of it.
\[14]Everything devoted in Israel shall be thine.
\[15]Everything that opens the womb, of all flesh which they offer to Jehovah, both of man and beast shall be thine. Nevertheless the firstborn of man thou shall surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts thou shall redeem.
\[16]And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shall thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs).
\[17]But the firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shall not redeem. They are holy. Thou shall sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor to Jehovah.
\[18]And the flesh of them shall be thine. As the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine.
\[19]All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the sons of Israel offer to Jehovah, I have given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a portion forever. It is a covenant of salt forever before Jehovah to thee and to thy seed with thee.
\[20]And Jehovah said to Aaron, Thou shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall thou have any portion among them. I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the sons of Israel.
\[21]And to the sons of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.
\[22]And henceforth the sons of Israel shall not come near the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.
\[23]But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations. And among the sons of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
\[24]For the tithe of the sons of Israel, which they offer as a heave offering to Jehovah, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance. Therefore I have said to them, Among the sons of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
\[25]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[26]Moreover thou shall speak to the Levites, and say to them, When ye take from the sons of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave offering of it for Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe.
\[27]And your heave offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it were the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the fullness of the winepress.
\[28]Thus ye also shall offer a heave offering to Jehovah of all your tithes, which ye receive of the sons of Israel. And from it ye shall give Jehovah's heave offering to Aaron the priest.
\[29]Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of Jehovah, of all the best of it, even the hallowed part of it out of it.
\[30]Therefore thou shall say to them, When ye heave the best of it from it, then it shall be reckoned to the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press.
\[31]And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households, for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting.

\[6]And the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

\[9]And a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up outside the camp in a clean place. And it shall be kept for the congregation of the sons of Israel for a water for impurity. It is a sin offering.
\[10]And he who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. And it shall be to the sons of Israel, and to the stranger who sojourns among them, for a statute forever.

\[14]This is the law when a man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.

\[3]And the people strove with Moses, and spoke, saying, Would that we had died when our brothers died before Jehovah!
\[4]And why have ye brought the assembly of Jehovah into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our beasts?
\[5]And why have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates, neither is there any water to drink.
\[6]And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tent of meeting, and fell upon their faces. And the glory of Jehovah appeared to them.
\[7]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[8]Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye to the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water, and thou shall bring forth water to them out of the rock. So thou shall give the congregation and their cattle drink.
\[9]And Moses took the rod from before Jehovah, as he commanded him.
\[10]And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, ye rebels. Shall we bring forth water to you out of this rock?
\[11]And Moses lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice, and water came forth abundantly. And the congregation drank, and their cattle.
\[12]And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, Because ye did not believe in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.
\[13]These are the waters of Meribah, because the sons of Israel strove with Jehovah, and he was sanctified in them.
\[14]And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus says thy brother Israel, Thou know all the travail that has befallen us,
\[15]how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time. And the Egyptians dealt ill with us and our fathers.
\[16]And when we cried to Jehovah, he heard our voice, and sent an agent, and brought us forth out of Egypt. And, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the outermost of thy border.
\[17]Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy land. We will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells. We will go along the king's highway. We will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border.
\[18]And Edom said to him, Thou shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against thee.
\[19]And the sons of Israel said to him, We will go up by the highway. And if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then will I give the price of it. Only let me, without doing anything, pass through on my feet.
\[20]And he said, Thou shall not pass through. And Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand.
\[21]Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border. Therefore Israel turned away from him.
\[22]And they journeyed from Kadesh, and the sons of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to mount Hor.

\[3]And Jehovah hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites. And they utterly destroyed them and their cities. And the name of the place was called Hormah.
\[4]And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to encompass the land of Edom. And the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
\[5]And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, and there is no water, and our soul loathes this light bread.
\[6]And Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, and many people of Israel died.
\[7]And the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, because we have spoken against Jehovah, and against thee. Pray to Jehovah, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
\[8]And Jehovah said to Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a standard. And it shall come to pass, that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.
\[9]And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon the standard. And it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked to the serpent of brass, he lived.

\[11]And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise.
\[12]From there they journeyed, and encamped in the valley of Zered.
\[13]From there they journeyed, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites, for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
\[14]Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Jehovah, Vaheb in Suphah, and the valleys of the Arnon,
\[15]and the slope of the valleys that inclines toward the dwelling of Ar, and leans upon the border of Moab.

\[18]the well, which the rulers dug, which the nobles of the people dug, with the scepter, and with their staves. And from the wilderness they journeyed to Mattanah,
\[19]and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
\[20]and from Bamoth to the valley which is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down upon the desert.
\[21]And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
\[22]Let me pass through thy land. We will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard. We will not drink of the water of the wells. We will go by the king's highway, until we have passed thy border.
\[23]And Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border, but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz, and he fought against Israel.
\[24]And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the sons of Ammon, for the border of the sons of Ammon was strong.
\[25]And Israel took all these cities. And Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns of it.
\[26]For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and had taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.
\[27]Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, Come ye to Heshbon. Let the city of Sihon be built and established.
\[28]For a fire has gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It has devoured Ar of Moab, the lords of the high places of the Arnon.
\[29]Woe to thee, Moab! Thou are undone, O people of Chemosh. He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites.
\[30]We have shot at them. Heshbon is perished even to Dibon, and we have laid waste even to Nophah, which reaches to Medeba.
\[31]Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
\[32]And Moses sent to spy out Jazer. And they took the towns of it, and drove out the Amorites that were there.
\[33]And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
\[34]And Jehovah said to Moses, Fear him not, for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land. And thou shall do to him as thou did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.

\[5]And he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, a people came out from Egypt. Behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide opposite me.
\[6]Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse for me this people, for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land. For I know that he whom thou bless is blessed, and he whom thou curse is cursed.

\[11]Behold, the people came out of Egypt, it covers the face of the earth. Now, come curse them for me. Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.
\[12]And God said to Balaam, Thou shall not go with them. Thou shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.
\[13]And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the rulers of Balak, Get into your land, for Jehovah refuses to give me leave to go with you.
\[14]And the rulers of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.
\[15]And Balak sent yet again rulers, more, and more honorable than they.

\[17]For I will promote thee to very great honor, and whatever thou say to me I will do. Come therefore, I pray thee, curse this people for me.
\[18]And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah my God, to do less or more.
\[19]Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what Jehovah will speak to me more.
\[20]And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, go with them, but only the word which I speak to thee, that shall thou do.
\[21]And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the rulers of Moab.
\[22]And God's anger was kindled because he went, and the agent of Jehovah placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his donkey, and his two servants were with him.
\[23]And the donkey saw the agent of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand, and the donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field. And Balaam smote the donkey, to turn her into the way.
\[24]Then the agent of Jehovah stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.
\[25]And the donkey saw the agent of Jehovah, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall. And he smote her again.
\[26]And the agent of Jehovah went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
\[27]And the donkey saw the agent of Jehovah, and she lay down under Balaam. And Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the donkey with his staff.
\[28]And Jehovah opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to thee, that thou have smitten me these three times?
\[29]And Balaam said to the donkey, Because thou have mocked me. I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed thee.
\[30]And the donkey said to Balaam, Am not I thy donkey, upon which thou have ridden all thy life long to this day? Was I ever accustomed to do so to thee? And he said, No.
\[31]Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the agent of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand. And he bowed his head, and fell on his face.
\[32]And the agent of Jehovah said to him, Why have thou smitten thy donkey these three times? Behold, I have come forth as an adversary, because thy way is perverse before me.

\[34]And Balaam said to the agent of Jehovah, I have sinned, for I knew not that thou stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get back again.
\[35]And the agent of Jehovah said to Balaam, Go with the men, but only the word that I shall speak to thee, that thou shall speak. So Balaam went with the rulers of Balak.
\[36]And when Balak heard that Balaam came, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the outmost part of the border.
\[37]And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to thee to call thee? Why did thou not come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor?
\[38]And Balaam said to Balak, Lo, I have come to thee. Have I now any power at all to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.
\[39]And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.
\[40]And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the rulers that were with him.

\[2]And Balak did as Balaam had spoken. And Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.
\[3]And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps Jehovah will come to meet me, and whatever he shows me I will tell thee. And he went to a bare height.
\[4]And God met Balaam, and he said to him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.
\[5]And Jehovah put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus thou shall speak.
\[6]And he returned to him. And, lo, he was standing by his burnt offering, he, and all the rulers of Moab.
\[7]And he took up his oracle, and said, From Aram Balak has brought me, the king of Moab from the mountains of the East. Come, curse Jacob for me, and come, defy Israel.
\[8]How shall I curse, whom God has not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom Jehovah has not defied?
\[9]For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him. Lo, it is a people that dwells alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
\[10]Who can count the dust of Jacob, or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!
\[11]And Balak said to Balaam, What have thou done to me? I took thee to curse my enemies, and, behold, thou have blessed them altogether.
\[12]And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which Jehovah puts in my mouth?
\[13]And Balak said to him, Come, I pray thee, with me to another place, from where thou may see them. Thou shall see but the outmost part of them, and shall not see them all, and curse them for me from there.
\[14]And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.
\[15]And he said to Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet Jehovah yonder.
\[16]And Jehovah met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus shall thou speak.
\[17]And he came to him. And, lo, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the rulers of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, What has Jehovah spoken?
\[18]And he took up his oracle, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear. Hearken to me, thou son of Zippor.
\[19]God is not a man, that he should lie, neither the son of man, that he should repent. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?
\[20]Behold, I have received to bless. And he has blessed, and I cannot reverse it.
\[21]He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither has he seen perverseness in Israel. Jehovah his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.
\[22]God brings them forth out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of the wild-ox.
\[23]Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob, neither is there any divination with Israel. Now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God wrought!
\[24]Behold, the people rise up as a lioness, and as a lion he lifts himself up. He shall not lie down until he eats of the prey, and drinks the blood of the slain.
\[25]And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
\[26]But Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not tell thee, saying, All that Jehovah speaks, that I must do?
\[27]And Balak said to Balaam, Come now, I will take thee to another place. Perhaps it will please God that thou may curse them for me from there.
\[28]And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down upon the desert.
\[29]And Balaam said to Balak, Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
\[30]And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.

\[2]And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes, and the Spirit of God came upon him.
\[3]And he took up his oracle, and said, Balaam the son of Beor says, and the man whose eye was closed says,
\[4]he says who hears the words of God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, and having his eyes open,
\[5]How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, thy tabernacles, O Israel!
\[6]As valleys they are spread forth, as gardens by the river-side, as aloes which Jehovah has planted, as cedar trees beside the waters.
\[7]Water shall flow from his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
\[8]God brings him forth out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of the wild-ox. He shall eat up the nations his adversaries, and shall break their bones in pieces, and smite them through with his arrows.
\[9]He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a lioness. Who shall rouse him up? He who blesses thee is blessed, And he who curses thee is cursed.
\[10]And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. And Balak said to Balaam, I called thee to curse my enemies, and, behold, thou have altogether blessed them these three times.
\[11]Therefore now flee thou to thy place. I thought to promote thee to great honor, but, lo, Jehovah has kept thee back from honor.
\[12]And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not also speak to thy messengers that thou sent to me, saying,
\[13]If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah, to do either good or bad of my own mind. What Jehovah speaks, that I will speak?
\[14]And now, behold, I go to my people. Come, I will advise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.
\[15]And he took up his oracle, and said, Balaam the son of Beor says, and the man whose eye was closed says,
\[16]he says who hears the words of God, and knows the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, and having his eyes open:
\[17]I see him, but not now. I behold him, but not near. There shall come forth a star out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite through the corners of Moab, and break down all the sons of tumult.
\[18]And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession, who were his enemies, while Israel does valiantly.
\[19]And out of Jacob shall come he who shall have dominion, and shall destroy the remnant from the city.
\[20]And he looked on Amalek, and took up his oracle, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations, but his latter end shall come to destruction.
\[21]And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his oracle, and said, Strong is thy dwelling-place, and thy nest is set in the rock.
\[22]Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.
\[23]And he took up his oracle, and said, Alas, who shall live when God does this?
\[24]But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim, and they shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall come to destruction.

\[12]Therefore say, Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace.
\[13]And it shall be to him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the sons of Israel.

\[15]And the name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur. He was head of the people of a fathers' house in Midian.
\[16]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[17]Vex the Midianites, and smite them,
\[18]for they vex you with their wiles, with which they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the ruler of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.

\[19]and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation, and give him a charge in their sight.
\[20]And thou shall put of thine honor upon him, that all the congregation of the sons of Israel may obey.

nd Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the sons of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded.
\[2]When a man vows a vow to Jehovah, or swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word. He shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
\[3]Also when a woman vows a vow to Jehovah, and binds herself by a bond, being in her father's house, in her youth,
\[4]and her father hears her vow, and her bond with which she has bound her soul, and her father remains silent at her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand.
\[5]But if her father disallows her in the day that he hears, none of her vows, or of her bonds with which she has bound her soul, shall stand. And Jehovah will forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
\[6]And if she is married to a husband, while her vows are upon her, or the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul,
\[7]and her husband hears it, and remains silent at her in the day that he hears it, then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she has bound her soul shall stand.
\[8]But if her husband disallows her in the day that he hears it, then he shall make void her vow which is upon her, and the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul. And Jehovah will forgive her.
\[9]But the vow of a widow, or of her who is divorced, even everything with which she has bound her soul shall stand against her.
\[10]And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,
\[11]and her husband heard it, and remained silent at her, and did not disallow her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand.
\[12]But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand. Her husband has made them void, and Jehovah will forgive her.
\[13]Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
\[14]But if her husband altogether remains silent at her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her. He has established them, because he remained silent at her in the day that he heard them.
\[15]But if he shall make them null and void after he has heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.
\[16]These are the statutes, which Jehovah commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth in her father's house.

nd Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[2]Avenge the sons of Israel of the Midianites. Afterward thou shall be gathered to thy people.
\[3]And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm ye men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute Jehovah's vengeance on Midian.
\[4]From every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, ye shall send to the war.
\[5]So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
\[6]And Moses sent them, a thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.
\[7]And they warred against Midian as Jehovah commanded Moses, and they killed every male.
\[8]And they killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.
\[9]And the sons of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones. And all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey.
\[10]And all their cities in the places in which they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire.
\[11]And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of beast.
\[12]And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho.
\[13]And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the rulers of the congregation, went forth to meet them outside the camp.
\[14]And Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war.
\[15]And Moses said to them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
\[16]Behold, these caused the sons of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against Jehovah in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of Jehovah.
\[17]Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that has known man by lying with him.
\[18]But all the women-children, who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
\[19]And encamp ye outside the camp seven days. Whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, ye and your captives.
\[20]And as to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood, ye shall purify yourselves.
\[21]And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah has commanded Moses:
\[22]only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead-
\[23]everything which may go into fire-ye shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean. Nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity. And all that may not go into fire ye shall make to go through the water.
\[24]And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.
\[25]And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\[26]Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers of the congregation,
\[27]and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war who went out to battle, and all the congregation.
\[28]And levy a tribute to Jehovah of the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the oxen, and of the donkeys, and of the flocks.
\[29]Take it of their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for Jehovah's heave offering.
\[30]And of the sons of Israel's half, thou shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, even of all the cattle, and give them to the Levites, who keep the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.
\[31]And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Jehovah commanded Moses.
\[32]Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,
\[33]and seventy-two thousand oxen,
\[34]and sixty-one thousand donkeys,
\[35]and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the women who had not known man by lying with him.
\[36]And the half, which was the portion of those who went out to war, was in number three hundred thirty-seven thousand and five hundred sheep.
\[37]And Jehovah's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five.
\[38]And the oxen were thirty-six thousand, of which Jehovah's tribute was seventy-two.
\[39]And the donkeys were thirty thousand and five hundred, of which Jehovah's tribute was sixty-one.
\[40]And the persons were sixteen thousand, of whom Jehovah's tribute was thirty-two persons.
\[41]And Moses gave the tribute, which was Jehovah's heave offering, to Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
\[42]And of the sons of Israel's half, which Moses divided off from the men who warred
\[43](now the congregation's half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
\[44]and thirty-six thousand oxen,
\[45]and thirty thousand and five hundred donkeys,
\[46]and sixteen thousand persons),
\[47]even of the sons of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them to the Levites, who kept the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
\[48]And the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near to Moses.
\[49]And they said to Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war that are under our charge, and there lacks not one man of us.
\[50]And we have brought Jehovah's oblation, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, ankle-chains, and bracelets, signet-rings, earrings, and armlets, to make atonement for our souls before Jehovah.
\[51]And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, even all wrought jewels.
\[52]And all the gold of the heave offering that they offered up to Jehovah, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
\[53](For the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)
\[54]And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, for a memorial for the sons of Israel before Jehovah.

ow the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle. And when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle,
\[2]the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the rulers of the congregation, saying,
\[3]Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
\[4]the land which Jehovah smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle.
\[5]And they said, If we have found favor in thy sight, let this land be given to thy servants for a possession. Bring us not over the Jordan.
\[6]And Moses said to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to the war, and shall ye sit here?
\[7]And why do ye discourage the heart of the sons of Israel from going over into the land which Jehovah has given them?
\[8]Thus did your fathers when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
\[9]For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the sons of Israel, that they should not go into the land which Jehovah had given them.
\[10]And Jehovah's anger was kindled in that day, and he swore, saying,
\[11]Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me,
\[12]except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun, because they have wholly followed Jehovah.
\[13]And Jehovah's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of Jehovah was consumed.
\[14]And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of Jehovah toward Israel.
\[15]For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness, and ye will destroy all this people.
\[16]And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones,
\[17]but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the sons of Israel, until we have brought them to their place. And our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
\[18]We will not return to our houses until the sons of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.
\[19]For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward, because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.
\[20]And Moses said to them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will arm yourselves to go before Jehovah to the war,
\[21]and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Jehovah, until he has driven out his enemies from before him,
\[22]and the land is subdued before Jehovah, then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless towards Jehovah, and towards Israel, and this land shall be to you for a possession before Jehovah.
\[23]But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against Jehovah, and be sure your sin will find you out.
\[24]Build for you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep, and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.
\[25]And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commands.
\[26]Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead,
\[27]but thy servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before Jehovah to battle, as my lord says.
\[28]So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel.
\[29]And Moses said to them, If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man that is armed to battle, before Jehovah, and the land shall be subdued before you, then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession,
\[30]but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
\[31]And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying, As Jehovah has said to thy servants, so we will do.
\[32]We will pass over armed before Jehovah into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance is with us beyond the Jordan.
\[33]And Moses gave to them, even to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to the cities of it with their borders, even the cities of the land round about.
\[34]And the sons of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
\[35]and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,
\[36]and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep.
\[37]And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,
\[38]and Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Sibmah. And they gave other names to the cities which they built.
\[39]And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites that were in it.
\[40]And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he dwelt in it.
\[41]And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the towns of it, and called them Havvoth-jair.
\[42]And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages of it, and called it Nobah, after his own name.

\[53]And ye shall take possession of the land, and dwell in it, for to you I have given the land to possess it.
\[54]And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families. To the more ye shall give more inheritance, and to the few thou shall give less inheritance. Wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his. Ye shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers.
\[55]But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those that ye let remain of them shall be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides, and they shall vex you in the land in which ye dwell.
\[56]And it shall come to pass, that, as I thought to do to them, so I will do to you.

\[17]And if he smote him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death.
\[18]Or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death.
\[19]The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death. When he meets him, he shall put him to death.
\[20]And if he thrust him from hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,
\[21]or in enmity smote him with his hand, so that he died, he who smote him shall surely be put to death. He is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meets him.
\[22]But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled upon him anything without lying in wait,
\[23]or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, nor sought his harm,
\[24]then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances.
\[25]And the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge where he fled. And he shall dwell in it until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
\[26]But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge where he flees,
\[27]and the avenger of blood find him outside the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kills the manslayer, he shall not be guilty of blood,
\[28]because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession.
\[29]And these things shall be for a statute and ordinance to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
\[30]Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses, but one witness shall not testify against any person so that he dies.
\[31]Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to death.
\[32]And ye shall take no ransom for him who has fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
\[33]So ye shall not pollute the land in which ye are, for blood, it pollutes the land. And no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, but by the blood of him who shed it.
\[34]And thou shall not defile the land which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell, for I, Jehovah, dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel.

nd the heads of the fathers of the family of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the rulers, the heads of the fathers of the sons of Israel.
\[2]And they said, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the sons of Israel. And my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
\[3]And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the sons of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong. So it will be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.
\[4]And when the jubilee of the sons of Israel shall be, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong. So their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
\[5]And Moses commanded the sons of Israel according to the word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speak right.
\[6]This is the thing which Jehovah commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best, only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married.
\[7]So no inheritance of the sons of Israel shall remove from tribe to tribe, for the sons of Israel shall cling each one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
\[8]And every daughter, who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the sons of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the sons of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.
\[9]So no inheritance shall move from one tribe to another tribe, for the tribes of the sons of Israel shall cling each one to his own inheritance.
\[10]Even as Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad,
\[11]for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophedad, were married to their father's brothers' sons.
\[12]They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
\[13]These are the commandments and the ordinances which Jehovah commanded by Moses to the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.

hese are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab.
\[2]It is eleven days journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.
\[3]And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, according to all that Jehovah had given him in commandment to them,
\[4]after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.
\[5]Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying,
\[6]Jehovah our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough at this mountain.
\[7]Turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites, and to all the places near thereto, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the sea-shore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
\[8]Behold, I have set the land before you. Go in and possess the land which Jehovah swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.
\[9]And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone.
\[10]Jehovah your God has multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
\[11]Jehovah, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as ye are, and bless you, as he has promised you!
\[12]How can I myself alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
\[13]Take for you wise men, and understanding, and known, according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.
\[14]And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou have spoken is good to do.
\[15]So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.
\[16]And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the sojourner who is with him.
\[17]Ye shall not respect persons in judgment. Ye shall hear the small and the great alike. Ye shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God's. And the case that is too hard for you ye shall bring to me, and I will hear it.
\[18]And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
\[19]And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God commanded us, and we came to Kadesh-barnea.
\[20]And I said to you, Ye have come to the hill-country of the Amorites, which Jehovah our God gives to us.
\[21]Behold, Jehovah thy God has set the land before thee. Go up, take possession, as Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, has spoken to thee. Fear not, neither be dismayed.
\[22]And ye came near to me, all of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.
\[23]And the thing pleased me well. And I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe.
\[24]And they turned and went up into the hill-country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
\[25]And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which Jehovah our God gives to us.
\[26]Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God.
\[27]And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because Jehovah hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
\[28]Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to heaven, and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.
\[29]Then I said to you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
\[30]Jehovah your God who goes before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
\[31]and in the wilderness, where thou have seen how that Jehovah thy God bore thee, as a man bears his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came to this place.
\[32]Yet in this thing ye did not believe Jehovah your God,
\[33]who went before you in the way, to seek out a place for you to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day.
\[34]And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,
\[35]Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,
\[36]except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it, and I will give to him the land that he has trodden upon, and to his sons, because he has wholly followed Jehovah.
\[37]Also Jehovah was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shall not go in there.
\[38]Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before thee, he shall go in there. Encourage thou him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
\[39]Moreover your little ones, who ye said would be a prey, and your sons, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there, and I will give it to them, and they shall possess it.
\[40]But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.
\[41]Then ye answered and said to me, We have sinned against Jehovah, we will go up and fight according to all that Jehovah our God commanded us. And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill-country.
\[42]And Jehovah said to me, Say to them, Do not go up, neither fight, for I am not among you, lest ye be smitten before your enemies.
\[43]So I spoke to you, and ye did not hearken, but ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country.
\[44]And the Amorites, who dwelt in that hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah.
\[45]And ye returned and wept before Jehovah, but Jehovah did not hearken to your voice, nor gave ear to you.
\[46]So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according to the days that ye abode there.

hen we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Jehovah spoke to me. And we encompassed mount Seir many days.
\[2]And Jehovah spoke to me, saying,
\[3]Ye have encompassed this mountain long enough, turn northward.
\[4]And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brothers the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir, and they will be afraid of you. Take ye good heed to yourselves therefore.
\[5]Do not contend with them, for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given mount Seir to Esau for a possession.
\[6]Ye shall purchase food from them for money, that ye may eat, and ye shall also buy water from them for money, that ye may drink.
\[7]For Jehovah thy God has blessed thee in all the work of thy hand. He has known thy walking through this great wilderness. These forty years Jehovah thy God has been with thee; thou have lacked nothing.
\[8]So we passed by from our brothers the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion-geber. And we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
\[9]And Jehovah said to me, Do not vex Moab, neither contend with them in battle, for I will not give thee of his land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot for a possession.
\[10](The Emim dwelt in it formerly, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim.
\[11]These also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim, but the Moabites call them Emim.
\[12]The Horites also dwelt in Seir formerly, but the sons of Esau succeeded them. And they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead, as Israel did to the land of his possession, which Jehovah gave to them.)
\[13]Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.
\[14]And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we came over the brook Zered, were thirty-eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah swore to them.
\[15]Moreover the hand of Jehovah was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.
\[16]So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
\[17]that Jehovah spoke to me, saying,
\[18]Thou are this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab.
\[19]And when thou come near opposite the sons of Ammon, do not vex them, nor contend with them, for I will not give thee of the land of the sons of Ammon for a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession.
\[20](That also is accounted a land of Rephaim. Rephaim dwelt in it formerly, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,
\[21]a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim. But Jehovah destroyed them before them, and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead,
\[22]as he did for the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them. And they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even to this day.
\[23]And the Avvim, who dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)
\[24]Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.
\[25]This day I will begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples who are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.
\[26]And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
\[27]Let me pass through thy land. I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.
\[28]Thou shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink. Only let me pass through on my feet,
\[29]as the sons of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me, until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which Jehovah our God gives us.
\[30]But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him, for Jehovah thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as at this day.
\[31]And Jehovah said to me, Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before thee. Begin to possess, that thou may inherit his land.
\[32]Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.
\[33]And Jehovah our God delivered him up before us. And we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.
\[34]And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining.
\[35]We only took the cattle for a prey to ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.
\[36]From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. Jehovah our God delivered up all before us.
\[37]Only to the land of the sons of Ammon thou did not come near, all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill-country, and wherever Jehovah our God forbad us.

hen we turned, and went up the way to Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
\[2]And Jehovah said to me, Fear him not, for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand. And thou shall do to him as thou did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.
\[3]So Jehovah our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people, and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.
\[4]And we took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we did not take from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\[5]All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the un-walled towns a great many.
\[6]And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.
\[7]But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.
\[8]And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to mount Hermon
\[9](the Sidonians call Hermon, Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir),
\[10]all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\[11](For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron. Is it not in Rabbah of the sons of Ammon? Nine cubits was the length of it, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.)
\[12]And we took this land in possession at that time. From Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead, and the cities of it, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
\[13]And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. The same is called the land of Rephaim.
\[14](Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, to this day.)
\[15]And I gave Gilead to Machir.
\[16]And I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and the border of it, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the sons of Ammon,
\[17]also the Arabah, and the Jordan and the border of it, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.
\[18]And I commanded you at that time, saying, Jehovah your God has given you this land to possess it. Ye shall pass over armed before your brothers the sons of Israel, all the men of valor.
\[19]But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you
\[20]until Jehovah gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which Jehovah your God gives them beyond the Jordan, then ye shall return every man to his possession, which I have given you.
\[21]And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that Jehovah your God has done to these two kings. So shall Jehovah do to all the kingdoms where thou go over.
\[22]Ye shall not fear them, for Jehovah your God, he it is who fights for you.
\[23]And I besought Jehovah at that time, saying,
\[24]O lord Jehovah, thou have begun to show thy servant thy greatness, and thy strong hand, for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy mighty acts?
\[25]Let me go over, I pray thee, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
\[26]But Jehovah was angry with me because of you, and did not hearken to me. And Jehovah said to me, It shall be enough for thee. Speak no more to me of this matter.
\[27]Get thee up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thine eyes, for thou shall not go over this Jordan.
\[28]But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him, for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shall see.

nd now, O Israel, hearken to the statutes and to the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah, the God of your fathers, gives you.
\[2]Ye shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish from it, that ye may keep the commandments of Jehovah your God which I command you.
\[3]Your eyes have seen what Jehovah did because of Baal-peor. For all the men who followed Baal-peor, Jehovah thy God has destroyed them from the midst of thee.
\[4]But ye who clung to Jehovah your God are alive every one of you this day.
\[5]Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Jehovah my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the midst of the land where ye go in to possess it.
\[6]Keep therefore and do them, for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
\[7]For what great nation is there that has a god so near to them, as Jehovah our God is whenever we call upon him?
\[8]And what great nation is there that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
\[9]Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes saw, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life, but make them known to thy sons and thy son's sons-
\[10]the day that thou stood before Jehovah thy God in Horeb, when Jehovah said to me, Assemble the people to me, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live upon the earth, and that they may teach their sons.
\[11]And ye came near and stood under the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.
\[12]And Jehovah spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. Ye heard the voice of words, but ye saw no form, only a voice.
\[13]And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments. And he wrote them upon two tablets of stone.
\[14]And Jehovah commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that ye might do them in the land where ye go over to possess it.
\[15]Take ye therefore good heed to yourselves, for ye saw no manner of form on the day that Jehovah spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire.
\[16]Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make for you a graven image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
\[17]the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky,
\[18]the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth.
\[19]And lest thou lift up thine eyes to heaven, and when thou see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, thou be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Jehovah thy God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven.
\[20]But Jehovah has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as at this day.
\[21]Furthermore Jehovah was angry with me because of you, and swore that I would not go over the Jordan, and that I would not go in to that good land, which Jehovah thy God gives thee for an inheritance,
\[22]but I must die in this land. I must not go over the Jordan, but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.
\[23]Take heed to yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of Jehovah your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image in the form of anything which Jehovah thy God has forbidden thee.
\[24]For Jehovah thy God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
\[25]When thou shall beget sons, and son's sons, and ye shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah thy God, to provoke him to anger,
\[26]I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land to which ye go over the Jordan to possess it. Ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall be utterly destroyed.
\[27]And Jehovah will scatter you among the peoples, and ye shall be left few in number among the nations where Jehovah shall lead you away.
\[28]And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
\[29]But from there ye shall seek Jehovah thy God. And thou shall find him when thou search after him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
\[30]When thou are in tribulation, and all these things have come upon thee, in the latter days thou shall return to Jehovah thy God, and hearken to his voice.
\[31]For Jehovah thy God is a merciful God. He will not fail thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he swore to them.
\[32]For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one end of heaven to the other, whether there has been anything as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?
\[33]Did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou have heard, and live?
\[34]Or has God assayed to go and take for him a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Jehovah your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
\[35]It was shown to thee, that thou might know that Jehovah he is God. There is none else besides him.
\[36]Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee. And upon earth he made thee to see his great fire, and thou heard his words out of the midst of the fire.
\[37]And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt,
\[38]to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as at this day.
\[39]Know therefore this day, and lay it to thy heart, that Jehovah he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath. There is none else.
\[40]And thou shall keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy sons after thee, and that thou may prolong thy days in the land, which Jehovah thy God gives thee, forever.
\[41]Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise,
\[42]that the manslayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unawares, and did not hate him in time past, and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live:
\[43]namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.
\[44]And this is the law which Moses set before the sons of Israel.
\[45]These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt,
\[46]beyond the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel smote when they came forth out of Egypt.
\[47]And they took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise,
\[48]from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even to mount Sion (the same is Hermon),

\[3]Jehovah did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.
\[4]Jehovah spoke with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire
\[5](I stood between Jehovah and you at that time, to show you the word of Jehovah, for ye were afraid because of the fire, and did not go up onto the mount), saying,
\[6]I am Jehovah thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
\[7]Thou shall have no other gods before me.
\[8]Thou shall not make to thee a graven image: any likeness that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
\[9]Thou shall not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them, for I, Jehovah thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, and upon the third and upon the fourth generation of those who hate me,
\[10]and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
\[11]Thou shall not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain, for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.
\[12]Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee.
\[13]Six days thou shall labor, and do all thy work,
\[14]but the seventh day is a sabbath to Jehovah thy God: thou shall not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thine ox, nor thy donkey, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates, that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou.
\[15]And thou shall remember that thou were a servant in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God brought thee out from there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm, therefore Jehovah thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.
\[16]Honor thy father and thy mother, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee, that thy days may be long, and that it may go well with thee in the land which Jehovah thy God gives thee.
\[17]Thou shall not murder.
\[18]Neither shall thou commit adultery.
\[19]Neither shall thou steal.
\[20]Neither shall thou bear false witness against thy neighbor.
\[21]Neither shall thou covet thy neighbor's wife. Neither shall thou desire thy neighbor's house, his field, or his man-servant, or his maid-servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is thy neighbor's.
\[22]These words Jehovah spoke to all your assembly on the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice, and he added no more. And he wrote them upon two tablets of stone, and gave them to me.
\[23]And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that ye came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders.
\[24]And ye said, Behold, Jehovah our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire. We have seen this day that God speaks with man, and he lives.
\[25]Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we hear the voice of Jehovah our God any more, then we shall die.
\[26]For who is there of all flesh, who has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
\[27]Go thou near, and hear all that Jehovah our God shall say. And speak thou to us all that Jehovah our God shall speak to thee, and we will hear it, and do it.
\[28]And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke to me. And Jehovah said to me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to thee. They have well said all that they have spoken.
\[29]Oh that there were such a heart in them that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their sons forever!
\[30]Go say to them, Return ye to your tents.
\[31]But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak to thee all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which thou shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.
\[32]Ye shall observe to do therefore as Jehovah your God has commanded you. Ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
\[33]Ye shall walk in all the way which Jehovah your God has commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.

\[11]and houses full of all good things, which thou did not fill, and cisterns hewn out, which thou did not hew, vineyards and olive trees, which thou did not plant, and thou shall eat and be full,
\[12]then beware lest thou forget Jehovah, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
\[13]Thou shall fear Jehovah thy God, and him thou shall serve, and shall swear by his name.
\[14]Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples that are round about you,
\[15]for Jehovah thy God in the midst of thee is a jealous God, lest the anger of Jehovah thy God be kindled against thee, and he destroy thee from off the face of the earth.
\[16]Ye shall not challenge Jehovah your God, as ye challenged him in Massah.
\[17]Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of Jehovah your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded thee.
\[18]And thou shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Jehovah, that it may be well with thee, and that thou may go in and possess the good land which Jehovah swore to thy fathers,
\[19]to thrust out all thine enemies from before thee, as Jehovah has spoken.
\[20]When thy son asks thee in time to come, saying, What is the meaning of the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Jehovah our God has commanded you?
\[21]Then thou shall say to thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt, and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
\[22]And Jehovah showed signs and wonders, great and grievous, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his house, before our eyes.
\[23]And he brought us out from there that he might bring us in to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.
\[24]And Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Jehovah our God for our good always, that he might preserve us alive as at this day.
\[25]And it shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all this commandment before Jehovah our God as he has commanded us.

\[2]and when Jehovah thy God shall deliver them up before thee, and thou shall smite them, then thou shall utterly destroy them. Thou shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them.
\[3]Neither shall thou make marriages with them. Thy daughter thou shall not give to his son, nor his daughter shall thou take to thy son.
\[4]For he will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods, so the anger of Jehovah will be kindled against you, and he will destroy thee quickly.
\[5]But thus shall ye deal with them: Ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire.
\[6]For thou are a holy people to Jehovah thy God. Jehovah thy God has chosen thee to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth.
\[7]Jehovah did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people, for ye were the fewest of all peoples,
\[8]but because Jehovah loves you. And because he would keep the oath which he swore to your fathers, Jehovah has brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
\[9]Know therefore that Jehovah thy God, he is God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations,
\[10]and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them. He will not be slack to him who hates him. He will repay him to his face.
\[11]Thou shall therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command thee this day, to do them.
\[12]And it shall come to pass, because ye hearken to these ordinances, and keep and do them, that Jehovah thy God will keep with thee the covenant and the loving kindness which he swore to thy fathers.
\[13]And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee. He will also bless the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground, thy grain and thy new wine and thine oil, the increase of thy cattle and the young of thy flock, in the land which he swore to thy fathers to give thee.
\[14]Thou shall be blessed above all peoples. There shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.
\[15]And Jehovah will take away from thee all sickness. And none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou know, will he put upon thee, but will lay them upon all those who hate thee.
\[16]And thou shall consume all the peoples that Jehovah thy God shall deliver to thee. Thine eye shall not pity them. Neither shall thou serve their gods, for that will be a snare to thee.
\[17]If thou shall say in thy heart, These nations are more than I. How can I dispossess them?
\[18]Thou shall not be afraid of them. Thou shall remember well what Jehovah thy God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt:
\[19]the great trials which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm by which Jehovah thy God brought thee out. So shall Jehovah thy God do to all the peoples of whom thou are afraid.
\[20]Moreover Jehovah thy God will send the hornet among them until those who are left and hide themselves perish from before thee.
\[21]Thou shall not be frightened at them, for Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a great God and awesome.
\[22]And Jehovah thy God will cast out those nations before thee little by little. Thou may not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.
\[23]But Jehovah thy God will deliver them up before thee, and will discomfit them with a great confusion until they be destroyed.
\[24]And he will deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shall make their name to perish from under heaven. There shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.
\[25]Ye shall burn the graven images of their gods with fire. Thou shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it to thee, lest thou be snared by it, for it is an abomination to Jehovah thy God.
\[26]And thou shall not bring an abomination into thy house, and become a devoted thing like it. Thou shall utterly detest it, and thou shall utterly abhor it, for it is a cursed thing.

\[2]And thou shall remember all the way which Jehovah thy God has led thee these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble thee, to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou would keep his commandments, or not.
\[3]And he humbled thee, and allowed thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knew not, neither did thy fathers know, that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of Jehovah.
\[4]Thy raiment did not grow old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.
\[5]And thou shall consider in thy heart, that, as a man chastens his son, so Jehovah thy God chastens thee.
\[6]And thou shall keep the commandments of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
\[7]For Jehovah thy God brings thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills;
\[8]a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey,
\[9]a land in which thou shall eat bread without scarceness. Thou shall not lack anything in it, a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou may dig copper.
\[10]And thou shall eat and be full, and thou shall bless Jehovah thy God for the good land which he has given thee.
\[11]Beware lest thou forget Jehovah thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command thee this day.
\[12]Lest, when thou have eaten and are full, and have built goodly houses, and dwelt in it,
\[13]and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou have is multiplied,
\[14]then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget Jehovah thy God, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage,
\[15]who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness-fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water-who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint,
\[16]who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers did not know, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end.
\[17]And lest thou say in thy heart, My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.
\[18]But thou shall remember Jehovah thy God, for it is he who gives thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to thy fathers, as at this day.
\[19]And it shall be, if thou shall forget Jehovah thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.

ear, O Israel: Thou are to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fortified up to heaven,
\[2]a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou know, and of whom thou have heard say, Who can stand before the sons of Anak?
\[3]Know therefore this day, that Jehovah thy God is he who goes over before thee as a devouring fire. He will destroy them, and he will bring them down before thee. So thou shall drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Jehovah has spoken to thee.
\[4]Do not speak thou in thy heart, after Jehovah thy God has thrust them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness Jehovah has brought me in to possess this land. Whereas for the wickedness of these nations Jehovah drives them out from before thee.
\[5]Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart, do thou go in to possess their land, but for the wickedness of these nations Jehovah thy God drives them out from before thee, and that he may establish the word which Jehovah swore to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
\[6]Know therefore, that Jehovah thy God does not give thee this good land to possess it for thy righteousness, for thou are a stiff-necked people.
\[7]Remember, do not thou forget how thou provoked Jehovah thy God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that thou went forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came to this place, ye have been rebellious against Jehovah.
\[8]Also in Horeb ye provoked Jehovah to wrath, and Jehovah was angry with you to destroy you.
\[9]When I was gone up onto the mount to receive the tablets of stone, even the tablets of the covenant which Jehovah made with you, then I abode on the mount forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water.
\[10]And Jehovah delivered to me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God. And on them was according to all the words, which Jehovah spoke with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
\[11]And it came to pass, at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Jehovah gave me the two tablets of stone, even the tablets of the covenant.
\[12]And Jehovah said to me, Arise, get thee down quickly from here, for thy people that thou have brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. They have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them. They have made them a molten image.
\[13]Furthermore Jehovah spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people.
\[14]Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven, and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.
\[15]So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount was burning with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.
\[16]And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against Jehovah your God. Ye had made you a molten calf. Ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which Jehovah had commanded you.
\[17]And I took hold of the two tablets, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.
\[18]And I fell down before Jehovah, as at the first, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
\[19]For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which Jehovah was angry against you to destroy you. But Jehovah hearkened to me that time also.
\[20]And Jehovah was very angry with Aaron to destroy him. And I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
\[21]And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. And I cast the dust of it into the brook that descended out of the mount.
\[22]And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked Jehovah to wrath.
\[23]And when Jehovah sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you, then ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God, and ye did not believe him, nor hearken to his voice.
\[24]Ye have been rebellious against Jehovah from the day that I knew you.
\[25]So I fell down before Jehovah the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Jehovah had said he would destroy you.
\[26]And I prayed to Jehovah, and said, O lord Jehovah, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, that thou have redeemed through thy greatness, that thou have brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
\[27]Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Look not to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their profaneness, nor to their sin,
\[28]lest the land from where thou brought us out say, Because Jehovah was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.
\[29]Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou brought out by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm.

\[2]And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which thou broke, and thou shall put them in the ark.
\[3]So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tablets of stone like the first, and went up onto the mount, having the two tablets in my hand.
\[4]And he wrote on the tablets according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Jehovah spoke to you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly, and Jehovah gave them to me.
\[5]And I turned and came down from the mount, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made. And they are there as Jehovah commanded me.
\[6](And the sons of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried, and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.
\[7]From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.
\[8]At that time Jehovah set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.
\[9]Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers. Jehovah is his inheritance, according as Jehovah thy God spoke to him.)
\[10]And I stayed on the mount as at the first time, forty days and forty nights, and Jehovah hearkened to me that time also: Jehovah would not destroy thee.
\[11]And Jehovah said to me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, and they shall go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them.
\[12]And now, Israel, what does Jehovah thy God require of thee, but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,
\[13]to keep the commandments of Jehovah, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?
\[14]Behold, to Jehovah thy God belongs heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is in it.
\[15]Only Jehovah had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples as at this day.
\[16]Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.
\[17]For Jehovah your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awesome, who regards not persons, nor takes reward.
\[18]He executes justice for the fatherless and widow, and loves the sojourner in giving him food and raiment.
\[19]Love ye therefore the sojourner, for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
\[20]Thou shall fear Jehovah thy God. Him thou shall serve, and to him thou shall cling, and by his name thou shall swear.
\[21]He is thy praise, and he is thy God, who has done for thee these great and awesome things, which thine eyes have seen.

\[3]and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land,
\[4]and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots, how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how Jehovah has destroyed them to this day,
\[5]and what he did to you in the wilderness, until ye came to this place,
\[6]and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben, how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel,

\[10]For the land, where thou go in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from where ye came out, where thou sowed thy seed, and watered it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs,
\[11]but the land, where ye go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinks water from the rain of heaven,
\[12]a land which Jehovah thy God cares for. The eyes of Jehovah thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.
\[13]And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love Jehovah your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,

\[16]Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them,
\[17]and the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and he shut up the heavens, so that there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield its fruit, and ye perish quickly from off the good land which Jehovah gives you.
\[18]Therefore ye shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul. And ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.
\[19]And ye shall teach them to your sons, talking of them when thou sit in thy house, and when thou walk by the way, and when thou lie down, and when thou rise up.
\[20]And thou shall write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates,
\[21]that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your sons, in the land which Jehovah swore to your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.
\[22]For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cling to him,
\[23]then will Jehovah drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.
\[24]Every place on which the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours, from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the hinder sea shall be your border.
\[25]There shall no man be able to stand before you. Jehovah your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he has spoken to you.
\[26]Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:
\[27]the blessing, if ye shall hearken to the commandments of Jehovah your God, which I command you this day,
\[28]and the curse, if ye shall not hearken to the commandments of Jehovah your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day to go after other gods, which ye have not known.

\[16]Only ye shall not eat the blood. Thou shall pour it out upon the ground as water.
\[17]Thou may not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy grain, or of thy new wine, or of thine oil, or the firstlings of thy herd or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vow, nor thy freewill offerings, nor the heave offering of thy hand.
\[18]But thou shall eat them before Jehovah thy God in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite who is within thy gates. And thou shall rejoice before Jehovah thy God in all that thou put thy hand to.
\[19]Take heed to thyself that thou not forsake the Levite as long as thou live in thy land.
\[20]When Jehovah thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he has promised thee, and thou shall say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul desires to eat flesh, thou may eat flesh, after all the desire of thy soul.

\[22]Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so thou shall eat of it. The unclean and the clean may eat of it alike.
\[23]Only be sure that thou not eat the blood. For the blood is the life, and thou shall not eat the life with the flesh.
\[24]Thou shall not eat it. Thou shall pour it out upon the ground as water.
\[25]Thou shall not eat it, that it may go well with thee, and with thy sons after thee, when thou shall do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah.
\[26]Only thy holy things which thou have, and thy vows, thou shall take, and go to the place which Jehovah shall choose.
\[27]And thou shall offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of Jehovah thy God, and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of Jehovah thy God, and thou shall eat the flesh.
\[28]Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy sons after thee forever, when thou do that which is good and right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God.
\[29]When Jehovah thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, where thou go in to dispossess them, and thou dispossess them, and dwell in their land,
\[30]take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them, after they are destroyed from before thee, and that thou not inquire after their gods, saying, How do these nations serve their gods? Even so I will do likewise.
\[31]Thou shall not do so to Jehovah thy God. For every abomination to Jehovah, which he hates, they have done to their gods, for they even burn their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods.
\[32]Whatever thing I command you, that shall ye observe to do. Thou shall not add to it, nor diminish from it.

\[19]When thou shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shall not destroy the trees of it by wielding an axe against them, for thou may eat of them. And thou shall not cut them down, for is the tree of the field a man, that it should be besieged by thee?
\[20]Only the trees of which thou know that they are not trees for food, thou shall destroy and cut them down. And thou shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with thee, until it falls.

\[2]then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth. And they shall measure to the cities which are round about him who is slain,
\[3]and it shall be, that the city which is nearest to the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which has not been worked with, and which has not drawn in the yoke,
\[4]and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley.
\[5]And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near, for Jehovah thy God has chosen them to minister to him, and to bless in the name of Jehovah, and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be.
\[6]And all the elders of that city, who are nearest to the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley,
\[7]and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.
\[8]Forgive, O Jehovah, thy people Israel whom thou have redeemed, and allow no innocent blood to remain in the midst of thy people Israel. And the blood shall be forgiven them.
\[9]So shall thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee when thou shall do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah.
\[10]When thou go forth to battle against thine enemies, and Jehovah thy God delivers them into thy hands, and thou carry them away captive,
\[11]and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and thou have a desire for her, and would take her to thee to wife,
\[12]then thou shall bring her home to thy house. And she shall shave her head, and pare her nails,
\[13]and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month. And after that thou shall go in to her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.
\[14]And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shall let her go where she will, but thou shall not sell her at all for money. Thou shall not deal with her harshly, because thou have humbled her.
\[15]If a man has two wives, the one beloved, and the other regarded inferior, and they have borne him sons, both the beloved and the one regarded inferior, and if the firstborn son be hers who was regarded inferior,
\[16]then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the one regarded inferior, who is the firstborn.
\[17]But he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the one regarded inferior, by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the beginning of his strength. The right of the firstborn is his.
\[18]If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not hearken to them,
\[19]then his father and his mother shall lay hold on him, and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate of his place.
\[20]And they shall say to the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice. He is a glutton, and a drunkard.
\[21]And all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones. So thou shall put away the evil from the midst of thee, and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
\[22]And if a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree,
\[23]his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shall surely bury him the same day, for he who is hanged is accursed of God, that thou not defile thy land which Jehovah thy God gives thee for an inheritance.

\[3]And so shall thou do with his donkey, and so shall thou do with his garment, and so shall thou do with every lost thing of thy brother's, which he has lost, and thou have found. Thou may not hide thyself.

\[6]If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young or upon the eggs, thou shall not take the dam with the young.

\[13]If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, and dislikes her,
\[14]and charges her with shameful things, and brings up an evil name upon her, and says, I took this woman, and when I came near to her, I did not find in her the tokens of virginity,
\[15]then the father of the damsel, and her mother, shall take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity to the elders of the city in the gate.
\[16]And the damsel's father shall say to the elders, I gave my daughter to this man to wife, and he dislikes her.
\[17]And, lo, he has charged her with shameful things, saying, I did not find in thy daughter the tokens of virginity, and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city.
\[18]And the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him,
\[19]and they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them to the father of the damsel, because he has brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel, and she shall be his wife. He may not put her away all his days.
\[20]But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the damsel,
\[21]then they shall bring the damsel out to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has wrought folly in Israel, to play the harlot in her father's house. So shall thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.
\[22]If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, the man that lay with the woman, and the woman. So shall thou put away the evil from Israel.
\[23]If there be a damsel who is a virgin betrothed to a husband, and a man finds her in the city, and lies with her,
\[24]then ye shall bring them both out to the gate of that city. And ye shall stone them to death with stones, the damsel, because she did not cry out, being in the city, and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor's wife. So thou shall put away the evil from the midst of thee.
\[25]But if the man finds the damsel who is betrothed in the field, and the man forces her, and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die,
\[26]but to the damsel thou shall do nothing. There is in the damsel no sin worthy of death. For as when a man rises against his neighbor, and kills him, even so is this matter,
\[27]for he found her in the field, the betrothed damsel cried out, and there was none to save her.
\[28]If a man finds a damsel who is a virgin, who is not betrothed, and lays hold on her, and lies with her, and they be found,
\[29]then the man who lay with her shall give to the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he has humbled her. He may not put her away all his days.

\[29]and thou shall grope at noonday, as the blind man gropes in darkness. And thou shall not prosper in thy ways. And thou shall only be oppressed and robbed always, and there shall be none to save thee.
\[30]Thou shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her. Thou shall build a house, and thou shall not dwell in it. Thou shall plant a vineyard, and shall not use the fruit of it.
\[31]Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shall not eat of it. Thy donkey shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee. Thy sheep shall be given to thine enemies, and thou shall have none to save thee.
\[32]Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given to another people. And thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day, and there shall be nothing in the power of thy hand.
\[33]The fruit of thy ground, and all thy labors, shall a nation eat up which thou know not. And thou shall only be oppressed and crushed always,
\[34]so that thou shall be mad because of the sight of thine eyes which thou shall see.
\[35]Jehovah will smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore boil, of which thou cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot to the crown of thy head.
\[36]Jehovah will bring thee, and thy king whom thou shall set over thee, to a nation that thou have not known, thou nor thy fathers. And there thou shall serve other gods, wood and stone.
\[37]And thou shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples where Jehovah shall lead thee away.
\[38]Thou shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather little in, for the locust shall consume it.
\[39]Thou shall plant vineyards and dress them, but thou shall neither drink of the wine, nor gather, for the worm shall eat them.
\[40]Thou shall have olive trees throughout all thy borders, but thou shall not anoint thyself with the oil, for thine olive shall drop off.
\[41]Thou shall beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be thine, for they shall go into captivity.
\[42]All thy trees and the fruit of thy ground shall the locust possess.
\[43]The sojourner who is in the midst of thee shall mount up above thee higher and higher, and thou shall come down lower and lower.
\[44]He shall lend to thee, and thou shall not lend to him. He shall be the head, and thou shall be the tail.
\[45]And all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed, because thou hearkened not to the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee,
\[46]and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed forever.
\[47]Because thou served not Jehovah thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things,
\[48]therefore thou shall serve thine enemies that Jehovah shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things. And he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he has destroyed thee.
\[49]Jehovah will bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flies, a nation whose tongue thou shall not understand,
\[50]a nation of fierce countenance, that shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young,
\[51]and shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy ground, until thou be destroyed, that also shall not leave thee grain, new wine, or oil, the increase of thy cattle, or the young of thy flock, until they have caused thee to perish.
\[52]And they shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fortified walls come down, in which thou trusted, throughout all thy land. And they shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which Jehovah thy God has given thee.
\[53]And thou shall eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, whom Jehovah thy God has given thee, in the siege and in the distress with which thine enemies shall distress thee.
\[54]The man who is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his sons whom he has remaining,
\[55]so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his sons whom he shall eat, because he has nothing left to him, in the siege and in the distress with which thine enemy shall distress thee in all thy gates.
\[56]The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,
\[57]and toward her young one who comes out from between her feet, and toward her sons whom she shall bear, for she shall eat them secretly for want of all things, in the siege and in the distress with which thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.
\[58]If thou will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou may fear this glorious and fearful name, JEHOVAH THY GOD,
\[59]then Jehovah will make thy calamities extraordinary, and the calamities of thy seed, even great calamities and of long continuance, and severe sicknesses and of long continuance.
\[60]And he will bring upon thee again all the diseases of Egypt, which thou were afraid of, and they shall cling to thee.
\[61]Also every sickness, and every calamity, which is not written in the book of this law, them Jehovah will bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.
\[62]And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude, because thou did not hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God.
\[63]And it shall come to pass, that, as Jehovah rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so Jehovah will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you. And ye shall be plucked from off the land where thou go in to possess it.
\[64]And Jehovah will scatter thee among all peoples, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth. And there thou shall serve other gods, which thou have not known, thou nor thy fathers, even wood and stone.
\[65]And among these nations thou shall find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of thy foot, but Jehovah will give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and pining of soul.
\[66]And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee, and thou shall fear night and day, and shall have no assurance of thy life.
\[67]In the morning thou shall say, Would it were evening! and at evening thou shall say, Would it were morning! for the fear of thy heart which thou shall fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shall see.
\[68]And Jehovah will bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way of which I said to thee, Thou shall see it no more again. And there ye shall sell yourselves to your enemies for bondmen and for bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.

hese are the words of the covenant which Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.
\[2]And Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, Ye have seen all that Jehovah did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
\[3]the great trials which thine eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders,
\[4]yet Jehovah has not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.
\[5]And I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not grown old upon you, and thy shoe has not grown old upon thy foot.
\[6]Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink, that ye may know that I am Jehovah your God.
\[7]And when ye came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us to battle, and we smote them.
\[8]And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites.
\[9]Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.
\[10]Ye stand this day all of you before Jehovah your God-your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel,
\[11]your little ones, your wives, and thy sojourner who is in the midst of thy camps, from the hewer of thy wood to the drawer of thy water-
\[12]that thou may enter into the covenant of Jehovah thy God, and into his oath, which Jehovah thy God makes with thee this day,
\[13]that he may establish thee this day to himself for a people, and that he may be to thee a God, as he spoke to thee, and as he swore to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
\[14]Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath,
\[15]but with him who stands here with us this day before Jehovah our God, and also with him who is not here with us this day
\[16](for ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which ye passed,
\[17]and ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them).
\[18]Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from Jehovah our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations. Lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood,
\[19]and it comes to pass, when he hears the words of this curse, that he blesses himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry.
\[20]Jehovah will not pardon him, but then the anger of Jehovah and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie upon him, and Jehovah will blot out his name from under heaven.
\[21]And Jehovah will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law.
\[22]And the generation to come, your sons who shall rise up after you, and the foreigner who shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the calamities of that land, and the sicknesses with which Jehovah has made it sick.
\[23]The whole land of it is brimstone, and salt, a burning. It is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows in it, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath,
\[24]even all the nations shall say, Why has Jehovah done thus to this land? What is the meaning of the heat of this great anger?
\[25]Then men shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,
\[26]and went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods that they knew not, and that he had not given to them.
\[27]Therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book.
\[28]And Jehovah rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day.
\[29]The secret things belong to Jehovah our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our sons forever, that we may do all the words of this law.

\[2]and shall return to Jehovah thy God, and shall obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy sons, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
\[3]that then Jehovah thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples where Jehovah thy God has scattered thee.
\[4]If any of thine outcasts be in the outermost parts of heaven, from there Jehovah thy God will gather thee, and from there he will fetch thee.
\[5]And Jehovah thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shall possess it, and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.
\[6]And Jehovah thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, that thou may live.
\[7]And Jehovah thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on those who hate thee, who persecuted thee.
\[8]And thou shall return and obey the voice of Jehovah, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.
\[9]And Jehovah thy God will make thee plenteous in all the work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, for good. For Jehovah will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers,
\[10]if thou shall obey the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if thou turn to Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.
\[11]For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off.
\[12]It is not in heaven, that thou should say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?
\[13]Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou should say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?
\[14]But the word is very near to thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou may do it.
\[15]See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil,
\[16]in that I command thee this day to love Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, that thou may live and multiply, and that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in the land where thou go in to possess it.
\[17]But if thy heart turns away, and thou will not hear, but shall be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them,
\[18]I declare to you this day, that ye shall surely perish. Ye shall not prolong your days in the land where thou pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it.
\[19]I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that thou may live, thou and thy seed,
\[20]to love Jehovah thy God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him, for he is thy life, and the length of thy days, that thou may dwell in the land which Jehovah swore to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

nd Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
\[2]And he said to them, I am a hundred and twenty years old this day. I can no more go out and come in. And Jehovah has said to me, Thou shall not go over this Jordan.
\[3]Jehovah thy God, he will go over before thee. He will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shall dispossess them. Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as Jehovah has spoken.
\[4]And Jehovah will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, whom he destroyed.
\[5]And Jehovah will deliver them up before you, and ye shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you.
\[6]Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be frightened at them, for Jehovah thy God, he it is who goes with thee. He will not leave thee, nor forsake thee.
\[7]And Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of good courage. For thou shall go with this people into the land which Jehovah has sworn to their fathers to give them, and thou shall cause them to inherit it.
\[8]And Jehovah, he it is who goes before thee. He will be with thee. He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. Fear not, neither be dismayed.
\[9]And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and to all the elders of Israel.
\[10]And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,
\[11]when all Israel has come to appear before Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
\[12]Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and thy sojourner who is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Jehovah your God, and observe to do all the words of this law,
\[13]and that their sons who have not known may hear, and learn to fear Jehovah your God as long as ye live in the land where ye go over the Jordan to possess it.
\[14]And Jehovah said to Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die. Call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may give him a command. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.
\[15]And Jehovah appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the tent.
\[16]And Jehovah said to Moses, Behold, thou shall sleep with thy fathers. And this people will rise up, and play the harlot after the strange gods of the land where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
\[17]Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them, so that they will say in that day, Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?
\[18]And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they have turned to other gods.
\[19]Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach thou it the sons of Israel. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the sons of Israel.
\[20]For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat, then they will turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.
\[21]And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles have come upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness, for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed. For I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.
\[22]So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the sons of Israel.
\[23]And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a command, and said, Be strong and of good courage, for thou shall bring the sons of Israel into the land which I swore to them, and I will be with thee.
\[24]And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
\[25]that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, saying,
\[26]Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.
\[27]For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck. Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against Jehovah, and how much more after my death?
\[28]Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
\[29]For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you. And evil will befall you in the latter days, because ye will do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.
\[30]And Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished:

ive ear, ye heavens, and I will speak, and let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
\[2]My doctrine shall drop as the rain. My speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender grass, and as the showers upon the herb.
\[3]For I will proclaim the name of Jehovah. Ascribe ye greatness to our God.
\[4]The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are justice, a God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is he.
\[5]They have dealt corruptly with him. They are not his sons, it is their blemish, a perverse and crooked generation.
\[6]Do ye thus requite Jehovah, O foolish people and unwise? Is not he thy father who has bought thee? He has made thee, and established thee.
\[7]Remember the days of old. Consider the years of many generations. Ask thy father, and he will show thee, thine elders, and they will tell thee.
\[8]When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of men, he set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel.
\[9]For Jehovah's portion is his people. Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.
\[10]He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness. He compassed him about. He cared for him. He kept him as the apple of his eye.
\[11]As an eagle that stirs up her nest, that flutters over her young, he spread abroad his wings. He took them. He bore them on his pinions.
\[12]Jehovah alone led him, and there was no foreign god with him.
\[13]He made him ride on the high places of the earth, and he ate the increase of the field, and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock,
\[14]butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the finest of the wheat, and of the blood of the grape thou drank wine.
\[15]But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked. Thou have grown fat. Thou have grown thick. Thou have become sleek. Then he forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
\[16]They moved him to jealousy with strange gods. With abominations they provoked him to anger.
\[17]They sacrificed to demons, not God, to gods that they knew not, to new gods that came up of late, which your fathers did not dread.
\[18]Thou are unmindful of the Rock that begot thee, and have forgotten God who gave thee birth.
\[19]And Jehovah saw, and abhorred, because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.
\[20]And he said, I will hide my face from them. I will see what their end shall be. For they are a very perverse generation, sons in whom is no faithfulness.
\[21]They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God. They have provoked me to anger with their vanities, and I will move them to jealousy with a non-nation. I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
\[22]For a fire is kindled in my anger, and burns to the lowest Sheol, and devours the earth with its increase, and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.
\[23]I will heap evils upon them. I will spend my arrows upon them,
\[24]to be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat and bitter destruction. And I will send upon them the teeth of beasts, with the poison of crawling things of the dust.
\[25]Outside the sword shall bereave, and in the chambers terror, to both young man and virgin, the suckling with the man of gray hairs.
\[26]I said, I would scatter them afar, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men,
\[27]were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, lest their adversaries should judge amiss, lest they should say, Our hand is exalted, and Jehovah has not done all this.
\[28]For they are a nation void of counsel, and there is no understanding in them.
\[29]Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!
\[30]How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight unless their Rock had sold them, and Jehovah had delivered them up?
\[31]For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.
\[32]For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter.
\[33]Their wine is the poison of serpents, and the cruel venom of asps.
\[34]Is not this laid up in store with me, sealed up among my treasures?
\[35]Vengeance is for me, and recompense at the time when their foot shall slide. For the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that are to come upon them shall make haste.
\[36]For Jehovah will judge his people, and regrets for his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, and there is none remaining, shut up or left at large.
\[37]And he will say, Where are their gods, the rock in which they took refuge,
\[38]which ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you, let them be your protection.
\[39]See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me. I kill, and I make alive. I wound, and I heal. And there is none that can deliver out of my hand.
\[40]For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, As I live forever,
\[41]if I whet my glittering sword, and my hand takes hold on judgment, I will render vengeance to my adversaries, and will recompense those who hate me.
\[42]I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh, with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the head of the leaders of the enemy.
\[43]Rejoice, O ye Gentiles, with his people. For he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will recompense those who hate him, and will make expiation for his land, for his people.
\[44]And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.
\[45]And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel.
\[46]And he said to them, Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you this day, which ye shall command your sons to observe to do, even all the words of this law.
\[47]For it is no vain thing for you, because it is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land where ye go over the Jordan to possess it.
\[48]And Jehovah spoke to Moses that selfsame day, saying,
\[49]Get thee up onto this mountain of Abarim, to mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is opposite Jericho, and behold the land of Canaan, which I give to the sons of Israel for a possession.
\[50]And die on the mount where thou go up, and be gathered to thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his people,
\[51]because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, because ye did not sanctify me in the midst of the sons of Israel.

\[3]Yea, he loves the people. All his sanctified are in thy hand, and they sat down at thy feet. He shall receive from thy words.
\[4]Moses commanded for us a law, an inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.
\[5]And he was king in Jeshurun when the heads of the people were gathered, all the tribes of Israel together.
\[6]Let Reuben live, and not die, nor let his men be few.
\[7]And this is of Judah: And he said, Hear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah, and bring him into his people. With his hands he contended for himself, and thou shall be a help against his adversaries.
\[8]And of Levi he said, Thy Thummim and thy Urim are with thy holy man, whom thou proved at Massah, with whom thou strove at the waters of Meribah,
\[9]who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him, neither did he acknowledge his brothers, nor knew he his own sons, for they have observed thy word, and keep thy covenant.
\[10]They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances, and Israel thy law. They shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt offering upon thine altar.
\[11]Bless, Jehovah, his substance, and accept the work of his hands. Smite through the loins of those who rise up against him, and of those who hate him, that they not rise again.
\[12]Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell in safety by him. He covers him all the day long, and he dwells between his shoulders.
\[13]And of Joseph he said, Blessed of Jehovah be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that couches beneath,
\[14]and for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, and for the precious things of the growth of the moons,
\[15]and for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the everlasting hills,
\[16]and for the precious things of the earth and the fullness of it, and the good will of him who dwelt in the bush. Let it come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers.
\[17]The firstling of his herd, majesty is his. And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox. With them he shall push the peoples, all of them, even the ends of the earth. And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.
\[18]And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out, and, Issachar, in thy tents.
\[19]They shall call the peoples to the mountain. There they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness, for they shall suck the abundance of the seas, and the hidden treasures of the sand.
\[20]And of Gad he said, Blessed be he who enlarges Gad. He dwells as a lioness, and tears the arm, yea, the crown of the head.
\[21]And he provided the first part for himself, for there was the lawgiver's portion reserved. And he came with the heads of the people. He executed the righteousness of Jehovah, and his ordinances with Israel.
\[22]And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp that leaps forth from Bashan.
\[23]And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of Jehovah, possess thou the west and the south.
\[24]And of Asher he said, Blessed be Asher with sons. Let him be acceptable to his brothers, and let him dip his foot in oil.
\[25]Thy bars shall be iron and brass, and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.
\[26]There is none like God, O Jeshurun, who rides upon the heavens for thy help, and in his excellency on the skies.
\[27]The eternal God is thy dwelling-place, and underneath are the everlasting arms. And he thrust out the enemy from before thee, and said, Destroy.
\[28]And Israel dwells in safety, the fountain of Jacob alone, in a land of grain and new wine. Yea, his heavens drop down dew.
\[29]Happy are thou, O Israel. Who is like thee, a people saved by Jehovah, the shield of thy help, and the sword of thy excellency! And thine enemies shall submit themselves to thee, and thou shall tread upon their high places.

nd Moses went up from the plains of Moab to mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is opposite Jericho. And Jehovah showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,
\[2]and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the farther sea,
\[3]and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, to Zoar.
\[4]And Jehovah said to him, This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give it to thy seed. I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shall not go over there.
\[5]So Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of Jehovah.
\[6]And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth-peor, but no man knows of his sepulcher to this day.
\[7]And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
\[8]And the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. So the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.
\[9]And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands upon him. And the sons of Israel hearkened to him, and did as Jehovah commanded Moses.
\[10]And there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face,
\[11]in all the signs and the wonders, which Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
\[12]and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.

ow it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,
\[2]Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, to the land which I give to them, even to the sons of Israel.
\[3]Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, to you I have given it, as I spoke to Moses.
\[4]From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.
\[5]There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
\[6]Be strong and of good courage, for thou shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.
\[7]Only be strong and very courageous to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee. Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou may have good success wherever thou go.
\[8]This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shall meditate on it day and night, that thou may observe to do according to all that is written in it, for then thou shall make thy way prosperous, and then thou shall have good success.
\[9]Have I not commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage. Be not frightened, neither be thou dismayed, for Jehovah thy God is with thee wherever thou go.
\[10]Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
\[11]Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare food for you, for within three days ye are to pass over this Jordan to go in to possess the land, which Jehovah your God gives you to possess it.
\[12]And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua spoke, saying,
\[13]Remember the word which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God gives you rest, and will give you this land.
\[14]Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall abide in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but ye shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them
\[15]until Jehovah has given your brothers rest, as you, and they also have possessed the land which Jehovah your God gives them. Then ye shall return to the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.
\[16]And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou have commanded us we will do, and wherever thou send us we will go.
\[17]According as we hearkened to Moses in all things, so will we hearken to thee. Only Jehovah thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.
\[18]Whoever he is who shall rebel against thy commandment, and shall not hearken to thy words in all that thou command him, he shall be put to death. Only be strong and of good courage.

nd Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men as spies secretly, saying, Go, view the land, and Jericho. And they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay down there.
\[2]And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, men came in here tonight of the sons of Israel to search out the land.
\[3]And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men who came to thee, who have entered into thy house, for they have come to search out all the land.
\[4]And the woman took the two men, and hid them. And she said, Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know from where they were.
\[5]And it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out. Where the men went I know not. Pursue after them quickly, for ye will overtake them.
\[6]But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.
\[7]And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan to the fords, and as soon as those who pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.
\[8]And before they were laid down, she came up to them upon the roof.
\[9]And she said to the men, I know that Jehovah has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen upon us. And that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.
\[10]For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when ye came out of Egypt, and what ye did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
\[11]And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man because of you, for Jehovah your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.
\[12]Now therefore, I pray you, swear to me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a true token,
\[13]and that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.
\[14]And the men said to her, Our life for yours if ye do not utter this our business. And it shall be, when Jehovah gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.
\[15]Then she let them down by a cord through the window, for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
\[16]And she said to them, Get you to the mountain lest the pursuers come upon you. And hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned, and afterward ye may go your way.
\[17]And the men said to her, We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou have made us to swear.
\[18]Behold, when we come into the land, thou shall bind this line of scarlet cord in the window which thou let us down by. And thou shall gather to thee into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brothers, and all thy father's household.
\[19]And it shall be, that whoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless. And whoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him.
\[20]But if thou utter this our business, then we shall be guiltless of thine oath which thou have made us to swear.
\[21]And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed. And she bound the scarlet line in the window.
\[22]And they went, and came to the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned. And the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but did not find them.
\[23]Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun. And they told him all that had befallen them.
\[24]And they said to Joshua, Truly Jehovah has delivered into our hands all the land, and moreover all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us.

\[2]And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp,
\[3]and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall move from your place, and go after it.
\[4]Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Do not come near to it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go, for ye have not passed this way heretofore.
\[5]And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonders among you.
\[6]And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
\[7]And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day I will begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.
\[8]And thou shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye have come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan.
\[9]And Joshua said to the sons of Israel, Come here, and hear the words of Jehovah your God.
\[10]And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite.
\[11]Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan.
\[12]Now therefore take for you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.
\[13]And it shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, even the waters that come down from above, and they shall stand in one heap.
\[14]And it came to pass, when the people moved from their tents to pass over the Jordan-the priests who bore the ark of the covenant being before the people-
\[15]and when those who bore the ark came to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest),
\[16]that the waters which came down from above, stood, and rose up in one heap a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off. And the people passed over right against Jericho.
\[17]And the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all Israel passed over on dry ground until all the nation were passed clean over the Jordan.

\[2]Take for you twelve men out of the people, a man out of every tribe,
\[3]and command ye them, saying, Take for you here out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging-place where ye shall lodge this night.
\[4]Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the sons of Israel, a man out of every tribe.
\[5]And Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,
\[6]that this may be a sign among you, that, when your children ask in time to come, saying, What do ye mean by these stones?
\[7]Then ye shall say to them, Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah. When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones shall be for a memorial to the sons of Israel forever.
\[8]And the sons of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.
\[9]And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood, and they are there to this day.
\[10]For the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. And the people hastened and passed over.
\[11]And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of Jehovah passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.
\[12]And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the sons of Israel, as Moses spoke to them.
\[13]About forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before Jehovah to battle, to the plains of Jericho.
\[14]On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
\[15]And Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying,
\[16]Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.
\[17]Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of the Jordan.
\[18]And it came to pass, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came up out of the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and went over all its banks, as formerly.
\[19]And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho.
\[20]And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal.
\[21]And he spoke to the sons of Israel, saying, When your sons shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What do these stones mean?
\[22]Then ye shall let your sons know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
\[23]For Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as Jehovah your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were passed over,

nd it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard how that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the sons of Israel until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the sons of Israel.
\[2]At that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make for thee knives of flint, and circumcise again the sons of Israel the second time.
\[3]And Joshua made him knives of flint, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
\[4]And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised: All the people who came forth out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way after they came forth out of Egypt.
\[5]For all the people who came out were circumcised, but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised.
\[6]For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness till all the nation, even the men of war who came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they did not hearken to the voice of Jehovah, to whom Jehovah swore that he would not let them see the land which Jehovah swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
\[7]And their sons, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way.
\[8]And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the nation, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were recovered.
\[9]And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, to this day.
\[10]And the sons of Israel encamped in Gilgal. And they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.
\[11]And they ate of the produce of the land on the morrow after the Passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain, in the selfsame day.
\[12]And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the produce of the land. Neither had the sons of Israel manna any more, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
\[13]And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are thou for us, or for our adversaries?
\[14]And he said, No, but as captain of the army of Jehovah I have now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and said to him, What does my lord say to his servant?
\[15]And the captain of Jehovah's army said to Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place on which thou stand is holy. And Joshua did so.

ow Jericho was shut up tight because of the sons of Israel. None went out, and none came in.
\[2]And Jehovah said to Joshua, See, I have given Jericho into thy hand, and the king of it, and the mighty men of valor.
\[3]And ye shall encompass the city, all the men of war, going around the city once. Thus shall thou do six days.
\[4]And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark. And the seventh day ye shall encompass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.
\[5]And it shall be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout. And the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.
\[6]And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Jehovah.
\[7]And they said to the people, Pass on, and encompass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of Jehovah.
\[8]And it was so, that, when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before Jehovah passed on, and blew the trumpets. And the ark of the covenant of Jehovah followed them.
\[9]And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rearward went behind the ark, the priests blowing the trumpets as they went.
\[10]And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout. Then ye shall shout.
\[11]So he caused the ark of Jehovah to encompass the city, going around it once. And they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.
\[12]And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Jehovah.
\[13]And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Jehovah went on continually, and blew the trumpets. And the armed men went before them, and the rearward came behind the ark of Jehovah, the priests blowing the trumpets as they went.
\[14]And the second day they encompassed the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.
\[15]And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and encompassed the city according to the same manner seven times. Only on that day they encompassed the city seven times.
\[16]And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout, for Jehovah has given you the city.
\[17]And the city shall be set apart, even it and all that is in it, to Jehovah. Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
\[18]But as for you, only keep yourselves from what is set apart, lest when ye have set it apart, ye take from what is set apart. So ye would make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.
\[19]But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy to Jehovah. They shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.
\[20]So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets. And it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.
\[21]And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.
\[22]And Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out from there the woman, and all that she has, as ye swore to her.
\[23]And the young men, the spies, went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brothers, and all that she had. They also brought out all her kindred, and they set them outside the camp of Israel.
\[24]And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.
\[25]But Joshua saved alive Rahab the harlot, and her father's household, and all that she had. And she dwelt in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
\[26]And Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah who rises up and builds this city Jericho. With the loss of his firstborn he shall lay the foundation of it, and with the loss of his youngest son he shall set up the gates of it.

ut the sons of Israel committed a trespass in what was set apart. For Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took from what was set apart, and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the sons of Israel.
\[2]And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.
\[3]And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai. Do not make all the people to toil there, for they are but few.
\[4]So there went up there of the people about three thousand men. And they fled before the men of Ai.
\[5]And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty-six men. And they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and smote them at the descent. And the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.
\[6]And Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and they put dust upon their heads.
\[7]And Joshua said, Alas, O lord Jehovah, why have thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? Would that we had been content and dwelt beyond the Jordan!
\[8]Oh, Lord, what shall I say after Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!
\[9]For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will encompass us around, and cut off our name from the earth, and what will thou do for thy great name?
\[10]And Jehovah said to Joshua, Get thee up. Why are thou thus fallen upon thy face?
\[11]Israel has sinned. Yes, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them. Yes, they have even taken from what was set apart, and have also stolen, and also dissembled. And they have even put it among their own stuff.
\[12]Therefore the sons of Israel cannot stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies because they have become accursed. I will not be with you any more unless ye destroy what was set apart from among you.
\[13]Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow. For thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, There is what has been set apart in the midst of thee, O Israel. Thou cannot stand before thine enemies until ye take away the devoted thing from among you.
\[14]In the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes, and it shall be, that the tribe which Jehovah takes shall come near by families, and the family which Jehovah shall take shall come near by households, and the household which Jehovah shall take shall come near man by man.
\[15]And it shall be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because he has wrought folly in Israel.
\[16]So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken.
\[17]And he brought near the family of Judah, and he took the family of the Zerahites. And he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was taken.
\[18]And he brought near his household man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
\[19]And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to Jehovah, the God of Israel, and make confession to him, and tell me now what thou have done. Hide it not from me.
\[20]And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against Jehovah, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
\[21]When I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonian mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them. And, behold, they are hid in the ground in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
\[22]So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. And, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
\[23]And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the sons of Israel, and they laid them down before Jehovah.
\[24]And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his donkeys, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had, and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.
\[25]And Joshua said, Why have thou troubled us? Jehovah shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.
\[26]And they raised over him a great heap of stones, to this day, and Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called the valley of Achor to this day.

\[2]And thou shall do to Ai and its king as thou did to Jericho and its king. Only the spoil of it, and the cattle of it, ye shall take for a prey to yourselves. Set thee an ambush for the city behind it.
\[3]So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai. And Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night.
\[4]And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready,
\[5]and I, and all the people that are with me, will approach to the city. And it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them.
\[6]And they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first. So we will flee before them.
\[7]And ye shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city, for Jehovah your God will deliver it into your hand.
\[8]And it shall be, when ye have seized upon the city, that ye shall set the city on fire. According to the word of Jehovah shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.
\[9]And Joshua sent them forth, and they went to the ambushment, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai, but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
\[10]And Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
\[11]And all the people, even the men of war who were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between him and Ai.
\[12]And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.
\[13]So they set the people, even all the army that was on the north of the city, and their ambushment that were on the west of the city, and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
\[14]And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hastened and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah, but he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.
\[15]And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
\[16]And all the people that were in the city were called together to pursue after them, and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
\[17]And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel. And they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.
\[18]And Jehovah said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai, for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.
\[19]And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it. And they hastened and set the city on fire.
\[20]And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way. And the people who fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
\[21]And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and killed the men of Ai.
\[22]And the others came forth out of the city against them, so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side. And they smote them so that they let none of them remain or escape.
\[23]And they took the king of Ai alive, and brought him to Joshua.
\[24]And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, that all Israel returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
\[25]And all who fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.
\[26]For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
\[27]Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey to themselves, according to the word of Jehovah which he commanded Joshua.
\[28]So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation, to this day.
\[29]And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until the evening. And at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised a great heap of stones on it, to this day.
\[30]Then Joshua built an altar to Jehovah, the God of Israel, in mount Ebal,
\[31]as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man had lifted up any iron. And they offered burnt offerings on it to Jehovah, and sacrificed peace offerings.
\[32]And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the sons of Israel.
\[33]And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, as well the sojourner as the home born, half of them in front of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.
\[34]And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
\[35]There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners who were among them.

nd it came to pass, when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon-the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite-heard of it,
\[2]that they gathered themselves together to fight with Joshua and with Israel with one accord.
\[3]But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
\[4]they also worked shrewdly, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their donkeys, and wine-skins, old and torn and bound up,
\[5]and old and patched shoes upon their feet, and old garments upon them, and all the bread of their provision was dry and became moldy.
\[6]And they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, We have come from a far country, now therefore make ye a covenant with us.
\[7]And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, Perhaps ye dwell among us, and how shall we make a covenant with you?
\[8]And they said to Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said to them, Who are ye, and from where do ye come?
\[9]And they said to him, From a very far country. Thy servants have come because of the name of Jehovah thy God, for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
\[10]and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.
\[11]And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, We are your servants, and now make ye a covenant with us.
\[12]This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go to you, but now, behold, it is dry, and has become moldy.
\[13]And these wine-skins, which we filled, were new, and, behold, they are torn. And these our garments and our shoes have become old by reason of the very long journey.
\[14]And the men took of their provision, and did not ask counsel at the mouth of Jehovah.
\[15]And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them to let them live, and the rulers of the congregation swore to them.
\[16]And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.
\[17]And the sons of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
\[18]And the sons of Israel did not smite them, because the rulers of the congregation had sworn to them by Jehovah, the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the rulers.
\[19]But all the rulers said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by Jehovah, the God of Israel, now therefore we may not touch them.
\[20]This we will do to them, and let them live, lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we swore to them.
\[21]And the rulers said to them, Let them live. So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water to all the congregation, as the rulers had spoken to them.
\[22]And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you, when ye dwell among us?
\[23]Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall never fail to be bondmen of you, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.
\[24]And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that Jehovah thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you. Therefore we were very afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
\[25]And now, behold, we are in thy hand. As it seems good and right to thee to do to us, do.
\[26]And so he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the sons of Israel, that they did not kill them.
\[27]And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of Jehovah to this day in the place which he should choose.

ow it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it, as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king, and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them,
\[2]that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men of it were mighty.
\[3]Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
\[4]Come up to me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel.
\[5]Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their armies, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.
\[6]And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants. Come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill-country are gathered together against us.
\[7]So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
\[8]And Jehovah said to Joshua, Fear them not, for I have delivered them into thy hands. There shall not a man of them stand before thee.
\[9]Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly, for he went up from Gilgal all the night.
\[10]And Jehovah discomfited them before Israel, and he killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and to Makkedah.
\[11]And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them to Azekah, and they died. More died with the hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel killed with the sword.
\[12]Then Joshua spoke to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah delivered up the Amorites before the sons of Israel. And he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.
\[13]And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hastened not to go down about a whole day.
\[14]And there was no day like that before it or after it, that Jehovah hearkened to the voice of a man, for Jehovah fought for Israel.
\[15]And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
\[16]And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
\[17]And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.
\[18]And Joshua said, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them,
\[19]but stay ye not. Pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them. Do not allow them to enter into their cities, for Jehovah your God has delivered them into your hand.
\[20]And it came to pass, when Joshua and the sons of Israel had made an end of killing them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,
\[21]that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. No man moved his tongue against any of the sons of Israel.
\[22]Then Joshua said, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings to me out of the cave.
\[23]And they did so, and brought forth those five kings to him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.
\[24]And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.
\[25]And Joshua said to them, Fear not, nor be dismayed. Be strong and of good courage, for thus shall Jehovah do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.
\[26]And afterward Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees. And they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
\[27]And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, to this very day.
\[28]And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king of it. He utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were in it. He left none remaining, and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
\[29]And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.
\[30]And Jehovah delivered it also, and the king of it, into the hand of Israel. And he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were in it. He left none remaining in it, and he did to the king of it as he had done to the king of Jericho.
\[31]And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it.
\[32]And Jehovah delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel. And he took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were in it, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
\[33]Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish. And Joshua smote him and his people until he had left him none remaining.
\[34]And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon. And they encamped against it, and fought against it.
\[35]And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword. And all the souls that were in it he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
\[36]And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron. And they fought against it,
\[37]and they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king of it, and all the cities of it, and all the souls that were in it. He left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon, but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls that were in it.
\[38]And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it.
\[39]And he took it, and the king of it, and all the cities of it. And they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were in it. He left none remaining. As he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king of it, as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king of it.
\[40]So Joshua smote all the land, the hill-country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings. He left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded.
\[41]And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.
\[42]And all these kings and their land Joshua took at one time, because Jehovah, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
\[43]And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.

\[2]and to the kings who were on the north, in the hill-country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,
\[3]to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill-country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah,
\[4]and they went out, they and all their armies with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots, very many.
\[5]And all these kings met together. And they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.
\[6]And Jehovah said to Joshua, Be not afraid because of them, for tomorrow at this time I will deliver them up all slain before Israel. Thou shall hock their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.
\[7]So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them.
\[8]And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them to great Sidon, and to Misrephoth-maim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward. And they smote them until they left them none remaining.
\[9]And Joshua did to them as Jehovah bade him. He hocked their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.
\[10]And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king of it with the sword, for Hazor was formerly the head of all those kingdoms.
\[11]And they smote all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was none left that breathed, and he burnt Hazor with fire.
\[12]And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, Joshua took, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded.
\[13]But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except only Hazor. Joshua burned that.
\[14]And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the sons of Israel took for a prey to themselves, but every man they smote with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, neither did they leave any who breathed.
\[15]As Jehovah commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did. He left nothing undone of all that Jehovah commanded Moses.
\[16]So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill-country of Israel, and the lowland of the same,
\[17]from mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon. And he took all their kings, and smote them, and put them to death.
\[18]Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
\[19]There was not a city that made peace with the sons of Israel, except the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took all in battle.
\[20]For it was of Jehovah to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them as Jehovah commanded Moses.
\[21]And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill-country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill-country of Judah, and from all the hill-country of Israel. Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
\[22]There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the sons of Israel. Only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod some remained.
\[23]So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Jehovah spoke to Moses. And Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land had rest from war.

ow Joshua was old and well stricken in years, and Jehovah said to him, Thou are old and well stricken in years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed.
\[2]This is the land that yet remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;
\[3]from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even to the border of Ekron northward, which is reckoned to the Canaanites; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim

\[6]all the inhabitants of the hill-country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians. I will drive them out from before the sons of Israel, only allot thou it to Israel for an inheritance as I have commanded thee.
\[7]Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
\[8]With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them:
\[9]from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon;

\[12]all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim), for these Moses smote, and drove them out.
\[13]Nevertheless the sons of Israel did not drive out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites, but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day.
\[14]Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance. The offerings of Jehovah, the God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance as he spoke to him.
\[15]And Moses gave to the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their families.
\[16]And their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;
\[17]Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon,
\[18]and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
\[19]and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar in the mount of the valley,
\[20]and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth,
\[21]and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the rulers of Sihon who dwelt in the land.
\[22]The sons of Israel also killed Balaam the son of Beor, the diviner, with the sword among the rest of their slain.
\[23]And the border of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan, and the border of it. This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families, the cities and the villages of it.
\[24]And Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad, according to their families.
\[25]And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon, to Aroer that is before Rabbah,
\[26]and from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir,

\[28]This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families, the cities and the villages of it.

\[2]by the lot of their inheritance, as Jehovah commanded by Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.
\[3]For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan, but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.
\[4]For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. And they gave no portion to the Levites in the land except cities to dwell in with the suburbs of it for their cattle and for their substance.
\[5]As Jehovah commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did, and they divided the land.
\[6]Then the sons of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, Thou know the thing that Jehovah spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning thee in Kadesh-barnea.

\[9]And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land in which thy foot has trodden shall be an inheritance to thee and to thy sons forever because thou have wholly followed Jehovah my God.
\[10]And now, behold, Jehovah has kept me alive, as he spoke, these forty-five years, from the time that Jehovah spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness. And now, lo, I am this day eighty-five years old.
\[11]As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me. As my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, and to go out and to come in.
\[12]Now therefore give me this hill-country of which Jehovah spoke in that day. For thou heard in that day how the Anakim were there, and cities great and fortified. It may be that Jehovah will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Jehovah spoke.
\[13]And Joshua blessed him, and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
\[14]Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day because he wholly followed Jehovah, the God of Israel.
\[15]Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba. Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.

\[17]And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it, and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

nd this was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. As for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
\[2]So it was for the rest of the sons of Manasseh according to their families: for the sons of Abiezer, and for the sons of Helek, and for the sons of Asriel, and for the sons of Shechem, and for the sons of Hepher, and for the sons of Shemida. These were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.
\[3]But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters. And these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
\[4]And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the rulers, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers. Therefore according to the commandment of Jehovah he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.
\[5]And there fell ten parts to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan,
\[6]because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
\[7]And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem. And the border went along to the right hand, to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
\[8]The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the sons of Ephraim.
\[9]And the border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook. These cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh. And the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook. And the goings out of it were at the sea.
\[10]Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea was his border, and they reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east.
\[11]And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher, Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, even the three heights.
\[12]Yet the sons of Manasseh could not drive out those cities, but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
\[13]And it came to pass, when the sons of Israel grew strong, that they put the Canaanites to task work, and did not utterly drive them out.
\[14]And the sons of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why have thou given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, inasmuch as until now Jehovah has blessed me?
\[15]And Joshua said to them, If thou be a great people, get thee up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim, since the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee.
\[16]And the sons of Joseph said, The hill-country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth-shean and its towns, and those who are in the valley of Jezreel.
\[17]And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou are a great people, and have great power. Thou shall not have only one lot,
\[18]but the hill-country shall be thine, for though it is a forest, thou shall cut it down, and the goings out of it shall be thine. For thou shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.

\[3]And Joshua said to the sons of Israel, How long are ye slack to go in to possess the land, which Jehovah, the God of your fathers, has given you?
\[4]Appoint for you three men of each tribe. And I will send them, and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance, and they shall come to me.
\[5]And they shall divide it into seven portions: Judah shall abide in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their border on the north.
\[6]And ye shall describe the land into seven portions, and bring it here to me. And I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah our God.
\[7]For the Levites have no portion among you, for the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance, and Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them.
\[8]And the men arose, and went. And Joshua charged those who went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me. And I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah in Shiloh.
\[9]And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven portions in a book. And they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.
\[10]And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Jehovah. And there Joshua divided the land to the sons of Israel according to their divisions.

\[14]And the border extended, and turned around on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lies before Beth-horon southward. And the goings out of it were at Kiriath-baal (the same is Kiriath-jearim), a city of the sons of Judah. This was the west quarter.
\[15]And the south quarter was from the uttermost part of Kiriath-jearim, and the border went out westward, and went out to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah,
\[16]and the border went down to the uttermost part of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the vale of Rephaim northward, and it went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel,

\[30]And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs, Abdon with its suburbs,
\[31]Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs; four cities.
\[32]And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Hammoth-dor with its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities.
\[33]All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
\[34]And to the families of the sons of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its suburbs, and Kartah with its suburbs,
\[35]Dimnah with its suburbs, Nahalal with its suburbs; four cities.
\[36]And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its suburbs, and Jahaz with its suburbs,
\[37]Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath with its suburbs; four cities.
\[38]And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Mahanaim with its suburbs,
\[39]Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs; four cities in all.
\[40]All these were the cities of the sons of Merari according to their families, even the rest of the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities.
\[41]All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the sons of Israel were forty-eight cities with their suburbs.
\[42]These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them. Thus it was with all these cities.
\[43]So Jehovah gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers, and they possessed it, and dwelt in it.
\[44]And Jehovah gave them rest round about, according to all that he swore to their fathers. And there stood not a man of all their enemies before them. Jehovah delivered all their enemies into their hand.
\[45]There failed not anything of any good thing which Jehovah had spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.

hen Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
\[2]and said to them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, and have hearkened to my voice in all that I commanded you.
\[3]Ye have not left your brothers these many days to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of Jehovah your God.
\[4]And now Jehovah your God has given rest to your brothers, as he spoke to them. Therefore now turn ye, and get you to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan.
\[5]Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, to love Jehovah your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cling to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.
\[6]So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away, and they went to their tents.
\[7]Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua gave among their brothers beyond the Jordan westward. Moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them,
\[8]and spoke to them, saying, Return with much wealth to your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment. Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.
\[9]And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the sons of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, of which they were possessed, according to the commandment of Jehovah by Moses.
\[10]And when they came to the region about the Jordan that is in the land of Canaan, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a great altar to look upon.
\[11]And the sons of Israel heard say, Behold, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertains to the sons of Israel.
\[12]And when the sons of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the sons of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.
\[13]And the sons of Israel sent Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead,
\[14]and with him ten rulers, one ruler of a fathers' house for each of the tribes of Israel. And they were each man of them head of their fathers' houses among the thousands of Israel.
\[15]And they came to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,
\[16]Thus says the whole congregation of Jehovah, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following Jehovah, in that ye have built for you an altar, to rebel this day against Jehovah?
\[17]Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although there came a plague upon the congregation of Jehovah,
\[18]that ye must turn away this day from following Jehovah? And it will be, seeing ye rebel today against Jehovah, that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
\[19]However, if the land of your possession is unclean, then pass ye over to the land of the possession of Jehovah, in which Jehovah's tabernacle dwells, and take possession among us, but do not rebel against Jehovah, nor rebel against us, in building for you an altar besides the altar of Jehovah our God.
\[20]Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in what was set apart, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? And that man did not perish alone in his iniquity.
\[21]Then the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel,
\[22]The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, the Mighty One, God, Jehovah, he knows, and Israel he shall know, if it is in rebellion, or if in trespass against Jehovah (do not save us this day),
\[23]that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Jehovah, or if to offer burnt offering or meal offering on it, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings on it, let Jehovah himself require it,
\[24]and if we have not rather out of carefulness done this, from purpose, saying, In time to come your sons might speak to our sons, saying, What have ye to do with Jehovah, the God of Israel?
\[25]For Jehovah has made the Jordan a border between us and you, ye sons of Reuben and sons of Gad. Ye have no portion in Jehovah. So your sons might make our sons cease from fearing Jehovah.
\[26]Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice,
\[27]but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of Jehovah before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings, that your sons may not say to our sons in time to come, Ye have no portion in Jehovah.
\[28]Therefore we said, It shall be, when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, Behold the pattern of the altar of Jehovah, which our fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice, but it is a witness between us and you.
\[29]Far be it from us that we should rebel against Jehovah, and turn away this day from following Jehovah, to build an altar for burnt offering, for meal offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of Jehovah our God that is before his tabernacle.
\[30]And when Phinehas the priest, and the rulers of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well.
\[31]And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Manasseh, This day we know that Jehovah is in the midst of us, because ye have not committed this trespass against Jehovah. Now ye have delivered the sons of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah.
\[32]And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the rulers, returned from the sons of Reuben, and from the sons of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and brought them word again.
\[33]And the thing pleased the sons of Israel. And the sons of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land in which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad dwelt.
\[34]And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad called the altar Witness. For, they said, it is a witness between us that Jehovah is God.

nd it came to pass after many days, when Jehovah had given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua was old and well stricken in years,
\[2]that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said to them, I am old and well stricken in years,
\[3]and ye have seen all that Jehovah your God has done to all these nations because of you, for Jehovah your God, he it is who has fought for you.
\[4]Behold, I have allotted to you these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea toward the going down of the sun.
\[5]And Jehovah your God, he will thrust them out from before you, and drive them from out of your sight. And ye shall possess their land, as Jehovah your God spoke to you.
\[6]Therefore be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye not turn aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;
\[7]that ye do not come among these nations, these that remain among you, neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves down to them,
\[8]but cling to Jehovah your God as ye have done to this day.
\[9]For Jehovah has driven out from before you great nations and strong. But as for you, no man has stood before you to this day.
\[10]One man of you shall chase a thousand, for Jehovah your God, he it is who fights for you, as he spoke to you.
\[11]Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that ye love Jehovah your God.
\[12]Else if ye do at all go back, and cling to the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and make marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you,
\[13]know for a certainty that Jehovah your God will no more drive these nations from out of your sight, but they shall be a snare and a trap to you, and a scourge in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which Jehovah your God has given you.
\[14]And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth. And ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing has failed of all the good things which Jehovah your God spoke concerning you. All have come to pass to you; not one thing has failed of it.
\[15]And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things have come upon you of which Jehovah your God spoke to you, so will Jehovah bring upon you all the evil things, until he has destroyed you from off this good land which Jehovah your God has given you.
\[16]When ye transgress the covenant of Jehovah your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow down yourselves to them, then the anger of Jehovah will be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he has given to you.

nd Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
\[2]And Joshua said to all the people, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel: Your fathers dwelt of old time beyond the River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor, and they served other gods.
\[3]And I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.
\[4]And I gave to Isaac, Jacob and Esau. And I gave to Esau mount Seir to possess it. And Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt.
\[5]And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in the midst of it, and afterward I brought you out.
\[6]And I brought your fathers out of Egypt. And ye came to the sea, and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen to the Red Sea.
\[7]And when they cried out to Jehovah, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them. And your eyes saw what I did in Egypt, and ye dwelt in the wilderness many days.
\[8]And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt beyond the Jordan. And they fought with you. And I gave them into your hand, and ye possessed their land, and I destroyed them from before you.
\[9]Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. And he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you,
\[10]but I would not hearken to Balaam. Therefore he blessed you greatly. So I delivered you out of his hand.
\[11]And ye went over the Jordan, and came to Jericho. And the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. And I delivered them into your hand.
\[12]And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites, not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.
\[13]And I gave you a land in which thou had not labored, and cities which ye did not build, and ye dwell in it. Ye eat of vineyards and oliveyards which ye did not plant.
\[14]Now therefore fear Jehovah, and serve him in sincerity and in truth. And put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt, and serve ye Jehovah.
\[15]And if it seems evil to you to serve Jehovah, choose you this day whom ye will serve: whether the gods which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah.
\[16]And the people answered and said, Far be it from us that we should forsake Jehovah, to serve other gods.
\[17]For Jehovah our God, he it is who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed.
\[18]And Jehovah drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who dwelt in the land. Therefore we also will serve Jehovah, for he is our God.
\[19]And Joshua said to the people, Ye cannot serve Jehovah, for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God. He will not forgive your transgression nor your sins.
\[20]If ye forsake Jehovah, and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after he has done you good.
\[21]And the people said to Joshua, No, but we will serve Jehovah.
\[22]And Joshua said to the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen for you, Jehovah, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.
\[23]Now therefore, he said, put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart to Jehovah, the God of Israel.
\[24]And the people said to Joshua, we will serve Jehovah our God, and we will hearken to his voice.
\[25]So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
\[26]And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God. And he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah.
\[27]And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of Jehovah which he spoke to us. It shall be therefore a witness against you, lest ye deny your God.
\[28]So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.
\[29]And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being a hundred and ten years old.
\[30]And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.
\[31]And Israel served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, and had known all the work of Jehovah that he had wrought for Israel.
\[32]And they buried the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought up out of Egypt, in Sicima, in the portion of the land which Jacob bought from the Amorites who dwelt in Sicima for a hundred ewe-lambs. And he gave it to Joseph for a portion.
\[33]And Eleazar the son of Aaron died. And they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill-country of Ephraim.

nd it came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the sons of Israel asked of Jehovah, saying, Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?
\[2]And Jehovah said, Judah shall go up. Behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
\[3]And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites, and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
\[4]And Judah went up, and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they smote of them in Bezek ten thousand men.
\[5]And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek, and they fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
\[6]But Adoni-bezek fled, and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
\[7]And Adoni-bezek said, Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered scraps under my table. As I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
\[8]And the sons of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
\[9]And afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the hill-country, and in the South, and in the lowland.
\[10]And Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron (now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba), and they smote Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
\[11]And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (Now the name of Debir was formerly Kiriath-sepher.)
\[12]And Caleb said, He who smites Kiriath-sepher, and takes it, I will give to him Achsah my daughter to wife.
\[13]And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it, and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
\[14]And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field. And she alighted from off her donkey, and Caleb said to her, What would thou?
\[15]And she said to him, Give me a blessing, since thou have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
\[16]And the sons of the Kenite, Moses' brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the sons of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad, and they went and dwelt with the people.
\[17]And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they smote the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.
\[18]Also Judah took Gaza with the border of it, and Ashkelon with the border of it, and Ekron with the border of it.
\[19]And Jehovah was with Judah, and drove out those of the hill-country. But they could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron.
\[20]And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had spoken, and he drove out the three sons of Anak from there.
\[21]And the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem, but the Jebusites dwell with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
\[22]And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel, and Jehovah was with them.
\[23]And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. (Now the name of the city was formerly Luz.)
\[24]And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with thee.
\[25]And he showed them the entrance into the city. And they smote the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man go and all his family.
\[26]And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name of it Luz, which is the name of it to this day.
\[27]And Manasseh did not drive out those of Beth-shean and its towns, nor of Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
\[28]And it came to pass, when Israel grew strong, that they put the Canaanites to task work, and did not utterly drive them out.
\[29]And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer, but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
\[30]Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol, but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became subject to task work.
\[31]Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob,
\[32]but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out.
\[33]Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to task work.
\[34]And the Amorites forced the sons of Dan into the hill-country, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley,
\[35]but the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim. Yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to task work.
\[36]And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.

nd the agent of Jehovah came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, I made you go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers. And I said, I will never break my covenant with you.
\[2]And ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land. Ye shall break down their altars. But ye have not hearkened to my voice. Why have ye done this?
\[3]Therefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you, but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.
\[4]And it came to pass, when the agent of Jehovah spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
\[5]And they called the name of that place Bochim, and they sacrificed there to Jehovah.
\[6]Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the sons of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.
\[7]And the people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Jehovah that he had wrought for Israel.
\[8]And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being a hundred and ten years old.
\[9]And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.
\[10]And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers. And there arose another generation after them that did not know Jehovah, nor yet the work which he had wrought for Israel.
\[11]And the sons of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baalim.
\[12]And they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves down to them. And they provoked Jehovah to anger.
\[13]And they forsook Jehovah, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
\[14]And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that despoiled them. And he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
\[15]Wherever they went out, the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah had spoken, and as Jehovah had sworn to them. And they were exceedingly distressed.
\[16]And Jehovah raised up judges who saved them out of the hand of those who despoiled them.
\[17]And yet they did not hearken to their judges, for they played the harlot after other gods, and bowed themselves down to them. They turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of Jehovah. They did not do so.
\[18]And when Jehovah raised up judges for them, then Jehovah was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. For Jehovah regretted because of their groaning because of those who oppressed them and vexed them.
\[19]But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them. They did not cease from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.
\[20]And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he said, Because this nation has transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not hearkened to my voice,
\[21]I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died,
\[22]that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of Jehovah to walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or not.
\[23]So Jehovah left those nations, without driving them out quickly. Neither did he deliver them into the hand of Joshua.

ow these are the nations which Jehovah left to prove Israel by them, (even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan,
\[2]only that the generations of the sons of Israel might know, to teach them war, at least to such as formerly knew nothing of that):
\[3]namely, the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath.
\[4]And they were left, to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken to the commandments of Jehovah, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.
\[5]And the sons of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
\[6]And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.
\[7]And the sons of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and forgot Jehovah their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth.
\[8]Therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia, And the sons of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.
\[9]And when the sons of Israel cried to Jehovah, Jehovah raised up a savior to the sons of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
\[10]And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he judged Israel. And he went out to war, and Jehovah delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand, and his hand prevailed against Cushan-rishathaim.
\[11]And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
\[12]And the sons of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah. And Jehovah strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.
\[13]And he gathered to him the sons of Ammon and Amalek, and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.
\[14]And the sons of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
\[15]But when the sons of Israel cried to Jehovah, Jehovah raised up for them a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. And the sons of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.
\[16]And Ehud made for himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length. And he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
\[17]And he offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.
\[18]And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the men who bore the tribute.
\[19]But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand to thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all who stood by him went out from him.
\[20]And Ehud came to him. And he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. And Ehud said, I have a message from God to thee. And he arose out of his seat.
\[21]And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body.
\[22]And the handle also went in after the blade, and the fat closed upon the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his body, and it came out behind.
\[23]Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room upon him, and locked them.
\[24]Now when he was gone out, his servants came, and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked. And they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber.
\[25]And they delayed till they were ashamed, and, behold, he did not open the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key, and opened, and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.
\[26]And Ehud escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirah.
\[27]And it came to pass, when he came, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim. And the sons of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them.
\[28]And he said to them, Follow after me, for Jehovah has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and did not allow a man to pass over.
\[29]And they smote about ten thousand men of Moab at that time, every robust man, and every man of valor, and there escaped not a man.
\[30]So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.
\[31]And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox-goad, and he also saved Israel.

nd the sons of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, when Ehud was dead.
\[2]And Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan who reigned in Hazor, the captain of whose army was Sisera who dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
\[3]And the sons of Israel cried to Jehovah, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and he mightily oppressed the sons of Israel twenty years.
\[4]Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
\[5]And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill-country of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel came up to her for judgment.
\[6]And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, Has not Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded, saying, Go and approach to mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zebulun?
\[7]And I will draw Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, to thee, to the river Kishon, with his chariots and his multitude, and I will deliver him into thy hand.
\[8]And Barak said to her, If thou will go with me, then I will go, but if thou will not go with me, I will not go.
\[9]And she said, I will surely go with thee. Notwithstanding, the journey that thou take shall not be for thine honor, for Jehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
\[10]And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh. And there went up ten thousand men at his feet, and Deborah went up with him.
\[11]Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the sons of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.
\[12]And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.
\[13]And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.
\[14]And Deborah said to Barak, Up, for this is the day in which Jehovah has delivered Sisera into thy hand. Has not Jehovah gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
\[15]And Jehovah discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak. And Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.
\[16]But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army, to Harosheth of the Gentiles. And all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword. There was not a man left.
\[17]However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
\[18]And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And he turned in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.
\[19]And he said to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
\[20]And he said to her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man comes and inquires of thee, and says, Is there any man here? that thou shall say, No.
\[21]Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground, for he was in a deep sleep, so he fainted and died.
\[22]And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seek. And he came to her, and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples.
\[23]So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the sons of Israel.
\[24]And the hand of the sons of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

hen Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,
\[2]That the leaders took the lead in Israel, that the people offered themselves willingly, bless ye Jehovah.
\[3]Hear, O ye kings. Give ear, O ye rulers. I, even I, will sing to Jehovah. I will sing praise to Jehovah, the God of Israel.
\[4]Jehovah, when thou went forth out of Seir, when thou marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the heavens also dropped, yea, the clouds dropped water.
\[5]The mountains quaked at the presence of Jehovah, even yon Sinai at the presence of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
\[6]In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.
\[7]The rulers ceased in Israel, they ceased, until that I, Deborah, arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.
\[8]They chose new gods, then war was in the gates. Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
\[9]My heart is toward the governors of Israel, who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye Jehovah.
\[10]Tell, ye who ride on white donkeys, ye who sit on rich carpets, and ye who walk by the way.
\[11]Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water, there they shall rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah, the righteous acts of his rule in Israel. Then the people of Jehovah went down to the gates.
\[12]Awake, awake, Deborah, awake, awake, utter a song. Arise, Barak, and lead away thy captives, thou son of Abinoam.
\[13]Then a remnant of the nobles and the people came down. Jehovah came down for me against the mighty.
\[14]Out of Ephraim, those whose root is in Amalek, after thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples, out of Machir, came down governors, and out of Zebulun those who handle the marshal's staff.
\[15]And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah, as was Issachar, so was Barak, into the valley they rushed forth at his feet. By the watercourses of Reuben there were great resolves of heart.
\[16]Why did thou sit among the sheepfolds, to hear the pipings for the flocks? At the watercourses of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.
\[17]Gilead abode beyond the Jordan. And Dan, why did he remain in ships? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, and abode by his creeks.
\[18]Zebulun was a people who jeopardized their lives to the death, and Naphtali, upon the high places of the field.
\[19]The kings came and fought. Then the kings of Canaan fought in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo. They took no gain of money.
\[20]From heaven the stars fought; from their courses they fought against Sisera.
\[21]The river Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, march on with strength.
\[22]Then the horse hoofs stamped by reason of the prancings, the prancings of their strong ones.
\[23]Curse ye Meroz, said the agent of Jehovah. Curse ye bitterly the inhabitants of it, because they did not come to the help of Jehovah, to the help of Jehovah against the mighty.
\[24]Blessed above women shall Jael be, the wife of Heber the Kenite. Blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
\[25]He asked water. She gave him milk. She brought him butter in a lordly dish.
\[26]She put her hand to the tent-pin, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer. And with the hammer she smote Sisera; she struck through his head. Yea, she pierced and struck through his temples.
\[27]At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay. At her feet he bowed, he fell. Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
\[28]Through the window she looked forth, and cried-the mother of Sisera through the lattice-Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why do the wheels of his chariots delay?
\[29]Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,
\[30]Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil? A damsel, two damsels to every man, to Sisera a spoil of dyed garments, a spoil of dyed garments embroidered, of dyed garments embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?
\[31]So let all thine enemies perish, O Jehovah, but let those who love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.

nd the sons of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
\[2]And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. And because of Midian the sons of Israel made for themselves the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
\[3]And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the sons of the east, they came up against them.
\[4]And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come to Gaza, and left no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor donkey.
\[5]For they came up with their cattle and their tents. They came in as locusts for multitude. Both they and their camels were without number, and they came into the land to destroy it.
\[6]And Israel was brought very low because of Midian, and the sons of Israel cried to Jehovah.
\[7]And it came to pass, when the sons of Israel cried to Jehovah because of Midian,
\[8]that Jehovah sent a prophet to the sons of Israel. And he said to them, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage.
\[9]And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land.
\[10]And I said to you, I am Jehovah your God. Ye shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell, but ye have not hearkened to my voice.
\[11]And the agent of Jehovah came, and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite. And his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.
\[12]And the agent of Jehovah appeared to him, and said to him, Jehovah is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.
\[13]And Gideon said to him, Oh, my lord, if Jehovah is with us, then why has all this befallen us? And where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not Jehovah bring us up from Egypt? But now Jehovah has cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.
\[14]And Jehovah looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian. Have I not sent thee?
\[15]And he said to him, Oh, Lord, with what shall I save Israel? Behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.
\[16]And Jehovah said to him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shall smite the Midianites as one man.
\[17]And he said to him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, then show me a sign that it is thou who talk with me.
\[18]Depart not from here, I pray thee, until I come to thee, and bring forth my present, and lay it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.
\[19]And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal. He put the flesh in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it.
\[20]And the agent of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.
\[21]Then the agent of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And the agent of Jehovah departed out of his sight.
\[22]And Gideon saw that he was the agent of Jehovah. And Gideon said, Alas, O lord Jehovah! Inasmuch as I have seen the agent of Jehovah face to face.
\[23]And Jehovah said to him, Peace be to thee. Fear not; thou shall not die.
\[24]Then Gideon built an altar there to Jehovah, and called it Jehovah-shalom. To this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
\[25]And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said to him, Take thy father's bullock, even the second bullock seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father has, and cut down the Asherah that is by it.
\[26]And build an altar to Jehovah thy God upon the top of this stronghold, in the orderly manner, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which thou shall cut down.
\[27]Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as Jehovah had spoken to him. And it came to pass, because he feared his father's household and the men of the city, so that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.
\[28]And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.
\[29]And they said one to another, Who has done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.
\[30]Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it.
\[31]And Joash said to all who stood against him, Will ye contend for Baal? Or will ye save him? He who will contend for him, let him be put to death while it is morning. If he be a god, let him contend for himself because he has broken down his altar.
\[32]Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him because he has broken down his altar.
\[33]Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the sons of the east assembled themselves together. And they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.
\[34]But the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, and Abiezer was gathered together after him.
\[35]And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they also were gathered together after him. And he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali, and they came up to meet them.
\[36]And Gideon said to God, If thou will save Israel by my hand, as thou have spoken,
\[37]behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor. If there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then I shall know that thou will save Israel by my hand as thou have spoken.
\[38]And it was so, for he rose up early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water.
\[39]And Gideon said to God, Let not thine anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once. Let me make trial, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece. Let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
\[40]And God did so that night, for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.

hen Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people who were with him, rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Harod. And the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
\[2]And Jehovah said to Gideon, The people who are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand has saved me.
\[3]Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty-two thousand, and there remained ten thousand.
\[4]And Jehovah said to Gideon, The people are yet too many. Bring them down to the water, and I will try them for thee there. And it shall be, that of whom I say to thee, This man shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee, and of whomever I say to thee, This man shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
\[5]So he brought down the people to the water. And Jehovah said to Gideon, Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, him thou shall set by himself. Likewise everyone who bows down upon his knees to drink.
\[6]And the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men, but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.
\[7]And Jehovah said to Gideon, By the three hundred men who lapped I will save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand. And let all the people go every man to his place.
\[8]So the people took provision in their hand, and their trumpets. And he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men. And the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
\[9]And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said to him, Arise, get thee down into the camp, for I have delivered it into thy hand.
\[10]But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Purah thy servant down to the camp.
\[11]And thou shall hear what they say, and afterward thy hands shall be strengthened to go down into the camp. Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp.
\[12]And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the sons of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude, and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea-shore for multitude.
\[13]And when Gideon came, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his fellow. And he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream. And, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and smote it so that it fell, and turned it upside down so that the tent lay flat.
\[14]And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else except the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. Into his hand God has delivered Midian, and all the army.
\[15]And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation of it, that he worshiped. And he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise, for Jehovah has delivered the army of Midian into your hand.
\[16]And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put trumpets into the hands of all of them, and empty pitchers, with torches inside the pitchers.
\[17]And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise, and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so ye shall do.
\[18]When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For Jehovah and for Gideon.
\[19]So Gideon, and the hundred men who were with him, came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch when they had but newly set the watch. And they blew the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.
\[20]And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow. And they cried out, The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon.
\[21]And they stood every man in his place round about the camp. And all the army ran, and they shouted, and put them to flight.
\[22]And they blew the three hundred trumpets, and Jehovah set every man's sword against his fellow, and against all the army. And the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.
\[23]And the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.
\[24]And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan. So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan.
\[25]And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. And they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian. And they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.

nd the men of Ephraim said to him, Why have thou done thus to us, that thou did not call us when thou went to fight with Midian? And they chided with him sharply.
\[2]And he said to them, What have I now done in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
\[3]God has delivered into your hand the rulers of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and what was I able to do in comparison with you? Then their anger was abated toward him when he had said that.
\[4]And Gideon came to the Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men who were with him, faint, yet pursuing.
\[5]And he said to the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.
\[6]And the rulers of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand that we should give bread to thine army?
\[7]And Gideon said, Therefore when Jehovah has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.
\[8]And he went up from there to Penuel, and spoke to them in like manner, and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.
\[9]And he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.
\[10]Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the army of the sons of the east, for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men who drew a sword.
\[11]And Gideon went up by the way of those who dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the army, for the army was confident.
\[12]And Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued after them. And he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the army.
\[13]And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.
\[14]And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him. And he described for him the rulers of Succoth, and the elders of it, seventy-seven men.
\[15]And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom ye taunted me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy men who are weary?
\[16]And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
\[17]And he broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.
\[18]Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye killed at Tabor? And they answered, As thou are, so were they. Each one resembled the sons of a king.
\[19]And he said, They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As Jehovah lives, if ye had saved them alive, I would not kill you.
\[20]And he said to Jether his firstborn, Up, and kill them. But the youth did not draw his sword, for he feared because he was yet a youth.
\[21]Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us, for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels' necks.
\[22]Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also, for thou have saved us out of the hand of Midian.
\[23]And Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you. Jehovah shall rule over you.
\[24]And Gideon said to them, I would make a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his spoil. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
\[25]And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and cast in it every man the earrings of his spoil.
\[26]And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold, besides the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels' necks.
\[27]And Gideon made an ephod of it, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah. And all Israel played the harlot after it there, and it became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.
\[28]So Midian was subdued before the sons of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.
\[29]And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
\[30]And Gideon had seventy sons begotten from his body, for he had many wives.
\[31]And his concubine who was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, and he called his name Abimelech.
\[32]And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulcher of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
\[33]And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the sons of Israel turned again, and played the harlot after the Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.
\[34]And the sons of Israel did not remember Jehovah their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side,
\[35]neither did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel.

\[2]Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Which is better for you, that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are seventy men, rule over you, or that one rule over you? Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.
\[3]And his mother's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words. And their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, He is our brother.
\[4]And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and unstable fellows who followed him.
\[5]And he went to his father's house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy men, upon one stone, but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself.
\[6]And all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.
\[7]And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried out, and said to them, Hearken to me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken to you.
\[8]The trees went forth a time to anoint a king over them. And they said to the olive tree, Reign thou over us.
\[9]But the olive tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness with which by me they honor God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?
\[10]And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.
\[11]But the fig tree said to them, Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?
\[12]And the trees said to the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.
\[13]And the vine said to them, Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?
\[14]Then all the trees said to the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.
\[15]And the bramble said to the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade, and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
\[16]Now therefore, if ye have dealt truly and uprightly, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deed of his hands
\[17](for my father fought for you, and ventured his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian,
\[18]and ye have risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy men, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid-servant, king over the men of Shechem because he is your brother),
\[19]if ye then have dealt truly and uprightly with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you.
\[20]But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo, and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.
\[21]And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
\[22]And Abimelech was ruler over Israel three years.
\[23]And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem, and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,
\[24]that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid upon Abimelech their brother who killed them, and upon the men of Shechem who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.
\[25]And the men of Shechem set ambushes for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who came along that way by them, and it was told Abimelech.
\[26]And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers, and went over to Shechem, and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.
\[27]And they went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.
\[28]And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is not he the son of Jerubbaal, and Zebul his officer? Serve ye the men of Hamor the father of Shechem, but why should we serve him?
\[29]And would that this people were under my hand! Then I would remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.
\[30]And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
\[31]And he sent messengers to Abimelech privately, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem, and, behold, they are fortifying the city against thee.
\[32]Now therefore, up by night, thou and the people who are with thee, and lie in wait in the field.
\[33]And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shall rise early, and rush upon the city, and, behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against thee, then thou may do to them as thou shall find occasion.
\[34]And Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
\[35]And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city. And Abimelech rose up, and the people who were with him, from the ambushment.
\[36]And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there comes a people down from the tops of the mountains. And Zebul said to him, Thou see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.
\[37]And Gaal spoke again and said, See, there comes a people down by the middle of the land, and one company comes by the way of the oak of Meonenim.
\[38]Then Zebul said to him, Where is now thy mouth, that thou said, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? Is not this the people that thou have despised? Go out now, I pray, and fight with them.
\[39]And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
\[40]And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.
\[41]And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
\[42]And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field, and they told Abimelech.
\[43]And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field. And he looked, and, behold, the people came forth out of the city. And he rose up against them, and smote them.
\[44]And Abimelech, and the companies who were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city, and the two companies rushed upon all who were in the field, and smote them.
\[45]And Abimelech fought against the city all that day. And he took the city, and killed the people that were in it, and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
\[46]And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the house of El-berith.
\[47]And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
\[48]And Abimelech got up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him. And Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder. And he said to the people who were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.
\[49]And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire upon them, so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
\[50]Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
\[51]But there was a strong tower inside the city. And all the men and women fled, and all those of the city, and shut themselves in, and got up to the roof of the tower.
\[52]And Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
\[53]And a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon Abimelech's head, and broke his skull.
\[54]Then he called hastily to the young man his armor bearer, and said to him, Draw thy sword, and kill me, that men not say of me, A woman killed him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
\[55]And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.
\[56]Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in slaying his seventy brothers.
\[57]And God requited all the wickedness of the men of Shechem upon their heads. And the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal came upon them.

\[2]And he judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
\[3]And after him arose Jair, the Gileadite, and he judged Israel twenty-two years.
\[4]And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth-jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
\[5]And Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.
\[6]And the sons of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baalim, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the sons of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines. And they forsook Jehovah, and did not serve him.
\[7]And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the sons of Ammon.
\[8]And they vexed and oppressed the sons of Israel that year. Eighteen years they oppressed all the sons of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
\[9]And the sons of Ammon passed over the Jordan to also fight against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was exceedingly distressed.
\[10]And the sons of Israel cried to Jehovah, saying, We have sinned against thee, even because we have forsaken our God, and have served the Baalim.
\[11]And Jehovah said to the sons of Israel, Did not I save you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the sons of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
\[12]The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, oppressed you. And ye cried to me, and I saved you out of their hand.
\[13]Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods. Therefore I will save you no more.
\[14]Go and cry to the gods which ye have chosen. Let them save you in the time of your distress.
\[15]And the sons of Israel said to Jehovah, We have sinned. Do thou to us whatever seems good to thee, only deliver us, we pray thee, this day.
\[16]And they put away the foreign gods from among them, and served Jehovah. And his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
\[17]Then the sons of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the sons of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah.
\[18]And the people, the rulers of Gilead, said one to another, What man is he who will begin to fight against the sons of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

ow Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a harlot, and Gilead begot Jephthah.
\[2]And Gilead's wife bore sons to him. And when his wife's sons grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said to him, Thou shall not inherit in our father's house, for thou are the son of another woman.
\[3]Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and dwelt in the land of Tob. And vain fellows were gathered to Jephthah, and they went out with him.
\[4]And it came to pass after a while, that the sons of Ammon made war against Israel.
\[5]And it was so, that, when the sons of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob.
\[6]And they said to Jephthah, Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the sons of Ammon.
\[7]And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Did ye not hate me, and drive me out of my father's house? And why have ye come to me now when ye are in distress?
\[8]And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, For that reason we turned again to thee now, that thou may go with us, and fight with the sons of Ammon. And thou shall be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
\[9]And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight with the sons of Ammon, and Jehovah delivers them before me, shall I be your head?
\[10]And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Jehovah shall be witness between us. Surely according to thy word so will we do.
\[11]Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them. And Jephthah spoke all his words before Jehovah in Mizpah.
\[12]And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the sons of Ammon, saying, What have thou to do with me, that thou have come to me to fight against my land?
\[13]And the king of the sons of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan. Now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.
\[14]And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the sons of Ammon.
\[15]And he said to him, Thus says Jephthah: Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the sons of Ammon,
\[16]but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh,
\[17]then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land, but the king of Edom did not hearken. And in like manner he sent to the king of Moab, but he would not. And Israel abode in Kadesh.
\[18]Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab. And they encamped on the other side of the Arnon, but they did not come within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
\[19]And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon. And Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land to my place.
\[20]But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his border, but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
\[21]And Jehovah, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them. So Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
\[22]And they possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan.
\[23]So now Jehovah, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should thou possess them?
\[24]Will thou not possess that which Chemosh thy god gives thee to possess? So whomever Jehovah our God has dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.
\[25]And now are thou anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?
\[26]While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years, why did ye not recover them within that time?
\[27]I therefore have not sinned against thee, but thou do me wrong to war against me. Jehovah, the Judge, be judge this day between the sons of Israel and the sons of Ammon.
\[28]However the king of the sons of Ammon did not hearken to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
\[29]Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the sons of Ammon.
\[30]And Jephthah vowed a vow to Jehovah, and said, If thou will indeed deliver the sons of Ammon into my hand,
\[31]then it shall be, that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the sons of Ammon, it shall be Jehovah's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.
\[32]So Jephthah passed over to the sons of Ammon to fight against them, and Jehovah delivered them into his hand.
\[33]And he smote them from Aroer until thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the sons of Ammon were subdued before the sons of Israel.
\[34]And Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances. And she was his only child. Besides her he had neither son nor daughter.
\[35]And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! Thou have brought me very low, and thou are one of those who trouble me, for I have opened my mouth to Jehovah, and I cannot go back.
\[36]And she said to him, My father, thou have opened thy mouth to Jehovah. Do to me according to that which has proceeded out of thy mouth, inasmuch as Jehovah has taken vengeance for thee on thine enemies, even on the sons of Ammon.
\[37]And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: Let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.
\[38]And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months. And she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
\[39]And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed, and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,
\[40]that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.

nd the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward. And they said to Jephthah, Why did thou pass over to fight against the sons of Ammon, and did not call us to go with thee? We will burn thy house upon thee with fire.
\[2]And Jephthah said to them, I and my people were at great strife with the sons of Ammon, and when I called you, ye did not save me out of their hand.
\[3]And when I saw that ye did not save me, I put my life in my hand, and passed opposite the sons of Ammon, and Jehovah delivered them into my hand. Why then have ye come up to me this day, to fight against me?
\[4]Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim. And the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye are fugitives of Ephraim, ye Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, and in the midst of Manasseh.
\[5]And the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. And it was so, that, when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, Let me go over, the men of Gilead said to him, Are thou an Ephraimite? If he said, No,
\[6]then they said to him, Say now Shibboleth, and he said Sibboleth, for he could not frame to pronounce it right, then they laid hold on him, and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. And there fell at that time of Ephraim forty-two thousand.

\[2]And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah, and his wife was barren, and did not bear.
\[3]And the agent of Jehovah appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold now, thou are barren, and do not bear, but thou shall conceive, and bear a son.
\[4]Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing,
\[5]for, lo, thou shall conceive, and bear a son. And no razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb. And he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
\[6]Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the agent of God, very awesome. And I did not ask him from where he was, neither did he tell me his name,
\[7]but he said to me, Behold, thou shall conceive, and bear a son. And now drink no wine nor strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.
\[8]Then Manoah entreated Jehovah, and said, Oh, Lord, I pray thee, let the man of God whom thou sent come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child that shall be born.
\[9]And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah, and the agent of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her.
\[10]And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said to him, Behold, the man has appeared to me, who came to me the other day.
\[11]And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Are thou the man who spoke to the woman? And he said, I am.
\[12]And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. What shall be the ordering of the child, and what shall we do to him?
\[13]And the agent of Jehovah said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.
\[14]She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing. All that I commanded her let her observe.
\[15]And Manoah said to the agent of Jehovah, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.
\[16]And the agent of Jehovah said to Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread, and if thou will make ready a burnt offering, thou must offer it to Jehovah. For Manoah did not know that he was the agent of Jehovah.
\[17]And Manoah said to the agent of Jehovah, What is thy name, that, when thy words come to pass, we may do thee honor?
\[18]And the agent of Jehovah said to him, Why do thou ask after my name, seeing it is wonderful?
\[19]So Manoah took the kid with the meal offering, and offered it upon the rock to Jehovah. And the agent did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on,
\[20]for it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the agent of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on, and they fell on their faces to the ground.
\[21]But the agent of Jehovah appeared no more to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the agent of Jehovah.
\[22]And Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
\[23]But his wife said to him, If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand, neither would he have shown us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.
\[24]And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him.

\[3]Then his father and his mother said to him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brothers, or among all my people, that thou go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said to his father, Get her for me, for she pleases me well.
\[4]But his father and his mother knew not that it was of Jehovah, for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.
\[5]Then Samson went down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah. And, behold, a young lion roared against him.
\[6]And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and he tore him apart as he would have torn a kid, and he had nothing in his hand. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.
\[7]And he went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.
\[8]And after a while he returned to take her. And he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
\[9]And he took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went. And he came to his father and mother, and gave to them, and they ate, but he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.
\[10]And his father went down to the woman, and Samson made a feast there, for so the young men used to do.
\[11]And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
\[12]And Samson said to them, Let me now put forth a riddle to you. If ye can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment,
\[13]but if ye cannot declare it to me, then ye shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment. And they said to him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.
\[14]And he said to them, Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days declare the riddle.
\[15]And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire. Have ye called us to impoverish us? Is it not so?
\[16]And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou do but hate me, and not love me. Thou have put forth a riddle to the sons of my people, and have not told it to me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not told it to my father nor my mother, and shall I tell thee?
\[17]And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted. And it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her because she pressed him greatly. And she told the riddle to the sons of her people.
\[18]And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said to them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye would not have found out my riddle.
\[19]And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and smote thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes of raiment to those who declared the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.

\[2]And her father said, I truly thought that thou had utterly hated her, therefore I gave her to thy companion. Is not her younger sister fairer than she? Take her, I pray thee, instead of her.
\[3]And Samson said to them, This time I shall be blameless in regard of the Philistines when I do them a mischief.
\[4]And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between every two tails.
\[5]And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the oliveyards.
\[6]Then the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they said, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.

\[10]And the men of Judah said, Why have ye come up against us? And they said, We come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.
\[11]Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Know thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that thou have done to us? And he said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.
\[12]And they said to him, We have come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.
\[13]And they spoke to him, saying, No, but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand, but truly we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.
\[14]When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him. And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands.
\[15]And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put forth his hand, and took it, and smote a thousand men with it.
\[16]And Samson said, With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey I have smitten a thousand men.
\[17]And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand. And that place was called Ramath-lehi.
\[18]And he was very thirsty, and called on Jehovah, and said, Thou have given this great deliverance by the hand of thy servant, and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?
\[19]But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out there. And when he had drunk his spirit came again, and he revived. Therefore the name of it was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.

\[9]Now she had an ambush abiding in the inner chamber. And she said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he broke the withes, as a string of tow is broken when it touches the fire. So his strength was not known.
\[10]And Delilah said to Samson, Behold, thou have mocked me, and told me lies. Now tell me, I pray thee, with what thou might be bound.
\[11]And he said to her, If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done, then I shall become weak, and be as another man.
\[12]So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him with it, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And the ambushment was abiding in the inner chamber. And he broke them off his arms like a thread.
\[13]And Delilah said to Samson, Until now thou have mocked me, and told me lies. Tell me with what thou might be bound. And he said to her, If thou weave the seven locks of my head with the web.
\[14]And she fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web.
\[15]And she said to him, How can thou say, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? Thou have mocked me these three times, and have not told me with what thy great strength lies.
\[16]And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was vexed to death.
\[17]And he told her all his heart, and said to her, There has not come a razor upon my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother's womb. If I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
\[18]And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he has told me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought the money in their hand.
\[19]And she made him sleep upon her knees, and she called for a man, and shaved off the seven locks of his head. And she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
\[20]And she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free, but he knew not that Jehovah was departed from him.
\[21]And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes. And they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass, and he did grinding in the prison-house.
\[22]However the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.
\[23]And the lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice, for they said, Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.
\[24]And when the people saw him, they praised their god, for they said, Our god has delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer of our country who has slain many of us.
\[25]And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make sport to us. And they called for Samson out of the prison-house, and he made sport before them. And they set him between the pillars.
\[26]And Samson said to the lad who held him by the hand, Allow me that I may feel the pillars upon which the house rests, that I may lean upon them.
\[27]Now the house was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were there. And there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, who beheld while Samson made sport.
\[28]And Samson called to Jehovah, and said, O lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.
\[29]And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and leaned upon them, the one with his right hand, and the other with his left.
\[30]And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might, and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were in it. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than those that he killed in his life.
\[31]Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.

nd there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
\[2]And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me. I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be my son from Jehovah.
\[3]And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother. And his mother said, I verily dedicate the silver to Jehovah from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten image. Now therefore I will restore it to thee.
\[4]And when he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made of it a graven image and a molten image. And it was in the house of Micah.
\[5]And the man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
\[6]In those days there was no king in Israel. Every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
\[7]And there was a young man out of Bethlehem-judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
\[8]And the man departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find a place. And he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
\[9]And Micah said to him, From where come thou? And he said to him, I am a Levite of Bethlehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.
\[10]And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten pieces of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy food. So the Levite went in.
\[11]And the Levite was content to dwell with the man, and the young man was to him as one of his sons.
\[12]And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
\[13]Then Micah said, Now I know that Jehovah will do me good, seeing I have a Levite for my priest.

n those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites sought for them an inheritance to dwell in, for to that day their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.
\[2]And the sons of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it. And they said to them, Go, search the land. And they came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, and lodged there.
\[3]When they were by the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young man the Levite. And they turned aside there, and said to him, Who brought thee here? And what are thou doing in this place? And what have thou here?
\[4]And he said to them, Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me, and he has hired me, and I have become his priest.
\[5]And they said to him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
\[6]And the priest said to them, Go in peace. Your way is before Jehovah in which ye go.
\[7]Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were in it, how they dwelt in security, according to the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure, for there was none in the land possessing authority, that might put them to shame in anything. And they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with any man.
\[8]And they came to their brothers to Zorah and Eshtaol. And their brothers said to them, What say ye?
\[9]And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good, and are ye idle? Be not slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.
\[10]When ye go, ye shall come to a people secure. And the land is large, for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no want of anything that is on the earth.
\[11]And there set forth from there of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girded with weapons of war.
\[12]And they went up, and encamped in Kiriath-jearim, in Judah. Therefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan, to this day. Behold, it is behind Kiriath-jearim.
\[13]And they passed from there to the hill-country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
\[14]Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish, answered and said to their brothers, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? Now therefore consider what ye have to do.
\[15]And they turned aside there, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare.
\[16]And the six hundred men girded with their weapons of war, who were of the sons of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.
\[17]And the five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. And the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girded with weapons of war.
\[18]And when these went into Micah's house, and fetched the graven image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, What do ye?
\[19]And they said to him, Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for thee to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?
\[20]And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.
\[21]So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them.
\[22]When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the sons of Dan.
\[23]And they cried out to the sons of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said to Micah, What troubles thee that thou come with such a company?
\[24]And he said, ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away, and what have I more? And how do ye then say to me, What troubles thee?
\[25]And the sons of Dan said to him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.
\[26]And the sons of Dan went their way. And when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.
\[27]And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and they burnt the city with fire.
\[28]And there was no deliverer because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any man, and it was in the valley that lies by Beth-rehob. And they built the city, and dwelt in it.
\[29]And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father who was born to Israel. However the name of the city was Laish at first.
\[30]And the sons of Dan set up for themselves the graven image. And Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.
\[31]So they set up for them Micah's graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

nd it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehem-judah.
\[2]And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him to her father's house to Bethlehem-judah, and was there the space of four months.
\[3]And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her, to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of donkeys. And she brought him into her father's house, and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
\[4]And his father-in-law, the damsel's father, retained him, and he abode with him three days. So they ate and drank, and lodged there.
\[5]And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart. And the damsel's father said to his son-in-law, Strengthen thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way.
\[6]So they sat down, and ate and drank, both of them together. And the damsel's father said to the man, Be pleased, I pray thee, to tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.
\[7]And the man rose up to depart, but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again.
\[8]And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart. And the damsel's father said, Strengthen thy heart, I pray thee, and tarry ye until the day declines. And they ate, both of them.
\[9]And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said to him, Behold, now the day draws toward evening, I pray you tarry all night. Behold, the day grows to an end, lodge here that thy heart may be merry, and tomorrow get early on your way that thou may go home.
\[10]But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came opposite Jebus (the same is Jerusalem). And there were with him a couple of saddled donkeys. His concubine was also with him.
\[11]When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent, and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
\[12]And his master said to him, We will not turn aside into the city of a foreigner that is not of the sons of Israel, but we will pass over to Gibeah.
\[13]And he said to his servant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places, and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
\[14]So they passed on and went their way. And the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.
\[15]And they turned aside there, to go in to lodge in Gibeah. And he went in, and sat down in the street of the city, for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge.
\[16]And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening. Now the man was of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah, but the men of the place were Benjamites.
\[17]And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city. And the old man said, Where do thou go? And from where do thou come?
\[18]And he said to him, We are passing from Bethlehem-judah to the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim. I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem-judah. And I am now going to the house of Jehovah, and there is no man that takes me into his house.
\[19]Yet there is both straw and provender for our donkeys, and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man who is with thy servants. There is no want of anything.
\[20]And the old man said, Peace be to thee. However let all thy wants lie upon me, only do not lodge in the street.
\[21]So he brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder. And they washed their feet, and ate and drank.
\[22]As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door. And they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man who came into thy house, that we may know him.
\[23]And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, No, my brothers, I pray you, do not so wickedly, seeing that this man has come into my house. Do not this folly.
\[24]Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine. I will bring them out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seems good to you, but to this man do not any such folly.
\[25]But the men would not hearken to him. So the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth to them. And they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning, and when the day began to spring, they let her go.
\[26]Then the woman came in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.
\[27]And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way, and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold.
\[28]And he said to her, Up, and let us be going, but there was no answering. Then he took her up upon the donkey, and the man rose up, and got to his place.
\[29]And when he came into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.
\[30]And it was so, that all who saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the sons of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day. Consider it, take counsel, and speak.

hen all the sons of Israel went out. And the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to Jehovah at Mizpah.
\[2]And the chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen who drew a sword.
\[3](Now the sons of Benjamin heard that the sons of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the sons of Israel said, Tell us, how was this wickedness brought to pass?
\[4]And the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
\[5]And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about me by night. They thought to have me slain, and they forced my concubine, and she is dead.
\[6]And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel, for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
\[7]Behold, ye sons of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and counsel.
\[8]And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn to his house.
\[9]But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: We will go up against it by lot,
\[10]and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch provision for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.
\[11]So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
\[12]And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that has come to pass among you?
\[13]Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows, who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brothers the sons of Israel.
\[14]And the sons of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the sons of Israel.
\[15]And the sons of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty-six thousand men who drew a sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
\[16]Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left-handed. Every one could sling stones at a hair-breadth, and not miss.
\[17]And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men who drew a sword. All these were men of war.
\[18]And the sons of Israel arose, and went up to Bethel, and asked counsel of God. And they said, Who shall go up for us first to battle against the sons of Benjamin? And Jehovah said, Judah first.
\[19]And the sons of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.
\[20]And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin. And the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.
\[21]And the sons of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty-two thousand men.
\[22]And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day.
\[23]And the sons of Israel went up and wept before Jehovah until evening. And they asked of Jehovah, saying, Shall I again draw near to battle against the sons of Benjamin my brother? And Jehovah said, Go up against him.
\[24]And the sons of Israel came near against the sons of Benjamin the second day.
\[25]And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the sons of Israel again eighteen thousand men. All these drew the sword.
\[26]Then all the sons of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to Bethel, and wept, and sat there before Jehovah, and fasted that day until evening, and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Jehovah.
\[27]And the sons of Israel asked of Jehovah (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
\[28]and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the sons of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And Jehovah said, Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver him into thy hand.
\[29]And Israel set an ambushment against Gibeah round about.
\[30]And the sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
\[31]And the sons of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city. And they began to smite and kill of the people as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to Bethel, and the other to Gibeah, in the field about thirty men of Israel.
\[32]And the sons of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us as at the first. But the sons of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways.
\[33]And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar, and the ambushment of Israel broke forth out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba.
\[34]And there came opposite Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was severe, but they knew not that evil was close upon them.
\[35]And Jehovah smote Benjamin before Israel, and the sons of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand and a hundred men. All these drew the sword.
\[36]So the sons of Benjamin saw that they were smitten, for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin because they trusted to the ambushment whom they had set against Gibeah.
\[37]And the ambushment hastened, and rushed upon Gibeah. And the ambushment drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.
\[38]Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushment was, that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.
\[39]And the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons, for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us as in the first battle.
\[40]But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven.
\[41]And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed, for they saw that evil had come upon them.
\[42]Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness. But the battle followed hard after them, and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst of it.
\[43]They enclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trod them down at their resting-place, as far as opposite Gibeah toward the sunrise.
\[44]And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men. All these were men of valor.
\[45]And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. And they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and smote of them two thousand men.
\[46]So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword. All these were men of valor.
\[47]But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months.
\[48]And the men of Israel turned again upon the sons of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the cattle, and all that they found. Moreover they set on fire all the cities which they found.

ow the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin to wife.
\[2]And the people came to Bethel, and sat there till evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept bitterly.
\[3]And they said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, why has this come to pass in Israel, that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel?
\[4]And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
\[5]And the sons of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that did not come up in the assembly to Jehovah? For they had made a great oath concerning him who did not come up to Jehovah to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death.
\[6]And the sons of Israel regretted for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
\[7]What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since we have sworn by Jehovah that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?
\[8]And they said, Which one is there of the tribes of Israel that did not come up to Jehovah to Mizpah? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.
\[9]For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.
\[10]And the congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.
\[11]And this is the thing that ye shall do: Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that has lain by man.
\[12]And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known man by lying with him, and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
\[13]And the whole congregation sent and spoke to the sons of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.
\[14]And Benjamin returned at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead. And even so they were not sufficient for them.
\[15]And the people regretted for Benjamin, because Jehovah had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
\[16]Then the elders of the congregation said, What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?
\[17]And they said, There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not blotted out from Israel.
\[18]However we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the sons of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed be he who gives a wife to Benjamin.
\[19]And they said, Behold, there is a feast of Jehovah from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
\[20]And they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,
\[21]and watch. And, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch for you every man his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
\[22]And it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them, Grant them graciously to us, because we took not for each man of them his wife in battle, neither did ye give them to them, else ye would now be guilty.
\[23]And the sons of Benjamin did so, and took for them wives, according to their number, of those who danced, whom they carried off. And they went and returned to their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them.
\[24]And the sons of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance.
\[25]In those days there was no king in Israel. Every man did that which was right in his own eyes.

\[6]Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Jehovah had visited his people in giving them bread.
\[7]And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her, and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.
\[8]And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother's house. Jehovah deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
\[9]Jehovah grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices, and wept.
\[10]And they said to her, No, but we will return with thee to thy people.
\[11]And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters. Why will ye go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
\[12]Turn again, my daughters. Go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope. If I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons,
\[13]would ye therefore delay till they were grown? Would ye therefore stay from having husbands? No, my daughters, for it grieves me much for your sakes, for the hand of Jehovah has gone forth against me.
\[14]And they lifted up their voices, and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.
\[15]And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law has gone back to her people, and to her god. Return thou after thy sister-in-law.
\[16]And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee, for where thou go, I will go, and where thou lodge, I will lodge. Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.
\[17]Where thou die, I will die, and there I will be buried. Jehovah do so to me, and more also, if anything but death parts thee and me.
\[18]And when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking to her.
\[19]So those two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they came to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and the women said, Is this Naomi?
\[20]And she said to them, Call me not Naomi. Call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
\[21]I went out full, and Jehovah has brought me home again empty. Why do ye call me Naomi, seeing Jehovah has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?
\[22]So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.

nd Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.
\[2]And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor. And she said to her, Go, my daughter.
\[3]And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And her chance was to land on the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
\[4]And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, Jehovah be with you. And they answered him, Jehovah bless thee.
\[5]Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?
\[6]And the servant who was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabite damsel who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab.
\[7]And she said, Let me glean, I pray you, and gather behind the reapers among the sheaves. So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she tarried a little in the house.
\[8]Then Boaz said to Ruth, Do thou not hear, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from here, but abide here close by my maidens.
\[9]Let thine eyes be on the field that they reap, and go thou after them. Have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? And when thou are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.
\[10]Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favor in thy sight that thou should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?
\[11]And Boaz answered and said to her, It has been fully shown me all that thou have done to thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband, and how thou have left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and have come to a people that thou knew not formerly.
\[12]Jehovah recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of Jehovah, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou have come to take refuge.
\[13]Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, because thou have comforted me, and because thou have spoken kindly to thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens.
\[14]And at mealtime Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain, and she ate, and was satisfied, and left of it.
\[15]And when she arose up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her.
\[16]And also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and do not rebuke her.
\[17]So she gleaned in the field until evening. And she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
\[18]And she took it up, and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. And she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was satisfied.
\[19]And her mother-in-law said to her, Where have thou gleaned today? And where have thou worked? Blessed be he who took knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz.
\[20]And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Jehovah who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said to her, The man is near of kin to us, one of our near kinsmen.
\[21]And Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he said to me, Thou shall keep close by my young men until they have ended all my harvest.
\[22]And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that they not meet thee in any other field.
\[23]So she kept close by the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest. And she dwelt with her mother-in-law.

\[2]And now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens thou were? Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing-floor.
\[3]Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing-floor. But do not make thyself known to the man until he shall have done eating and drinking.
\[4]And it shall be, when he lies down, that thou shall notice the place where he shall lie. And thou shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lie thee down. And he will tell thee what thou shall do.
\[5]And she said to her, All that thou say I will do.
\[6]And she went down to the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.
\[7]And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. And she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid down.
\[8]And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was startled, and turned himself, and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.
\[9]And he said, Who are thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thy handmaid. Spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid, for thou are a near kinsman.
\[10]And he said, Blessed be thou of Jehovah, my daughter. Thou have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou did not follow young men, whether poor or rich.
\[11]And now, my daughter, fear not. I will do to thee all that thou say, for all the city of my people know that thou are a worthy woman.
\[12]And now it is true that I am a near kinsman. However there is a kinsman nearer than I.
\[13]Remain this night, and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform to thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part. But if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then I will do the part of a kinsman to thee, as Jehovah lives. Lie down until the morning.
\[14]And she lay at his feet until the morning. And she rose up before one could discern another. For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.
\[15]And he said, Bring the mantle that is upon thee, and hold it. And she held it, and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her, and he went into the city.
\[16]And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who are thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.
\[17]And she said, He gave me these six measures of barley, for he said, Go not empty to thy mother-in-law.

ow Boaz went up to the gate, and sat down there. And, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by, to whom he said, Such man, stay, turn aside. Sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.
\[2]And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.
\[3]And he said to the near kinsman, Naomi, who has come again out of the country of Moab, sells the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's.
\[4]And I thought to disclose it to thee, saying, Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou will redeem it, redeem it, but if thou will not redeem it, then tell me that I may know, for there is none to redeem it besides thee, and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.
\[5]Then Boaz said, That day thou buy the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
\[6]And the near kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself lest I mar my own inheritance. Take thou my right of redemption on thee, for I cannot redeem it.
\[7]Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: A man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor. And this was the manner of attestation in Israel.
\[8]So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for thyself. And he drew off his shoe.
\[9]And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, from the hand of Naomi.
\[10]Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I have purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead not be cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place. Ye are witnesses this day.
\[11]And all the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Jehovah make the woman that has come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two built the house of Israel, and do thou worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem.
\[12]And let thy house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which Jehovah shall give thee by this young woman.
\[13]So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And he went in to her, and Jehovah gave her conception, and she bore a son.
\[14]And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be Jehovah, who has not left thee this day without a near kinsman. And let his name be famous in Israel.
\[15]And he shall be to thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age, for thy daughter-in-law, who loves thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, has borne him.
\[16]And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it.
\[17]And the women, her neighbors, gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi. And they called his name Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
\[18]Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begot Hezron,
\[19]and Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab,
\[20]and Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon,
\[21]and Salmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot Obed,

ow there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill-country of Ephraim. And his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
\[2]And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
\[3]And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Jehovah, were there.
\[4]And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions,
\[5]but to Hannah he gave a double portion, for he loved Hannah, but Jehovah had shut up her womb.
\[6]And her rival provoked her greatly, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb.
\[7]And as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of Jehovah, so she provoked her. Therefore she wept, and did not eat.
\[8]And Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why do thou weep? And why do thou not eat? And why is thy heart grieved? Am not I better to thee than ten sons?
\[9]So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah.
\[10]And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Jehovah, and wept much.
\[11]And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou will indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but will give to thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
\[12]And it came to pass, as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli noticed her mouth.
\[13]Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk.
\[14]And Eli said to her, How long will thou be drunken? Put away thy wine from thee.
\[15]And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Jehovah.
\[16]Count not thy handmaid for an iniquitous woman, for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken until now.
\[17]Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou have asked of him.
\[18]And she said, Let thy handmaid find favor in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and ate, and her countenance was no more sad.
\[19]And they rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before Jehovah, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and Jehovah remembered her.
\[20]And it came to pass, when the time came about, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son. And she called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of Jehovah.
\[21]And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Jehovah the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
\[22]But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, Not until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and abide there forever.
\[23]And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems good to thee. Remain until thou have weaned him, only Jehovah establish his word. So the woman remained and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.
\[24]And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of Jehovah in Shiloh, and the child was young.
\[25]And they killed the bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
\[26]And she said, Oh, my lord, as thy soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by thee here, praying to Jehovah.
\[27]I prayed for this child, and Jehovah has given me my petition which I asked of him.
\[28]Therefore also I have granted him to Jehovah; as long as he lives he is granted to Jehovah. And he worshiped Jehovah there.

nd Hannah prayed, and said, My heart exults in Jehovah. My horn is exalted in Jehovah. My mouth is enlarged over my enemies because I rejoice in thy salvation.
\[2]There is none holy as Jehovah, for there is none besides thee, neither is there any rock like our God.
\[3]Talk no more so very proudly. Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth, for Jehovah is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
\[4]The bows of the mighty men are broken, and those who stumbled are girded with strength.
\[5]Those who were full have hired out themselves for bread, and those who were hungry have ceased to hunger. Yea, the barren has borne seven, and she who has many sons languishes.
\[6]Jehovah kills, and makes alive. He brings down to Sheol, and brings up.
\[7]Jehovah makes poor, and makes rich. He brings low, he also lifts up.
\[8]He raises up the poor out of the dust, he lifts up the needy from the dunghill, to make them sit with rulers, and inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah's, and he has set the world upon them.
\[9]He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness, for by strength no man shall prevail.
\[10]Those who strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces. He will thunder against them in heaven. Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth, and he will give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.
\[11]And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house, and the child ministered to Jehovah before Eli the priest.
\[12]Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not Jehovah.
\[13]And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand,
\[14]and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot. All that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took with it. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.
\[15]And before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, for he will not have boiled flesh from thee, but raw.
\[16]And if the man said to him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as thy soul desires, then he would say, No, but thou shall give it to me now, and if not, I will take it by force.
\[17]And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah, for the men despised the offering of Jehovah.
\[18]But Samuel ministered before Jehovah, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.
\[19]Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
\[20]And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed by this woman for the petition which was asked of Jehovah. And they went to their own home.
\[21]And Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before Jehovah.
\[22]Now Eli was very old. And he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who assembled at the door of the tent of meeting.
\[23]And he said to them, Why do ye such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.
\[24]No, my sons, for it is no good report that I hear. Ye make Jehovah's people to transgress.
\[25]If one man sins against another, God shall judge him, but if a man sins against Jehovah, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they did not hearken to the voice of their father, because Jehovah intended to kill them.
\[26]And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Jehovah, and also with men.
\[27]And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Did I reveal myself to the house of thy father when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh's house?
\[28]And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? And did I give to the house of thy father all the offerings of the sons of Israel made by fire?
\[29]Why do ye kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chief of all the offerings of Israel my people?
\[30]Therefore Jehovah, the God of Israel, says, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me forever, but now Jehovah says, Be it far from me, for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
\[31]Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.
\[32]And thou shall see an enemy in my habitation, in all that I shall give Israel, and there shall not be an old man in thy house forever.
\[33]And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from my altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thy heart. And all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age.
\[34]And this shall be the sign to thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: In one day they shall die, both of them.
\[35]And I will raise up for me a faithful priest who shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. And I will build for him a sure house, and he shall walk before my anointed forever.
\[36]And it shall come to pass, that everyone who is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices that I may eat a morsel of bread.

\[2]And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim so that he could not see),
\[3]and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down in the temple of Jehovah where the ark of God was,
\[4]that Jehovah called Samuel. And he said, Here I am.
\[5]And he ran to Eli, and said, Here I am, for thou called me. And he said, I did not call. Lie down again. And he went and lay down.
\[6]And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here I am, for thou called me. And he answered, I did not call, my son. Lie down again.
\[7]Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed to him.
\[8]And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here I am, for thou called me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child.
\[9]Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down, and it shall be, if he calls thee, that thou shall say, Speak, Jehovah, for thy servant hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
\[10]And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak, for thy servant hears.
\[11]And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.
\[12]In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.
\[13]For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse upon themselves, and he did not restrain them.
\[14]And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering forever.
\[15]And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel was afraid to show Eli the vision.
\[16]Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here I am.
\[17]And he said, What is the thing that Jehovah has spoken to thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me. God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to thee.
\[18]And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah. Let him do what seems him good.
\[19]And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.
\[20]And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah.
\[21]And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh, for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.

nd the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
\[2]And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel. And when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men.
\[3]And when the people came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has Jehovah smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh to us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.
\[4]So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who sits above the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
\[5]And when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
\[6]And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What is the meaning of the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of Jehovah came into the camp.
\[7]And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God has come into the camp. And they said, Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing heretofore.
\[8]Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness.
\[9]Be strong, and strengthen yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Conduct yourselves like men, and fight.
\[10]And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent. And there was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
\[11]And the ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were killed.
\[12]And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn, and with dirt upon his head.
\[13]And when he came, lo, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the wayside watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.
\[14]And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What does the noise of this tumult mean? And the man hastened, and came and told Eli.
\[15]Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were dim so that he could not see.
\[16]And the man said to Eli, I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army. And he said, How did the matter go, my son?
\[17]And he who brought the news answered and said, Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people. And thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
\[18]And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that Eli fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate. And his neck broke, and he died, for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
\[19]And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered. And when she heard the news that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth, for her pains came upon her.
\[20]And about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, Fear not, for thou have brought forth a son. But she did not answer, neither did she regard it.
\[21]And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory has departed from Israel, because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
\[22]And she said, The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God is taken.

\[2]And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
\[3]And when those of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
\[4]And when they arose early on the morning of the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah, and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands lay cut off upon the threshold. Only the stump of Dagon was left to him.
\[5]Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any who come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, to this day.
\[6]But the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the borders of it.
\[7]And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us, for his hand is hard upon us, and upon Dagon our god.
\[8]They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about to Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel there.
\[9]And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of Jehovah was against the city with a very great discomfiture. And he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and tumors broke out upon them.
\[10]So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people.
\[11]They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it not kill us and our people. For there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
\[12]And the men who did not die were smitten with the tumors, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.

nd the ark of Jehovah was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
\[2]And the Philistines called for the priests and the psychics, saying, What shall we do with the ark of Jehovah? Show us with what we shall sent it to its place.
\[3]And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty, but by all means return for him a trespass offering. Then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
\[4]Then they said, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? And they said, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.
\[5]Therefore ye shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land. And ye shall give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
\[6]Why then do ye harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
\[7]Now therefore take and prepare for you a new cart, and two milk cows on which there has come no yoke. And tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them.
\[8]And take the ark of Jehovah, and lay it upon the cart. And put the jewels of gold, which ye return to him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side of it, and send it away, that it may go.
\[9]And watch. If it goes up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then he has done to us this great evil, but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.
\[10]And the men did so, and took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.
\[11]And they put the ark of Jehovah upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.
\[12]And the cows took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh. They went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. And the lords of the Philistines went behind them to the border of Beth-shemesh.
\[13]And those of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. And they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.
\[14]And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and stood there where there was a great stone. And they split the wood of the cart, and offered up the cows for a burnt offering to Jehovah.
\[15]And the Levites took down the ark of Jehovah, and the coffer that was with it, in which the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone. And the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Jehovah.
\[16]And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.
\[17]And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to Jehovah: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one.
\[18]And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even to the great stone on which they set down the ark of Jehovah, which stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite.
\[19]And he smote of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of Jehovah. He smote of the people fifty thousand and seventy men. And the people mourned, because Jehovah had smitten the people with a great slaughter.
\[20]And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Jehovah, this holy God? And to whom shall he go up from us?
\[21]And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of Jehovah. Come ye down, and fetch it up to you.

nd the men of Kiriath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of Jehovah, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of Jehovah.
\[2]And it came to pass, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath-jearim, that the time was long, for it was twenty years, and all the house of Israel lamented after Jehovah.
\[3]And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return to Jehovah with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts to Jehovah, and serve him only. And he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
\[4]Then the sons of Israel did put away the Baalim and the Ashtaroth, and served Jehovah only.
\[5]And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray for you to Jehovah.
\[6]And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Jehovah, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against Jehovah. And Samuel judged the sons of Israel in Mizpah.
\[7]And when the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel were gathered together to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the sons of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
\[8]And the sons of Israel said to Samuel, Do not cease to cry to Jehovah our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.
\[9]And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt offering to Jehovah. And Samuel cried to Jehovah for Israel, and Jehovah answered him.
\[10]And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel, but Jehovah thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them, and they were smitten down before Israel.
\[11]And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them until they came under Beth-car.
\[12]Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Jehovah has helped us to now.
\[13]So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the border of Israel, and the hand of Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
\[14]And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath. And Israel delivered the border of it out of the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
\[15]And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
\[16]And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpah. And he judged Israel in all those places.
\[17]And his return was to Ramah, for his house was there. And there he judged Israel, and there he built an altar to Jehovah.

nd it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
\[2]Now the name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba.
\[3]And his sons did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after dishonest gain, and took bribes, and perverted justice.
\[4]Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel to Ramah.
\[5]And they said to him, Behold, thou are old, and thy sons do not walk in thy ways. Now make for us a king to judge us like all the nations.
\[6]But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed to Jehovah.
\[7]And Jehovah said to Samuel, Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to thee, for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them.
\[8]According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also to thee.
\[9]Now therefore hearken to their voice. However thou shall protest solemnly to them, and shall show them the manner of the king who shall reign over them.
\[10]And Samuel told all the words of Jehovah to the people who asked of him a king.
\[11]And he said, This will be the manner of the king who shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them to him for his chariots, and to be his horsemen, and they shall run before his chariots.
\[12]And he will appoint them to him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties. And he will set some to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.
\[13]And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.
\[14]And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.
\[15]And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
\[16]And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your finest young men, and your donkeys, and put them to his work.
\[17]He will take the tenth of your flocks. And ye shall be his servants.
\[18]And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye shall have chosen you, and Jehovah will not answer you in that day.
\[19]But the people refused to hearken to the voice of Samuel. And they said, No, but we will have a king over us
\[20]that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
\[21]And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he repeated them in the ears of Jehovah.

ow there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor.
\[2]And he had a son whose name was Saul, a young man and fine looking. And there was not among the sons of Israel a man better looking than he. From his shoulders and upward he was taller than any of the people.
\[3]And the donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the donkeys.
\[4]And he passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and they were not there. And he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them.
\[5]When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, Come, and let us return, lest my father leave off caring for the donkeys, and be anxious for us.
\[6]And he said to him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man who is held in honor. All that he says comes surely to pass. Now let us go there, perhaps he can tell us concerning our journey on which we go.
\[7]Then Saul said to his servant, But behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God. What have we?
\[8]And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver. I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way.
\[9](Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer, for he who is now called a Prophet was formerly called a Seer.)
\[10]Then Saul said to his servant, Well said. Come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was.
\[11]As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?
\[12]And they answered them, and said, He is. Behold, he is before thee. Make haste now, for he has come today into the city, for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place.
\[13]As soon as ye have come into the city, ye shall straightaway find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he blesses the sacrifice, and afterwards those who are bidden eat. Now therefore get you up, for at this time ye shall find him.
\[14]And they went up to the city. And as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.
\[15]Now Jehovah had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,
\[16]Tomorrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel. And he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines, for I have looked upon my people, because their cry has come to me.
\[17]And when Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah said to him, Behold, the man of whom I spoke to thee! This man shall have authority over my people.
\[18]Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.
\[19]And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for ye shall eat with me today. And in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.
\[20]And as for thy donkeys that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them, for they are found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for thee, and for all thy father's house?
\[21]And Saul answered and said, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then speak thou to me according to this manner?
\[22]And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the chief place among those who were bidden, who were about thirty men.
\[23]And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said to thee, Set it by thee.
\[24]And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold, that which has been reserved! Set it before thee and eat, because it has been kept for thee to the appointed time, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
\[25]And when they came down from the high place into the city, he conversed with Saul upon the housetop.
\[26]And they arose early. And it came to pass about the dawning of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
\[27]As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand thou still first, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God.

hen Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not that Jehovah has anointed thee to be prince over his inheritance?
\[2]When thou are departed from me today, then thou shall find two men by Rachel's sepulcher in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah. And they will say to thee, The donkeys which thou went to seek are found, and, lo, thy father has left off caring for the donkeys, and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
\[3]Then thou shall go on forward from there, and thou shall come to the oak of Tabor. And there shall meet thee there three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine.
\[4]And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread, which thou shall receive from their hand.
\[5]After that thou shall come to the hill of God where is the garrison of the Philistines. And it shall come to pass, when thou have come there to the city, that thou shall meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them, and they will be prophesying.
\[6]And the Spirit of Jehovah will come mightily upon thee, and thou shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.
\[7]And let it be, when these signs have come to thee, that thou do as occasion shall serve thee, for God is with thee.
\[8]And thou shall go down before me to Gilgal. And, behold, I will come down to thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings. Thou shall tarry seven days till I come to thee, and show thee what thou shall do.
\[9]And it was so, that, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart. And all those signs came to pass that day.
\[10]And when they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him. And the Spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them.
\[11]And it came to pass, when all who knew him formerly saw, that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that has come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
\[12]And a man from the same place answered and said, And who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
\[13]And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
\[14]And Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Where did ye go? And he said, To seek the donkeys, and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.
\[15]And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said to you.
\[16]And Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the donkeys were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he did not tell him.
\[17]And Samuel called the people together to Jehovah to Mizpah.
\[18]And he said to the sons of Israel, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you,
\[19]but ye have this day rejected your God who himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses, and ye have said to him, No, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes, and by your thousands.
\[20]So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
\[21]And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families, and the family of the Matrites was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken. But when they sought him, he could not be found.
\[22]Therefore they asked of Jehovah further, Is there yet a man to come here? And Jehovah answered, Behold, he has hid himself among the baggage.
\[23]And they ran and fetched him from there. And when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
\[24]And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom Jehovah has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, Live, O king!
\[25]Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Jehovah. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
\[26]And Saul also went to his house to Gibeah, and mighty men went with him, whose hearts God had touched.
\[27]But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.

\[3]And the elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days' respite that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel, and then, if there be none to save us, we will come out to thee.
\[4]Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these words in the ears of the people. And all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
\[5]And, behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field, and Saul said, What troubles the people that they weep? And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh.
\[6]And the Spirit of God came mightily upon Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was greatly kindled.
\[7]And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whoever does not come forth behind Saul and behind Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. And the dread of Jehovah fell on the people, and they came out as one man.
\[8]And he numbered them in Bezek, and the sons of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
\[9]And they said to the messengers who came, Thus ye shall say to the men of Jabesh-gilead, Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, ye shall have deliverance. And the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh, and they were glad.
\[10]Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you, and ye shall do with us all that seems good to you.
\[11]And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies. And they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and smote the Ammonites until the heat of the day. And it came to pass, that those who remained were scattered so that not two of them were left together.
\[12]And the people said to Samuel, Who is he who said, Shall Saul reign over us? Bring the men that we may put them to death.
\[13]And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day, for today Jehovah has wrought deliverance in Israel.
\[14]Then Samuel said to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
\[15]And all the people went to Gilgal. And there they made Saul king before Jehovah in Gilgal, and there they offered sacrifices of peace offerings before Jehovah, and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.

\[2]And now, behold, the king walks before you. And I am old and gray headed, and, behold, my sons are with you. And I have walked before you from my youth to this day.
\[3]Here I am. Witness against me before Jehovah, and before his anointed: Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or of whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it? And I will restore it to you.
\[4]And they said, Thou have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have thou taken anything of any man's hand.
\[5]And he said to them, Jehovah is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found anything in my hand. And they said, He is witness.
\[6]And Samuel said to the people, It is Jehovah who appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
\[7]Now therefore stand still that I may plead with you before Jehovah concerning all the righteous acts of Jehovah, which he did to you and to your fathers.
\[8]When Jacob had come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to Jehovah, then Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.
\[9]But they forgot Jehovah their God, and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
\[10]And they cried to Jehovah, and said, We have sinned because we have forsaken Jehovah, and have served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth, but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
\[11]And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelt in safety.
\[12]And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon came against you, ye said to me, No, but a king shall reign over us, when Jehovah your God was your king.
\[13]Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have asked for. And, behold, Jehovah has set a king over you.
\[14]If ye will fear Jehovah, and serve him, and hearken to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, then both ye and also the king who reigns over you shall be followers of Jehovah your God.
\[15]But if ye will not hearken to the voice of Jehovah, but rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, then the hand of Jehovah will be against you as it was against your fathers.
\[16]Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Jehovah will do before your eyes.
\[17]Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call to Jehovah that he may send thunder and rain, and ye shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of Jehovah in asking a king for you.
\[18]So Samuel called to Jehovah, and Jehovah sent thunder and rain that day. And all the people greatly feared Jehovah and Samuel.
\[19]And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for thy servants to Jehovah thy God that we not die, for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask a king for us.
\[20]And Samuel said to the people, Fear not. Ye have indeed done all this evil, yet turn not aside from following Jehovah, but serve Jehovah with all your heart.
\[21]And turn ye not aside after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain.
\[22]For Jehovah will not forsake his people for his great name's sake, because it has pleased Jehovah to make you a people to himself.
\[23]Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you. But I will instruct you in the good and the right way.
\[24]Only fear Jehovah, and serve him in truth with all your heart, for consider what great things he has done for you.

\[3]And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
\[4]And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.
\[5]And the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel: thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude. And they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth-aven.
\[6]When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits.

\[9]And Saul said, Bring here the burnt offering to me, and the peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.
\[10]And it came to pass that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came, and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
\[11]And Samuel said, What have thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash,
\[12]therefore I said, Now the Philistines will come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of Jehovah. I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt offering.
\[13]And Samuel said to Saul, Thou have done foolishly. Thou have not kept the commandment of Jehovah thy God, which he commanded thee. For now Jehovah would have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever,
\[14]but now thy kingdom shall not continue. Jehovah has sought for him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah has appointed him to be prince over his people, because thou have not kept that which Jehovah commanded thee.
\[15]And Samuel arose, and got up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.
\[16]And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin, but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
\[17]And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual,
\[18]and another company turned the way to Beth-horon, and another company turned the way of the border that looks down upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
\[19]Now there was no blacksmith found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make for them swords or spears,
\[20]but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.
\[21]Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.
\[22]So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan. But with Saul and with Jonathan his son there was found.
\[23]And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.

ow it fell upon a day that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison that is on yonder side. But he did not tell his father.
\[2]And Saul abode in the outermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron. And the people who were with him were about six hundred men,
\[3]and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Jehovah in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan was gone.
\[4]And between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side. And the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
\[5]The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.
\[6]And Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that Jehovah will work for us, for there is no limitation to Jehovah to save by many or by few.
\[7]And his armor bearer said to him, Do all that is in thy heart. Turn thee, behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.
\[8]Then Jonathan said, Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will disclose ourselves to them.
\[9]If they say thus to us, Tarry until we come to you, then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.
\[10]But if they say thus, Come up to us, then we will go up, for Jehovah has delivered them into our hand, and this shall be the sign to us.
\[11]And both of them disclosed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
\[12]And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said to his armor bearer, Come up after me, for Jehovah has delivered them into the hand of Israel.
\[13]And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armor bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armor bearer killed them after him.
\[14]And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land.
\[15]And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled. And the earth quaked, so there was an exceedingly great trembling.
\[16]And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went here and there.
\[17]Then Saul said to the people who were with him, Number now, and see who has gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.
\[18]And Saul said to Ahijah, Bring here the ark of God. For the ark of God was there at that time with the sons of Israel.
\[19]And it came to pass, while Saul talked to the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased. And Saul said to the priest, Withdraw thy hand.
\[20]And Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle. And, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.
\[21]Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as formerly, and who went up with them into the camp, from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
\[22]Likewise all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed close after them in the battle.
\[23]So Jehovah saved Israel that day, and the battle passed over by Beth-aven.
\[24]And the men of Israel were distressed that day, for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man who eats any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted food.
\[25]And all the people came into the forest, and there was honey upon the ground.
\[26]And when the people came to the forest, behold, the honey dropped, but no man put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.
\[27]But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath, therefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were enlightened.
\[28]Then one of the people answered, and said, Thy father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man who eats food this day, and the people were faint.
\[29]Then Jonathan said, My father has troubled the land. See, I pray you, how my eyes have been enlightened because I tasted a little of this honey.
\[30]How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found? For now there has been no great slaughter among the Philistines.
\[31]And they smote of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint,
\[32]and the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and killed them on the ground. And the people ate them with the blood.
\[33]Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against Jehovah, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, ye have dealt treacherously. Roll a great stone to me this day.
\[34]And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and kill them here, and eat. And sin not against Jehovah in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and killed them there.
\[35]And Saul built an altar to Jehovah; the same was the first altar that he built to Jehovah.
\[36]And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatever seems good to thee. Then the priest said, Let us draw near here to God.
\[37]And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he did not answer him that day.
\[38]And Saul said, Draw near here, all ye chiefs of the people, and know and see how this sin has been this day.
\[39]For, as Jehovah lives, who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.
\[40]Then he said to all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what seems good to thee.
\[41]Therefore Saul said to Jehovah, the God of Israel, Show the right. And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, but the people escaped.
\[42]And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
\[43]Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou have done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand. And, lo, I must die.
\[44]And Saul said, God do so and more also, for thou shall surely die, Jonathan.
\[45]And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far from it. As Jehovah lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he has wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he did not die.
\[46]Then Saul went up from following the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.
\[47]Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the sons of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. And wherever he turned himself, he put them to the worse.
\[48]And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them.
\[49]Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua. And the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.
\[50]And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
\[51]And Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
\[52]And there was great war against the Philistines all the days of Saul. And when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him to him.

nd Samuel said to Saul, Jehovah sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel. Now therefore hearken thou to the voice of the words of Jehovah.
\[2]Thus says Jehovah of hosts, I have remembered that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way when he came up out of Egypt.
\[3]Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not, but kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.
\[4]And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
\[5]And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
\[6]And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them, for ye showed kindness to all the sons of Israel when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
\[7]And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou go to Shur, that is before Egypt.
\[8]And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
\[9]But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them. But everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
\[10]Then the word of Jehovah came to Samuel, saying,
\[11]I regret that I have set up Saul to be king, for he has turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments. And Samuel was angry, and he cried out to Jehovah all night.
\[12]And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set up for him a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.
\[13]And Samuel came to Saul. And Saul said to him, Blessed be thou of Jehovah. I have performed the commandment of Jehovah.
\[14]And Samuel said, What then means this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
\[15]And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God, and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
\[16]Then Samuel said to Saul, Stop, and I will tell thee what Jehovah has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.
\[17]And Samuel said, Though thou were little in thine own sight, were thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel.
\[18]And Jehovah sent thee on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.
\[19]Why then did thou not obey the voice of Jehovah, but did fly upon the spoil, and did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah?
\[20]And Saul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah, and have gone the way which Jehovah sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
\[21]But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.
\[22]And Samuel said, Has Jehovah as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
\[23]For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because thou have rejected the word of Jehovah, he has also rejected thee from being king.
\[24]And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah, and thy words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
\[25]Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me that I may worship Jehovah.
\[26]And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with thee, for thou have rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah has rejected thee from being king over Israel.
\[27]And as Samuel turned about to go away, Saul laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it tore.
\[28]And Samuel said to him, Jehovah has torn the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and has given it to a neighbor of thine, who is better than thou.
\[29]And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent, for he is not a man that he should repent.
\[30]Then he said, I have sinned. Yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah thy God.
\[31]So Samuel turned again after Saul, and Saul worshiped Jehovah.
\[32]Then Samuel said, Bring ye here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
\[33]And Samuel said, As thy sword has made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal.
\[34]Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
\[35]And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death, for Samuel mourned for Saul, and Jehovah regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.

nd Jehovah said to Samuel, How long will thou mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill thy horn with oil, and go. I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for me a king among his sons.
\[2]And Samuel said, How do I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me. And Jehovah said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I have come to sacrifice to Jehovah.
\[3]And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shall do. And thou shall anoint to me him whom I name to thee.
\[4]And Samuel did that which Jehovah spoke, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Do thou come peaceably?
\[5]And he said, Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to Jehovah. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
\[6]And it came to pass, when they came, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely Jehovah's anointed is before him.
\[7]But Jehovah said to Samuel, Do not look on his countenance, or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For Jehovah sees not as man sees, for man looks on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looks on the heart.
\[8]Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has Jehovah chosen this man.
\[9]Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither has Jehovah chosen this man.
\[10]And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, Jehovah has not chosen these men.
\[11]And Samuel said to Jesse, Are all thy sons here? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he is keeping the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him, for we will not sit down till he comes here.
\[12]And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and of a beautiful countenance, and fine to look upon. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him, for this is he.
\[13]Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
\[14]Now the Spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled him.
\[15]And Saul's servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubles thee.
\[16]Let our lord now command thy servants, who are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp. And it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shall be well.
\[17]And Saul said to his servants, Provide for me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.
\[18]Then one of the young men answered, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely man, and Jehovah is with him.
\[19]Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send to me David thy son, who is with the sheep.
\[20]And Jesse took a donkey with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul.
\[21]And David came to Saul, and stood before him. And he loved him greatly, and he became his armor bearer.
\[22]And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me, for he has found favor in my sight.
\[23]And it came to pass, when the spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand. So Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.

ow the Philistines gathered their armies together to battle. And they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
\[2]And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the vale of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
\[3]And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, and there was a valley between them.
\[4]And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
\[5]And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail. And the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.
\[6]And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders.
\[7]And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron. And his shield-bearer went before him.
\[8]And he stood and cried out to the armies of Israel, and said to them, Why have ye come out to set your battle in array? Am I not a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? Choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.
\[9]If he is able to fight with me, and kill me, then we will be your servants, but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then ye shall be our servants, and serve us.
\[10]And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day. Give me a man, that we may fight together.
\[11]And when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
\[12]Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem-judah, whose name was Jesse. And he had eight sons, and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken in years among men.
\[13]And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
\[14]And David was the youngest, and the three eldest followed Saul.
\[15]Now David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
\[16]And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
\[17]And Jesse said to David his son, Take now for thy brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to thy brothers.
\[18]And bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand. And look how thy brothers fare, and take their pledge.
\[19]Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
\[20]And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the place of the wagons as the army which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle.
\[21]And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.
\[22]And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and saluted his brothers.
\[23]And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words, and David heard them.
\[24]And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were greatly afraid.
\[25]And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man who has come up? Surely to defy Israel he has come up. And it shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.
\[26]And David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?
\[27]And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that kills him.
\[28]And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. And Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why have thou come down? And with whom have thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the mischief of thy heart, for thou have come down that thou might see the battle.
\[29]And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?
\[30]And he turned away from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner, and the people answered him again after the former manner.
\[31]And when the words were heard which David spoke, they repeated them before Saul, and he sent for him.
\[32]And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him. Thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
\[33]And Saul said to David, Thou are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for thou are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
\[34]And David said to Saul, Thy servant was keeping his father's sheep, and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock,
\[35]I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth. And when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and killed him.
\[36]Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.
\[37]And David said, Jehovah who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and Jehovah shall be with thee.
\[38]And Saul clad David with his apparel, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.
\[39]And David girded his sword upon his apparel, and he attempted to go, for he had not tested them. And David said to Saul, I cannot go with these, for I have not tested them. And David put them off of him.
\[40]And he took his staff in his hand, and chose for him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had, even in his wallet. And his sling was in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine.
\[41]And the Philistine came on and drew near to David, and the man who bore the shield went before him.
\[42]And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him, for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.
\[43]And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that thou come to me with sticks? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
\[44]And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the field.
\[45]Then David said to the Philistine, Thou come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin, but I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou have defied.
\[46]This day Jehovah will deliver thee into my hand, and I will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee. And I will give the dead bodies of the armies of the Philistines this day to the birds of the heavens, and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
\[47]and that all this assembly may know that Jehovah saves not with sword and spear. For the battle is Jehovah's, and he will give you into our hand.
\[48]And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.
\[49]And David put his hand in his bag, and took from there a stone, and slung it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead. And the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth.
\[50]So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. But there was no sword in the hand of David.
\[51]Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath of it, and killed him, and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
\[52]And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines until thou come to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron.
\[53]And the sons of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.
\[54]And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.
\[55]And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.
\[56]And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is.
\[57]And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
\[58]And Saul said to him, Whose son are thou, young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.

nd it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
\[2]And Saul took him that day, and would no more let him go home to his father's house.
\[3]Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
\[4]And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his apparel, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his belt.
\[5]And David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely. And Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
\[6]And it came to pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels, with joy, and with instruments of music.
\[7]And the women sang one to another as they played, and said, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
\[8]And Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him, and he said, They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands, and what can he have more but the kingdom?
\[9]And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
\[10]And it came to pass on the morrow, that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house. And David played with his hand, as he did day by day, and Saul had his spear in his hand.
\[11]And Saul cast the spear, for he said, I will smite David even to the wall. And David turned away from his presence twice.
\[12]And Saul was afraid of David because Jehovah was with him, and was departed from Saul.
\[13]Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand, and he went out and came in before the people.
\[14]And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways, and Jehovah was with him.
\[15]And when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.
\[16]But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them.
\[17]And Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, I will give her to thee for a wife. Only be thou valiant for me, and fight Jehovah's battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.
\[18]And David said to Saul, Who am I, and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?
\[19]But it came to pass at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
\[20]And Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David, and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
\[21]And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Therefore Saul said to David, Thou shall this day be my son-in-law a second time.
\[22]And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Converse with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king has delight in thee, and all his servants love thee. Now therefore be the king's son-in-law.
\[23]And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Does it seem to you a light thing to be the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
\[24]And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner David spoke.
\[25]And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king does not desire any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
\[26]And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law. And the days were not expired.
\[27]And David arose and went, he and his men, and killed of the Philistines two hundred men. And David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.
\[28]And Saul saw and knew that Jehovah was with David, and Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.
\[29]And Saul was yet the more afraid of David, and Saul was David's enemy continually.
\[30]Then the rulers of the Philistines went forth, and it came to pass, as often as they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was very precious.

nd Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David.
\[2]And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill thee. Now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself in the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself.
\[3]And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou are, and I will converse with my father of thee, and if I see anything, I will tell thee.
\[4]And Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David, because he has not sinned against thee, and because his works have been very good toward thee.
\[5]For he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and Jehovah wrought a great victory for all Israel. Thou saw it, and rejoiced. Why then will thou sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?
\[6]And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan. And Saul swore, As Jehovah lives, he shall not be put to death.
\[7]And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as beforetime.
\[8]And there was war again. And David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter, and they fled before him.
\[9]And an evil spirit from Jehovah was upon Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand, and David was playing with his hand.
\[10]And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the spear into the wall. And David fled, and escaped that night.
\[11]And Saul sent messengers to David's house, to watch him, and to kill him in the morning. And Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, If thou save not thy life tonight, tomorrow thou will be slain.
\[12]So Michal let David down through the window, and he went, and fled, and escaped.
\[13]And Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair at the head of it, and covered it with the clothes.
\[14]And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.
\[15]And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.
\[16]And when the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats' hair at the head of it.
\[17]And Saul said to Michal, Why have thou deceived me thus, and let my enemy go, so that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said to me, Let me go. Why should I kill thee?
\[18]Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
\[19]And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
\[20]And Saul sent messengers to take David. And when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
\[21]And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.
\[22]Then he also went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu. And he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.
\[23]And he went there to Naioth in Ramah, and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
\[24]And he also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?

nd David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? What is my iniquity, and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeks my life?
\[2]And he said to him, Far from it. Thou shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it to me, and why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so.
\[3]And David swore moreover, and said, Thy father knows well that I have found favor in thine eyes, and he says, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved. But truly as Jehovah lives, and as thy soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.
\[4]Then Jonathan said to David, Whatever thy soul desires, I will even do it for thee.
\[5]And David said to Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king to eat. But let me go that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening.
\[6]If thy father misses me at all, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city, for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
\[7]If he says thus, It is well. Thy servant shall have peace. But if he is angry, then know that evil is determined by him.
\[8]Therefore deal kindly with thy servant, for thou have brought thy servant into a covenant of Jehovah with thee. But if there be in me iniquity, kill me thyself, for why should thou bring me to thy father?
\[9]And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee, for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would I not tell it to thee?
\[10]Then David said to Jonathan, Who shall tell me if perchance thy father answers thee roughly?
\[11]And Jonathan said to David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
\[12]And Jonathan said to David, Jehovah, the God of Israel-when I have sounded my father about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send to thee, and disclose it to thee?
\[13]Jehovah do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I not disclose it to thee, and send thee away that thou may go in peace. And Jehovah be with thee as he has been with my father.
\[14]And thou shall not only show me the loving kindness of Jehovah, while I yet live, that I not die,
\[15]but also thou shall not cut off thy kindness from my house forever. No, not when Jehovah has cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.
\[16]So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, And Jehovah will require it at the hand of David's enemies.
\[17]And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him. For he loved him as he loved his own soul.
\[18]Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon, and thou will be missed because thy seat will be empty.
\[19]And when thou have stayed three days, thou shall go down quickly, and come to the place where thou hid thyself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.
\[20]And I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.
\[21]And, behold, I will send the lad, saying, Go, find the arrows. If I say to the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them, and come, for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as Jehovah lives.
\[22]But if I say thus to the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee, go thy way, for Jehovah has sent thee away.
\[23]And concerning the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, Jehovah is between thee and me forever.
\[24]So David hid himself in the field. And when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food.
\[25]And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall, and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul's side, but David's place was empty.
\[26]Nevertheless Saul spoke nothing that day, for he thought, Something has befallen him. He is not clean. Surely he is not clean.
\[27]And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, which was the second day, that David's place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why has the son of Jesse not come in to the food, neither yesterday, nor today?
\[28]And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem.
\[29]And he said, Let me go, I pray thee, for our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother, he has commanded me. And now, if I have found favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brothers. Therefore he has not come to the king's table.
\[30]Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, Thou son of a perverse rebellious woman, do I not know that thou have chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and to the shame of thy mother's nakedness?
\[31]For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the ground, thou shall not be established, nor thy kingdom. Therefore now send and fetch him to me, for he shall surely die.
\[32]And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why should he be put to death? What has he done?
\[33]And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him. By this Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to put David to death.
\[34]So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David because his father had done him shame.
\[35]And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.
\[36]And he said to his lad, Run, now find the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
\[37]And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?
\[38]And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
\[39]But the lad knew nothing. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
\[40]And Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city.
\[41]And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times. And they kissed each other, and wept one with another until David surpassed him.
\[42]And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, inasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah shall be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed, forever. And he arose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city.

hen David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, Why are thou alone, and no man with thee?
\[2]And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me a business, and has said to me, Let no man know anything of the business about which I send thee, and what I have commanded thee, and I have assigned the young men to such and such a place.
\[3]Now therefore what is under thy hand? Give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever there is present.
\[4]And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread. If only the young men have kept themselves from women.
\[5]And David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days. When I came out the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey. How much more then today shall their vessels be holy?
\[6]So the priest gave him holy bread, for there was no bread there but the showbread that was taken from before Jehovah to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
\[7]Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Jehovah. And his name was Doeg the Edomite, the foremost of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.
\[8]And David said to Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand spear or sword? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.
\[9]And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou killed in the vale of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If thou will take that, take it, for there is no other except that here. And David said, There is none like that. Give it to me.
\[10]And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
\[11]And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
\[12]And David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
\[13]And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.
\[14]Then Achish said to his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad. Why then have ye brought him to me?
\[15]Do I lack madmen, that ye have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?

avid therefore departed from there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam. And when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down there to him.
\[2]And every man who was in distress, and every man who was in debt, and every man who was discontented, gathered themselves to him, and he became captain over them. And there were with him about four hundred men.
\[3]And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab, and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.
\[4]And he brought them before the king of Moab, and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.
\[5]And the prophet Gad said to David, Abide not in the stronghold. Depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.
\[6]And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree in Ramah with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.
\[7]And Saul said to his servants who stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites. Will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards? Will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,
\[8]that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none who discloses to me when my son makes a league with the son of Jesse? And there is none of you who is sorry for me, or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day.
\[9]Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
\[10]And he inquired of Jehovah for him, and gave him food, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
\[11]Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests who were in Nob. And they came to the king, all of them.
\[12]And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.
\[13]And Saul said to him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou have given him bread, and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me to lie in wait as at this day?
\[14]Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who among all thy servants is so faithful as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and is taken into thy council, and is honorable in thy house?
\[15]Have I today begun to inquire of God for him? Be it far from me. Let not the king impute anything to his servant, nor to all the house of my father, for thy servant knows nothing of all this, less or more.
\[16]And the king said, Thou shall surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.
\[17]And the king said to the guard who stood about him, Turn, and kill the priests of Jehovah, because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and did not disclose it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of Jehovah.
\[18]And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore a linen ephod.
\[19]And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and women, sons and sucklings, and oxen and donkeys and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
\[20]And one of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.
\[21]And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Jehovah's priests.
\[22]And David said to Abiathar, I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.
\[23]Abide thou with me. Fear not, for he who seeks my life seeks thy life, for with me thou shall be in safeguard.

\[2]Therefore David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And Jehovah said to David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.
\[3]And David's men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
\[4]Then David inquired of Jehovah yet again. And Jehovah answered him, and said, Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
\[5]And David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and killed them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
\[6]And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.
\[7]And it was told Saul that David came to Keilah. And Saul said, God has delivered him into my hand, for he is shut in by entering into a town that has gates and bars.
\[8]And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
\[9]And David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him, and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.
\[10]Then said David, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thy servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah to destroy the city for my sake.
\[11]Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? Will Saul come down as thy servant has heard? O Jehovah, the God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And Jehovah said, He will come down.
\[12]Then David said, Will the men of Keilah deliver up me and my men into the hand of Saul? And Jehovah said, They will deliver thee up.
\[13]Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah, and he ceased to go forth.
\[14]And David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill-country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand.
\[15]And David saw that Saul came out to seek his life, and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the forest.
\[16]And Jonathan, Saul's son, arose, and went to David into the forest, and strengthened his hand in God.
\[17]And he said to him, Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee. And thou shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to thee. And that, Saul my father also knows.
\[18]And those two made a covenant before Jehovah. And David abode in the forest, and Jonathan went to his house.
\[19]Then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the forest, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?
\[20]Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of thy soul to come down, and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king's hand.
\[21]And Saul said, Blessed be ye of Jehovah, for ye have had compassion on me.
\[22]Go, I pray you, make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there, for it is told me that he deals very shrewdly.
\[23]See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hides himself, and come ye again to me of a certainty. And I will go with you, and it shall come to pass, if he is in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.
\[24]And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul, but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.
\[25]And Saul and his men went to seek him. And they told David. Therefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
\[26]And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain. And David made haste to get away for fear of Saul. For Saul and his men encompassed David and his men round about to take them.
\[27]But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Hasten thee, and come, for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.
\[28]So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines. Therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth.
\[29]And David went up from there, and dwelt in the strongholds of En-gedi.

nd it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.
\[2]Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
\[3]And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave, and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.
\[4]And the men of David said to him, Behold, the day of which Jehovah said to thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand, and thou shall do to him as it shall seem good to thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe secretly.
\[5]And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
\[6]And he said to his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, Jehovah's anointed, to put forth my hand against him, since he is Jehovah's anointed.
\[7]So David restrained his men with these words, and did not allow them to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.
\[8]David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.
\[9]And David said to Saul, Why do thou hearken to men's words, saying, Behold, David seeks thy hurt?
\[10]Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that Jehovah had delivered thee today into my hand in the cave. And some bade me kill thee, but I spared thee. And I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord, for he is Jehovah's anointed.
\[11]Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand, for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not. Know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee, though thou hunt after my life to take it.
\[12]Jehovah judge between me and thee, and Jehovah avenge me of thee, but my hand shall not be upon thee.
\[13]As says the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness, but my hand shall not be upon thee.
\[14]After whom is the king of Israel come out? After whom do thou pursue? After a dead dog, after a flea.
\[15]Jehovah therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.
\[16]And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
\[17]And he said to David, Thou are more righteous than I, for thou have rendered to me good, whereas I have rendered to thee evil.
\[18]And thou have declared this day how that thou have dealt well with me, inasmuch as when Jehovah had delivered me up into thy hand, thou killed me not.
\[19]For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away well? Therefore Jehovah reward thee good for that which thou have done to me this day.
\[20]And now, behold, I know that thou shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand.
\[21]Swear now therefore to me by Jehovah, that thou will not cut off my seed after me, and that thou will not destroy my name out of my father's house.
\[22]And David swore to Saul. And Saul went home, but David and his men got up to the stronghold.

\[2]And there was a man in Maon whose possessions were in Carmel. And the man was very great in goods, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats. And he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
\[3]Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail. And the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance, but the man was churlish and evil in his doings, and he was of the house of Caleb.
\[4]And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
\[5]And David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name.
\[6]And thus ye shall say to him who lives in prosperity, Peace be to thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be to all that thou have.
\[7]And now I have heard that thou have shearers. Thy shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there anything missing to them all the while they were in Carmel.
\[8]Ask thy young men, and they will tell thee. Therefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes, for we come in a good day. Give, I pray thee, whatever comes to thy hand to thy servants, and to thy son David.
\[9]And when David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
\[10]And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants now-a-days who break away every man from his master.
\[11]Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men of whom I know not from where they are?
\[12]So David's young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words.
\[13]And David said to his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword, and David also girded on his sword. And there went up after David about four hundred men, and two hundred abode by the baggage.
\[14]But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master, and he railed at them.
\[15]But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither did we miss anything as long as we went with them when we were in the fields.
\[16]They were a wall to us both by night and by day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
\[17]Now therefore know and consider what thou will do, for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house. For he is such a worthless fellow that a man cannot speak to him.
\[18]Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.
\[19]And she said to her young men, Go on before me, behold, I come after you. But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
\[20]And it was so, as she rode on her donkey, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold, David and his men came down toward her, and she met them.
\[21]Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him, and he has returned me evil for good.
\[22]God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that pertains to him by the morning light so much as one man-child.
\[23]And when Abigail saw David, she hastened, and alighted from her donkey, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.
\[24]And she fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity, and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy handmaid.
\[25]Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him. But I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whom thou sent.
\[26]Now therefore, my lord, as Jehovah lives, and as thy soul lives, since Jehovah has withheld thee from blood guiltiness, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now therefore let thine enemies, and those who seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
\[27]And now this present which thy servant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.
\[28]Forgive, I pray thee, the trespass of thy handmaid. For Jehovah will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fights the battles of Jehovah, and evil shall not be found in thee all thy days.
\[29]And though men be risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Jehovah thy God. And the souls of thine enemies, them he shall sling out as from the hollow of a sling.
\[30]And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee prince over Israel,
\[31]that this shall be no grief to thee, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that thou have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. And when Jehovah shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.
\[32]And David said to Abigail, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me,
\[33]and blessed be thy discretion, and blessed be thou, who have kept me this day from blood guiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand.
\[34]For in very deed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, lives, who has withheld me from hurting thee, unless thou had hastened and come to meet me, surely there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light so much as one man-child.
\[35]So David received from her hand that which she had brought him. And he said to her, Go up in peace to thy house. See, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.
\[36]And Abigail came to Nabal, and, behold, he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king. And Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk. Therefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
\[37]And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
\[38]And it came to pass about ten days after, that Jehovah smote Nabal, so that he died.
\[39]And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Jehovah, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil, and the evil-doing of Nabal Jehovah has returned upon his own head. And David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to him to wife.
\[40]And when the servants of David came to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to thee, to take thee to him to wife.
\[41]And she arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, thy handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
\[42]And Abigail hastened, and arose, and rode upon a donkey, with five of her damsels who followed her. And she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
\[43]David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they became his wives, both of them.
\[44]Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.

nd the Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?
\[2]Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
\[3]And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
\[4]David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul definitely came.
\[5]And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army. And Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped around about him.
\[6]Then David answered and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
\[7]So David and Abishai came to the people by night. And, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons with his spear stuck in the ground at his head, and Abner and the people lay round about him.
\[8]Then said Abishai to David, God has delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day. Now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not smite him the second time.
\[9]And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not, for who can put forth his hand against Jehovah's anointed, and be guiltless?
\[10]And David said, As Jehovah lives, Jehovah will smite him, or his day shall come to die, or he shall go down into battle and perish.
\[11]Jehovah forbid that I should put forth my hand against Jehovah's anointed. But now take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water, and let us go.
\[12]So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's head, and they got away. And no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake, for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Jehovah was fallen upon them.
\[13]Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off, a great space being between them.
\[14]And David cried out to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answer thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who are thou that cries to the king?
\[15]And David said to Abner, Are not thou a valiant man? And who is like to thee in Israel? Why then have thou not kept watch over thy lord the king? For there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.
\[16]This thing is not good that thou have done. As Jehovah lives, ye are worthy to die because ye have not kept watch over your lord, Jehovah's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.
\[17]And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.
\[18]And he said, Why does my lord pursue after his servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my hand?
\[19]Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be Jehovah who has stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering, but if it be the sons of men, cursed be they before Jehovah. For they have driven me out this day that I should not cling to the inheritance of Jehovah, saying, Go, serve other gods.
\[20]Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Jehovah. For the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when a man hunts a partridge in the mountains.
\[21]Then Saul said, I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will no more do thee harm because my life was precious in thine eyes this day. Behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
\[22]And David answered and said, Behold the spear, O king! Let then one of the young men come over and fetch it.
\[23]And Jehovah will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness, inasmuch as Jehovah delivered thee into my hand today, and I would not put forth my hand against Jehovah's anointed.
\[24]And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in my eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of Jehovah, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.
\[25]Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David. Thou shall both do mightily, and shall surely prevail. So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.

nd David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines, and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel, so I shall escape out of his hand.
\[2]And David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
\[3]And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.
\[4]And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath, and he sought no more again for him.
\[5]And David said to Achish, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country that I may dwell there, for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?
\[6]Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day. Therefore Ziklag pertains to the kings of Judah to this day.
\[7]And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
\[8]And David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites, for those nations were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old as thou go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.
\[9]And David smote the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the donkeys, and the camels, and the apparel, and he returned, and came to Achish.
\[10]And Achish said, Against whom have ye made a raid today? And David said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.
\[11]And David saved neither man nor woman alive to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell of us, saying, So did David, and so has been his manner all the while he has dwelt in the country of the Philistines.
\[12]And Achish believed David, saying, He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him. Therefore he shall be my servant forever.

nd it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare to fight with Israel. And Achish said to David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shall go out with me in the army, thou and thy men.
\[2]And David said to Achish, Therefore thou shall know what thy servant will do. And Achish said to David, Therefore I will make thee my chief bodyguard forever.
\[3]Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
\[4]And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem. And Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.
\[5]And when Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
\[6]And when Saul inquired of Jehovah, Jehovah answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
\[7]Then Saul said to his servants, Seek me a woman who has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who has a familiar spirit at En-dor.
\[8]And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him. And they came to the woman by night, and he said, Divine to me, I pray thee, by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomever I shall name to thee.
\[9]And the woman said to him, Behold, thou know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. Why then do thou lay a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
\[10]And Saul swore to her by Jehovah, saying, As Jehovah lives, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.
\[11]Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up to thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
\[12]And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice. And the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have thou deceived me? For thou are Saul.
\[13]And the king said to her, Be not afraid, for what do thou see? And the woman said to Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.
\[14]And he said to her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man comes up, and he is covered with a robe. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.
\[15]And Samuel said to Saul, Why have thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am greatly distressed, for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams. Therefore I have called thee, that thou may make known to me what I shall do.
\[16]And Samuel said, Why then do thou ask of me, since Jehovah departed from thee, and has become thine adversary?
\[17]And Jehovah has done to thee, as he spoke by me. And Jehovah has torn the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David.
\[18]Because thou obeyed not the voice of Jehovah, and did not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore Jehovah has done this thing to thee this day.
\[19]Moreover Jehovah will deliver Israel also with thee into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow thou and thy sons shall be with me. Jehovah will also deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
\[20]Then Saul fell straightaway his full length upon the earth, and was greatly afraid because of the words of Samuel, and there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
\[21]And the woman came to Saul, and saw that he was greatly troubled, and said to him, Behold, thy handmaid has hearkened to thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened to thy words which thou spoke to me.
\[22]Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also to the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee, and eat, that thou may have strength when thou go on thy way.
\[23]But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him, and he hearkened to their voice. So he arose from the ground, and sat upon the bed.
\[24]And the woman had a fatted calf in the house. And she hastened, and killed it, and she took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread of it.
\[25]And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants, and they ate. Then they rose up, and went away that night.

\[2]And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands, and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish.
\[3]Then the rulers of the Philistines said, What are these Hebrews? And Achish said to the rulers of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or rather these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away to me to this day?
\[4]But the rulers of the Philistines were angry with him. And the rulers of the Philistines said to him, Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where thou have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For with what does this man reconcile himself to his lord? Would it not be with the heads of these men?
\[5]Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?
\[6]Then Achish called David, and said to him, As Jehovah lives, thou have been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the army is good in my sight, for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming to me to this day. Nevertheless the lords do not favor thee.
\[7]Therefore now return, and go in peace, that thou not displease the lords of the Philistines.
\[8]And David said to Achish, But what have I done? And what have thou found in thy servant so long as I have been before thee to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
\[9]And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou are good in my sight, as an agent of God, notwithstanding the rulers of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
\[10]Therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord who have come with thee, and as soon as ye are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.

\[2]and had taken captive the women and all that were in it, both small and great. They did not kill any, but carried them off, and went their way.
\[3]And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire. And their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive.
\[4]Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
\[5]And David's two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
\[6]And David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters. But David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God.
\[7]And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, I pray thee, bring me here the ephod. And Abiathar brought there the ephod to David.
\[8]And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue, for thou shall surely overtake them, and shall without fail recover all.
\[9]So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.
\[10]But David pursued, he and four hundred men, for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.
\[11]And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread. And he ate, and they gave him water to drink.
\[12]And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins. And when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him, for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.
\[13]And David said to him, To whom do thou belong? And from where are thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite. And my master left me because three days ago I fell sick.
\[14]We made a raid upon the South of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongs to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire.
\[15]And David said to him, Will thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear to me by God, that thou will neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.
\[16]And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
\[17]And David smote them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day. And there escaped not a man of them, except four hundred young men who rode upon camels and fled.
\[18]And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and David rescued his two wives.
\[19]And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them; David brought back all.
\[20]And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.
\[21]And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor. And they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him. And when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
\[22]Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows of those who went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them anything of the spoil that we have recovered except to every man his wife and his children that he may lead them away, and depart.
\[23]Then David said, Ye shall not do so, my brothers, with that which Jehovah has given to us, who has preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.
\[24]And who will hearken to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle so shall his share be who remains by the baggage; they shall share alike.
\[25]And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
\[26]And when David came to Ziklag, he sent from the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold, a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah:
\[27]to those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth of the South, and to those who were in Jattir,
\[28]and to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth, and to those who were in Eshtemoa,

\[3]And the battle went severely against Saul, and the archers overtook him, and he was greatly distressed because of the archers.
\[4]Then Saul said to his armor bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor bearer would not, for he was very afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.

\[2]it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes torn, and earth upon his head. And so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the ground, and did obeisance.
\[3]And David said to him, From where did thou come? And he said to him, I escaped out of the camp of Israel.
\[4]And David said to him, How did the matter go? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead, and Saul and Jonathan his son are also dead.
\[5]And David said to the young man who told him, How do thou know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?
\[6]And the young man who told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear, and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed close after him.
\[7]And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here I am.
\[8]And he said to me, Who are thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
\[9]And he said to me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and kill me, for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.
\[10]So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he was fallen. And I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.
\[11]Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them, and likewise all the men who were with him.
\[12]And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel, because they were fallen by the sword.
\[13]And David said to the young man who told him, From where are thou? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.
\[14]And David said to him, Why were thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah's anointed?
\[15]And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him so that he died.
\[16]And David said to him, Thy blood be upon thy head, for thy mouth has testified against thee, saying, I have slain Jehovah's anointed.
\[17]And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son
\[18](and he bade them teach the sons of Judah the song of the bow; behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):
\[19]Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty fallen!
\[20]Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
\[21]Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of offerings, for there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
\[22]From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
\[23]Saul and Jonathan, men who were loved and pleasant, undivided; comely in their lives, and undivided in their death; swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
\[24]Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you delicately in scarlet, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
\[25]How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain upon thy high places.
\[26]I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan. Very pleasant thou have been to me. Thy love to me was wonderful, exceeding the love of women.
\[27]How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

nd it came to pass after this, that David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And Jehovah said to him, Go up. And David said, Where shall I go up? And he said, To Hebron.
\[2]So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
\[3]And David brought up his men who were with him, every man with his household, and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
\[4]And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, The men of Jabesh-gilead were those who buried Saul.
\[5]And David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, Blessed be ye of Jehovah, that ye have shown this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.
\[6]And now Jehovah show loving kindness and truth to you. And I also will reward you this kindness because ye have done this thing.
\[7]Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant, for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
\[8]Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's army, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim.
\[9]And he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
\[10]Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
\[11]And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
\[12]And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
\[13]And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon. And they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
\[14]And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men, I pray thee, arise and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
\[15]Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
\[16]And each man caught his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side, so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.
\[17]And the battle was very severe that day. And Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
\[18]And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel. And Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.
\[19]And Asahel pursued after Abner, and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
\[20]Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it thou, Asahel? And he answered, It is I.
\[21]And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay hold on one of the young men, and take his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
\[22]And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me. Why should I smite thee to the ground? How then would I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?
\[23]However he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him. And he fell down there, and died in the same place. And it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.
\[24]But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner. And the sun went down when they came to the hill of Ammah that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
\[25]And the sons of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.
\[26]Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? Know thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, before thou bid the people return from following their brothers?
\[27]And Joab said, As God lives unless thou had spoken, surely then in the morning the people would have gone up every man from following his brother.
\[28]So Joab blew the trumpet. And all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither did they fight any more.
\[29]And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah, and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.
\[30]And Joab returned from following Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.
\[31]But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and sixty men died.
\[32]And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulcher of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.

ow there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. And David grew stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.
\[2]And sons were born to David in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess,
\[3]and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite, and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur,
\[4]and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith, and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital,
\[5]and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
\[6]And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.
\[7]Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Why have thou gone in to my father's concubine?
\[8]Then Abner was very angry for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah? This day I show kindness to the house of Saul thy father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, and yet thou charge me this day with a fault concerning this woman.
\[9]God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Jehovah has sworn to David, I do not even so to him,
\[10]to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.
\[11]And he could not answer Abner another word because he feared him.
\[12]And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? And saying, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee to bring about all Israel to thee.
\[13]And he said, Well! I will make a league with thee, but one thing I require of thee. That is, thou shall not see my face unless thou first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when thou come to see my face.
\[14]And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, Deliver to me my wife Michal whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
\[15]And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.
\[16]And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, Go, return, and he returned.
\[17]And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past ye sought for David to be king over you.
\[18]Now then do it, for Jehovah has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
\[19]And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin. And Abner also went to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.
\[20]So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast.
\[21]And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou may reign over all that thy soul desires. And David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.
\[22]And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them, but Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.
\[23]When Joab and all the army that was with him came, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace.
\[24]Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have thou done? Behold, Abner came to thee. Why is it that thou have sent him away, and he is quite gone?
\[25]Thou know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou do.
\[26]And when Joab came out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah, but David knew it not.
\[27]And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
\[28]And afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner.
\[29]Let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father's house. And let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has an issue, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.
\[30]So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
\[31]And David said to Joab, and to all the people who were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier.
\[32]And they buried Abner in Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.
\[33]And the king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a fool dies?
\[34]Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters. As a man falls before the sons of iniquity, so did thou fall. And all the people wept again over him.
\[35]And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day, but David swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, till the sun is down.
\[36]And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them, as whatever the king did pleased all the people.
\[37]So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner.
\[38]And the king said to his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
\[39]And I am this day weak, though anointed king, and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me. Jehovah reward the evildoer according to his wickedness.

\[2]And Saul's son had two men who were captains of bands. The name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin, for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin.
\[3]And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day.
\[4]Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled. And it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
\[5]And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon.
\[6]And they came there into the midst of the house as though they would have fetched wheat, and they smote him in the body. And Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
\[7]Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they smote him, and killed him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.
\[8]And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, thine enemy, who sought thy life. And Jehovah has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.
\[9]And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As Jehovah lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
\[10]when he who told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good news, I took hold of him, and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.
\[11]How much more, when evil men have slain a righteous man in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
\[12]And David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.

hen all the tribes of Israel came to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
\[2]In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou who led out and brought in Israel. And Jehovah said to thee, Thou shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shall be prince over Israel.
\[3]So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron. And king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah, and they anointed David king over Israel.
\[4]David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
\[5]In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.
\[6]And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, Unless thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shall not come in here, thinking, David cannot come in here.
\[7]Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.
\[8]And David said on that day, Whoever smites the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and smite the lame and the blind, the hated by David's soul, because the blind and the lame say, He cannot come into the house.
\[9]And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.
\[10]And David grew greater and greater, for Jehovah, the God of hosts, was with him.
\[11]And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons, and they built David a house.
\[12]And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.
\[13]And David took for him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron, and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
\[14]And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
\[15]and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
\[16]and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.
\[17]And when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.
\[18]Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\[19]And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said to David, Go up, for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
\[20]And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there. And he said, Jehovah has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
\[21]And they left their images there, and David and his men took them away.
\[22]And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\[23]And when David inquired of Jehovah, he said, Thou shall not go up. Make a circuit behind them, and come upon them opposite the mulberry trees.
\[24]And it shall be, when thou hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shall bestir thyself, for then Jehovah has gone out before thee to smite the army of the Philistines.
\[25]And David did so, as Jehovah commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer.

nd David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
\[2]And David arose, and went with all the people who were with him, from Baale-judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of Jehovah of hosts who sits above the cherubim.
\[3]And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was on the hill. And Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.
\[4]And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill, with the ark of God, and Ahio went before the ark.
\[5]And David and all the house of Israel played before Jehovah with all manner of instruments of fir-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with castanets, and with cymbals.
\[6]And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth to the ark of God, and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled.
\[7]And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him there for his error, and he died there by the ark of God.
\[8]And David was displeased, because Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzzah. And he called that place Perez-uzzah, to this day.
\[9]And David was afraid of Jehovah that day, and he said, How shall the ark of Jehovah come to me?
\[10]So David would not remove the ark of Jehovah to him into the city of David, but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
\[11]And the ark of Jehovah remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months, and Jehovah blessed Obed-edom, and all his house.
\[12]And it was told king David, saying, Jehovah has blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God. And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy.
\[13]And it was so, that, when those who bore the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.
\[14]And David danced before Jehovah with all his might. And David was girded with a linen ephod.
\[15]So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Jehovah with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
\[16]And it was so, as the ark of Jehovah came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Jehovah, and she despised him in her heart.
\[17]And they brought in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it. And David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Jehovah.
\[18]And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of hosts.
\[19]And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a portion of flesh, and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed every one to his house.
\[20]Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!
\[21]And David said to Michal, It was before Jehovah, who chose me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of Jehovah, over Israel. Therefore I will play before Jehovah.
\[22]And I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in my own sight, but of the handmaids of whom thou have spoken, of them I shall be had in honor.

\[2]that the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.
\[3]And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart, for Jehovah is with thee.
\[4]And it came to pass the same night, that the word of Jehovah came to Nathan, saying,
\[5]Go and tell my servant David, Thus says Jehovah, Shall thou build a house for me to dwell in?
\[6]For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the sons of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.
\[7]In all places in which I have walked with all the sons of Israel, did I speak a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built for me a house of cedar?
\[8]Now therefore thus thou shall say to my servant David, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepfold, from following the sheep, that thou should be prince over my people, over Israel.
\[9]And I have been with thee wherever thou went, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee. And I will make thee a great name, like the name of the great ones that are on the earth.
\[10]And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more. Neither shall the sons of iniquity afflict them any more, as at the first,
\[11]and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. Moreover Jehovah tells thee that Jehovah will make thee a house.
\[12]When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shall sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
\[13]He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
\[14]I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men,
\[15]but my loving kindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul whom I put away before thee.
\[16]And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure forever before thee; thy throne shall be established forever.
\[17]According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
\[18]Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah. And he said, Who am I, O lord Jehovah, and what is my house, that thou have brought me thus far?
\[19]And this was yet a small thing in thine eyes, O lord Jehovah, but thou have spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and this too according to the manner of men, O lord Jehovah!
\[20]And what can David say more to thee? For thou know thy servant, O lord Jehovah.
\[21]For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, thou have wrought all this greatness, to make thy servant know it.
\[22]Therefore thou are great, O Jehovah God, for there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
\[23]And what one nation on the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, and to make him a name, and to do great things for you, and awesome things for thy land, before thy people whom thou redeemed to thee out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods?
\[24]And thou established to thyself thy people Israel to be a people to thee forever, and thou, Jehovah, became their God.
\[25]And now, O Jehovah God, the word that thou have spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm it forever, and do as thou have spoken.
\[26]And let thy name be magnified forever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is God over Israel, and the house of thy servant David shall be established before thee.
\[27]For thou, O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, have revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house. Therefore thy servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to thee.
\[28]And now, O lord Jehovah, thou are God, and thy words are truth, and thou have promised this good thing to thy servant.
\[29]Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue forever before thee, for thou, O lord Jehovah, have spoken it. And with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed forever.

\[10]And thou shall till the land for him, thou, and thy sons, and thy servants. And thou shall bring in the fruits that thy master's son may have bread to eat, but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall always eat bread at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
\[11]Then Ziba said to the king, According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, the king said, he shall eat at my table as one of the king's sons.
\[12]And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all who dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.
\[13]So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem, for he ate continually at the king's table. And he was lame in both his feet.

nd it came to pass after this, that the king of the sons of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
\[2]And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me. So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the sons of Ammon.
\[3]But the rulers of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Think thou that David honors thy father, in that he has sent comforters to thee? Has not David sent his servants to thee to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
\[4]So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
\[5]When they told it to David, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
\[6]And when the sons of Ammon saw that they had become odious to David, the sons of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men.
\[7]And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men.
\[8]And the sons of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate. And the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.
\[9]Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him in front and behind, he chose from all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.
\[10]And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother. And he put them in array against the sons of Ammon.
\[11]And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shall help me, but if the sons of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.
\[12]Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God. And Jehovah do that which seems good to him.
\[13]So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians. And they fled before him.
\[14]And when the sons of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the sons of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
\[15]And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together.
\[16]And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River, and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadarezer at their head.
\[17]And it was told David. And he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
\[18]And the Syrians fled before Israel. And David killed of the Syrians the men of seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their army so that he died there.
\[19]And when all the kings who were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians were afraid to help the sons of Ammon any more.

nd it came to pass, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel. And they destroyed the sons of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.
\[2]And it came to pass at evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house. And from the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.
\[3]And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
\[4]And David sent messengers, and took her. And she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness), and she returned to her house.
\[5]And the woman conceived. And she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.
\[6]And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.
\[7]And when Uriah came to him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.
\[8]And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and a gift from the king followed him.
\[9]But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.
\[10]And when they had told David, saying, Uriah did not go down to his house, David said to Uriah, Have thou not come from a journey? Why did thou not go down to thy house?
\[11]And Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths, and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As thou live, and as thy soul lives, I will not do this thing.
\[12]And David said to Uriah, Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.
\[13]And when David had called him, he ate and drank before him, and he made him drunk. And at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but did not go down to his house.
\[14]And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
\[15]And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.
\[16]And it came to pass, when Joab kept watch upon the city, that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.
\[17]And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab. And there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David, and Uriah the Hittite died also.
\[18]Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war.
\[19]And he charged the messenger, saying, When thou have made an end of telling all the things concerning the war to the king,
\[20]it shall be that, if the king's wrath arise, and he says to thee, Why did ye go so near to the city to fight? Did ye not know that they would shoot from the wall?
\[21]Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall so that he died at Thebez? Why did ye go so near the wall? Then thou shall say, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
\[22]So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Joab had sent him.
\[23]And the messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were upon them even to the entrance of the gate.
\[24]And the shooters shot at thy servants from off the wall. And some of the king's servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
\[25]Then David said to the messenger, Thus thou shall say to Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make thy battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it. And encourage thou him.
\[26]And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.
\[27]And when the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Jehovah.

nd Jehovah sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city: the one rich, and the other poor.
\[2]The rich man had exceedingly many flocks and herds,
\[3]but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up. And it grew up together with him, and with his sons. It ate of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.
\[4]And there came a traveler to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man who came to him, but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man who came to him.
\[5]And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah lives, the man who has done this is worthy to die.
\[6]And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
\[7]And Nathan said to David, Thou are the man. Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul.
\[8]And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah. And if that had been too little, I would have added to thee such and such things.
\[9]Why have thou despised the word of Jehovah, to do that which is evil in his sight? Thou have smitten Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be thy wife, and have slain him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.
\[10]Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because thou have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.
\[11]Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house. And I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them to thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
\[12]For thou did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
\[13]And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said to David, Jehovah also has put away thy sin; thou shall not die.
\[14]However, because by this deed thou have given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, the child also that is born to thee shall surely die.
\[15]And Nathan departed to his house. And Jehovah struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and it was very sick.
\[16]David therefore besought God for the child. And David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the ground.
\[17]And the elders of his house arose, and stood beside him, to raise him up from the ground, but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
\[18]And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive we spoke to him, and he did not hearken to our voice, how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead!
\[19]But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead. And David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
\[20]Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel. And he came into the house of Jehovah, and worshiped. Then he came to his own house, and when he required, they set bread before him, and he ate.
\[21]Then his servants said to him, What thing is this that thou have done? Thou fasted and wept for the child while it was alive, but when the child was dead, thou arose and ate bread.
\[22]And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept. For I said, Who knows whether Jehovah will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?
\[23]But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.
\[24]And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her. And she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And Jehovah loved him,
\[25]and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet. And he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah's sake.
\[26]Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and took the royal city.
\[27]And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah; yea, I have taken the city of waters.
\[28]Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it, lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
\[29]And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
\[30]And he took the crown of their king from off his head. And the weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones. And it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceedingly much.
\[31]And he brought forth the people that were in it, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln. And thus he did to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

nd it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister whose name was Tamar. And Amnon the son of David loved her.
\[2]And Amnon was so frustrated that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar. For she was a virgin, and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.
\[3]But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother. And Jonadab was a very sly man.
\[4]And he said to him, Why, O son of the king, are thou emaciated this way from day to day? Will thou not tell me? And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
\[5]And Jonadab said to him, Lie down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick. And when thy father comes to see thee, say to him, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.
\[6]So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick. And when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.
\[7]Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and make food for him.
\[8]So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, and he was laid down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.
\[9]And she took the pan, and poured them out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have all men out from me. And they went out every man from him.
\[10]And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes that she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
\[11]And when she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.
\[12]And she answered him, No, my brother, do not force me, for no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Do not do thou this folly.
\[13]And I, where shall I carry my shame? And as for thee, thou will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from thee.
\[14]However he would not hearken to her voice, but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.
\[15]Then Amnon hated her with exceedingly great hatred, for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.
\[16]And she said to him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is worse than the other that thou did to me. But he would not hearken to her.
\[17]Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, Put this woman out from me now, and bolt the door after her.
\[18]And she had a garment of various colors upon her, for with such robes were the king's daughters who were virgins appareled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
\[19]And Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her. And she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.
\[20]And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon thy brother been with thee? But now hold thy peace, my sister. He is thy brother. Do not take this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
\[21]But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.
\[22]And Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad, for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
\[23]And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
\[24]And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant has sheep-shearers. Let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.
\[25]And the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to thee. And he pressed him. However he would not go, but blessed him.
\[26]Then Absalom said, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with thee?
\[27]But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
\[28]And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Notice ye now, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Smite Amnon, then kill him. Fear not; have I not commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant.
\[29]And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got up upon his mule, and fled.
\[30]And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the news came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.
\[31]Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth, and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.
\[32]And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons, for Amnon only is dead. For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
\[33]Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead, for only Amnon is dead.
\[34]But Absalom fled. And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him.
\[35]And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons have come; as thy servant said, so it is.
\[36]And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept. And the king also and all his servants wept very much.
\[37]But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.
\[38]So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
\[39]And the soul of king David longed to go forth to Absalom, for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

ow Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.
\[2]And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched from there a wise woman, and said to her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and do not anoint thyself with oil, but be as a woman who has a long time mourned for the dead.
\[3]And go in to the king, and speak on this manner to him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.
\[4]And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.
\[5]And the king said to her, What troubles thee? And she answered, Of a truth I am a widow, and my husband is dead.
\[6]And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him.
\[7]And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they say, Deliver him who smote his brother that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed, and so destroy the heir also. Thus they will quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth.
\[8]And the king said to the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.
\[9]And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house, and the king and his throne be guiltless.
\[10]And the king said, Whoever says anything to thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
\[11]Then she said, I pray thee, let the king remember Jehovah thy God, that the avenger of blood not destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As Jehovah lives, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.
\[12]Then the woman said, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word to my lord the king. And he said, Say on.
\[13]And the woman said, Why then have thou devised such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as he who is guilty, in that the king does not fetch home again his banished one.
\[14]For we must die, and are as water split on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again, neither does God take away life, but devises means that he who is banished be not an outcast from him.
\[15]Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid. And thy handmaid said, I will now speak to the king. It may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.
\[16]For the king will hear to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
\[17]Then thy handmaid said, Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be gracious, for as an agent of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad. And Jehovah thy God be with thee.
\[18]Then the king answered and said to the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, anything that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.
\[19]And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul lives, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken, for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid.
\[20]Thy servant Joab has done this thing to change the face of the matter. And my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an agent of God, to know all things that are on the earth.
\[21]And the king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing. Go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.
\[22]And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king. And Joab said, Today thy servant knows that I have found favor in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant.
\[23]So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
\[24]And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house, and did not see the king's face.
\[25]Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty; from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
\[26]And when he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year's end that he cut it, because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king's weight.
\[27]And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a woman of a fair countenance.
\[28]And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and he did not see the king's face.
\[29]Then Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. And he sent again a second time, but he would not come.
\[30]Therefore he said to his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
\[31]Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said to him, Why have thy servants set my field on fire?
\[32]And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to thee, saying, Come here, that I may send thee to the king to say, Why have I come from Geshur? It were better for me to still be there. Now therefore let me see the king's face, and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.
\[33]So Joab came to the king, and told him. And when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.

nd it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared for him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
\[2]And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate. And it was so, that, when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city are thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
\[3]And Absalom said to him, See, thy matters are good and right, but there is no man appointed by the king to hear thee.
\[4]Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or case might come to me, and I would do for him justice!
\[5]And it was so, that, when any man came near to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.
\[6]And on this manner Absalom did to all Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
\[7]And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said to the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to Jehovah, in Hebron.
\[8]For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Jehovah.
\[9]And the king said to him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.
\[10]But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron.
\[11]And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem who were invited, and went in their simplicity. And they did not know anything.
\[12]And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong, for the people increased continually with Absalom.
\[13]And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
\[14]And David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee, for otherwise none of us shall escape from Absalom. Make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
\[15]And the king's servants said to the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king shall choose.
\[16]And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house.
\[17]And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and they remained in Beth-merhak.
\[18]And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
\[19]Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why do thou also go with us? Return, and abide with the king, for thou are a foreigner, and also an exile. Return to thine own place.
\[20]Whereas thou came but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go where I may? Return thou, and take back thy brothers. Mercy and truth be with thee.
\[21]And Ittai answered the king, and said, As Jehovah lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there thy servant will also be.
\[22]And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.
\[23]And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over. The king himself also passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness.
\[24]And, lo, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar went up until all the people had finished passing out of the city.
\[25]And the king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city. If I shall find favor in the eyes of Jehovah he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation.
\[26]But if he says thus, I have no delight in thee, behold, here I am. Let him do to me as seems good to him.
\[27]The king said also to Zadok the priest, Are thou not a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
\[28]See, I will remain at the fords of the wilderness until there comes word from you to report to me.
\[29]Therefore Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem, and they abode there.
\[30]And David went up by the ascent of the mount of Olives, and wept as he went up, and he had his head covered, and went barefoot. And all the people who were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
\[31]And it was told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Jehovah, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
\[32]And it came to pass, that, when David came to the top of the ascent, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn, and dirt upon his head.
\[33]And David said to him, If thou pass on with me, then thou will be a burden to me,
\[34]but if thou return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king. As I have been thy father's servant in time past, so I will now be thy servant, then thou will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.
\[35]And have thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? Therefore it shall be, that whatever thing thou shall hear out of the king's house, thou shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
\[36]Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son. And by them ye shall send to me everything that ye shall hear.
\[37]So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.

nd when David was a little past the top of the ascent, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of saddled donkeys, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
\[2]And the king said to Ziba, What do thou mean by these? And Ziba said, The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.
\[3]And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem, for he said, Today the house of Israel will restore for me the kingdom of my father.
\[4]Then the king said to Ziba, Behold, all that pertains to Mephibosheth is thine. And Ziba said, I do obeisance. Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, O king.
\[5]And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out from there a man of the family of the house of Saul whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out, cursing as he came.
\[6]And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
\[7]And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow.
\[8]Jehovah has returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul in whose stead thou have reigned. And Jehovah has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son, and, behold, thou are taken in thine own mischief because thou are a man of blood.
\[9]Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.
\[10]And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because Jehovah has said to him, Curse David, who then shall say, Why have thou done so?
\[11]And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeks my life. How much more this Benjamite? Let him alone, and let him curse, for Jehovah has bidden him.
\[12]It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done to me, and that Jehovah will reward me good for his cursing of me this day.
\[13]So David and his men went by the way, and Shimei went along on the hill-side opposite him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
\[14]And the king, and all the people who were with him, came weary, and he refreshed himself there.
\[15]And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
\[16]And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, Live, O king. Live, O king.
\[17]And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? Why did thou not go with thy friend?
\[18]And Hushai said to Absalom, No, but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him I will abide.
\[19]And again, whom should I serve? Is it not in the presence of his son? As I have served in thy father's presence, so I will be in thy presence.
\[20]Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.
\[21]And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to thy father's concubines that he has left to keep the house, and all Israel will hear that thou are abhorred by thy father. Then the hands of all who are with thee will be strong.
\[22]So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
\[23]And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.

oreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night.
\[2]And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid. And all the people who are with him shall flee. And I will only smite the king,
\[3]and I will bring back all the people to thee. The man whom thou seek is as if all returned, so all the people shall be in peace.
\[4]And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
\[5]Then Absalom said, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says.
\[6]And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner. Shall we do after his saying? If not, speak thou.
\[7]And Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.
\[8]Hushai said moreover, Thou know thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field. And thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
\[9]Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place. And it will come to pass, when some of them are fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.
\[10]And even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt, for all Israel knows that thy father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.
\[11]But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude, and that thou go to battle in thine own person.
\[12]So we shall come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falls on the ground, and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one.
\[13]Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river until there be not one small stone found there.
\[14]And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Jehovah had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom.
\[15]Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and thus have I counseled.
\[16]Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Do not lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over, lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.
\[17]Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En-rogel. And a maid-servant used to go and tell them, and they went and told king David, for they might not be seen to come into the city.
\[18]But a lad saw them, and told Absalom. And they went away quickly, both of them, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim who had a well in his court, and they went down there.
\[19]And the woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground grain on it. And nothing was known.
\[20]And Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, They have gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
\[21]And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David. And they said to David, Arise ye, and pass quickly over the water, for thus Ahithophel has counseled against you.
\[22]Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan. By the morning light there lacked not one of them who was not gone over the Jordan.
\[23]And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, and arose, and got home to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself. And he died, and was buried in the sepulcher of his father.
\[24]Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
\[25]And Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
\[26]And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
\[27]And it came to pass, when David came to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
\[28]brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and roasted grain, and beans, and lentils, and roasted pulse,
\[29]and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat. For they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.

nd David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
\[2]And David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
\[3]But the people said, Thou shall not go forth. For if we flee away, they will not care for us, neither if half of us die, will they care for us, but thou are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore now it is better that thou be ready to help us out of the city.
\[4]And the king said to them, What seems best to you I will do. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.
\[5]And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
\[6]So the people went out into the field against Israel, and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.
\[7]And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.
\[8]For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
\[9]And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak. And he was taken up between sky and earth, and the mule that was under him went on.
\[10]And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.
\[11]And Joab said to the man who told him, and, behold, thou saw it, and why did thou not smite him there to the ground? And I would have given thee ten pieces of silver, and a belt.
\[12]And the man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, yet I would not put forth my hand against the king's son, for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.
\[13]Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hid from the king), then thou thyself would have set thyself against me.
\[14]Then Joab said, I will not delay thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
\[15]And ten young men who bore Joab's armor encompassed about and smote Absalom, and killed him.
\[16]And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel, for Joab held back the people.
\[17]And they took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. And all Israel fled every man to his tent.
\[18]Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar which is in the king's valley, for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance. And he called the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom's monument to this day.
\[19]Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, Let me now run, and bear the king news, how that Jehovah has avenged him of his enemies.
\[20]And Joab said to him, Thou shall not be the bearer of news this day, but thou shall bear news another day. But this day thou shall bear no news, because the king's son is dead.
\[21]Then Joab said to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what thou have seen. And the Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.
\[22]Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Why will thou run, my son, seeing that thou will have no reward for the news?
\[23]But come what may, he said, I will run. And he said to him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.
\[24]Now David was sitting between the two gates. And the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.
\[25]And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he is alone, there is news in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.
\[26]And the watchman saw another man running. And the watchman called to the porter, and said, Behold, another man running alone. And the king said, He also brings news.
\[27]And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and comes with good news.
\[28]And Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well. And he bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
\[29]And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, even me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.
\[30]And the king said, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.
\[31]And, behold, the Cushite came. And the Cushite said, News for my lord the king, for Jehovah has avenged thee this day of all those who rose up against thee.
\[32]And the king said to the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And the Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.
\[33]And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!

nd it was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.
\[2]And the victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people, for the people heard say that day, The king grieves for his son.
\[3]And the people slipped away that day into the city, as people who are ashamed sneak away when they flee in battle.
\[4]And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!
\[5]And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou have shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines,
\[6]in that thou love those who hate thee, and hate those who love thee. For thou have declared this day that rulers and servants are nothing to thee. For this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it would have pleased thee well.
\[7]Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak graciously to thy servants. For I swear by Jehovah, if thou do not go forth, there will not remain a man with thee this night. And that will be worse to thee than all the evil that has befallen thee from thy youth until now.
\[8]Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told to all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate. And all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.
\[9]And all the people were contending throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines. And now he fled out of the land from Absalom.
\[10]And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?
\[11]And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? Since the speech of all Israel has come to the king, to bring him to his house.
\[12]Ye are my brothers, ye are my bone and my flesh. Why then are ye the last to bring back the king?
\[13]And say ye to Amasa, Are thou not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou not be captain of the army before me continually in the place of Joab.
\[14]And he inclined the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man, so that they sent to the king, saying, Return thou, and all thy servants.
\[15]So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.
\[16]And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hastened and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
\[17]And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him. And they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king.
\[18]And there went over a ferry-boat to bring over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king when he came over the Jordan.
\[19]And he said to the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity to me, neither remember thou that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.
\[20]For thy servant knows that I have sinned. Therefore, behold, I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.
\[21]But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Jehovah's anointed?
\[22]And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries to me? Shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? For do I not know that I am this day king over Israel?
\[23]And the king said to Shimei, Thou shall not die. And the king swore to him.
\[24]And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king. And he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace.
\[25]And it came to pass, when he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why did thou not go with me, Mephibosheth?
\[26]And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. For thy servant said, I will saddle for me a donkey, that I may ride on it, and go with the king, because thy servant is lame.
\[27]And he has slandered thy servant to my lord the king. But my lord the king is as an agent of God; do therefore what is good in thine eyes.
\[28]For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king. Yet thou set thy servant among those who ate at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more to the king?
\[29]And the king said to him, Why do thou speak any more of thy matters? I say, thou and Ziba divide the land.
\[30]And Mephibosheth said to the king, Yea, let him take all, inasmuch as my lord the king has come in peace to his own house.
\[31]And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim. And he went over the Jordan with the king to conduct him over the Jordan.
\[32]Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old. And he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man of wealth.
\[33]And the king said to Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will sustain thee with me in Jerusalem.
\[34]And Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years of my life that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
\[35]I am this day eighty years old. Can I discern between good and bad? Can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should thy servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?
\[36]Thy servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king, and why should the king recompense it to me with such a reward?
\[37]Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in my own city by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, thy servant Chimham, let him go over with my lord the king, and do to him what shall seem good to thee.
\[38]And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to thee. And whatever thou shall require of me, that I will do for thee.
\[39]And all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over. And the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him, and he returned to his own place.
\[40]So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him. And all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel.
\[41]And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen thee away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?
\[42]And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us. Why then are ye angry for this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king's cost, or has he given us any gift?
\[43]And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye. Why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be had first in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.

nd there happened to be there a base fellow whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite. And he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to his tents, O Israel.
\[2]So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri, but the men of Judah clung to their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.
\[3]And David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and provided them with sustenance, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.
\[4]Then the king said to Amasa, Call the men of Judah together to me within three days, and be thou here present.
\[5]So Amasa went to call the men of Judah together, but he delayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
\[6]And David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom. Take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.
\[7]And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men. And they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
\[8]When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and on it was a belt with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath of it. And as he went forth it fell out.
\[9]And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with thee, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
\[10]But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand. So he smote him with it in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again, and he died. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
\[11]And there stood by him one of Joab's young men, and said, He who favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab.
\[12]And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.
\[13]When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
\[14]And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth-maacah, and all the Berites. And they were gathered together, and also went after him.
\[15]And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart. And all the people who were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
\[16]Then a wise woman out of the city cried out, Hear, hear. Say, I pray you, to Joab, Come near here, that I may speak with thee.
\[17]And he came near to her, and the woman said, Are thou Joab? And he answered, I am. Then she said to him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.
\[18]Then she spoke, saying, They were accustomed to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel, and so they ended the matter.
\[19]I am of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel. Thou seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why will thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?
\[20]And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me that I should swallow up or destroy.
\[21]The matter is not so, but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David. Deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
\[22]Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. And he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
\[23]Now Joab was over all the army of Israel, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites,
\[24]and Adoram was over the men subject to task work, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder,
\[25]and Sheva was scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests,
\[26]and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David.

nd there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of Jehovah. And Jehovah said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.
\[2]And the king called the Gibeonites, and spoke to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the sons of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites, and the sons of Israel had sworn to them, and yet Saul sought to kill them in his zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah),
\[3]and David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make atonement that ye may bless the inheritance of Jehovah?
\[4]And the Gibeonites said to him, It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul or his house, neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that I will do for you.
\[5]And they said to the king, The man who consumed us, and who devised against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,
\[6]let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to Jehovah in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Jehovah. And the king said, I will give them.
\[7]But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Jehovah's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
\[8]But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth, and the five sons of Merab the daughter of Saul whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
\[9]And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites. And they hanged them in the mountain before Jehovah, and they fell all seven together. And they were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.
\[10]And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured upon them from heaven. And she neither allowed the birds of the heaven to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
\[11]And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
\[12]And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan where the Philistines had hanged them in the day that the Philistines killed Saul in Gilboa,
\[13]and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son, and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged.
\[14]And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the sepulcher of Kish his father. And they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.
\[15]And the Philistines had war again with Israel. And David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. And David grew faint,
\[16]and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.
\[17]But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, Thou shall no more go out with us to battle, that thou not quench the lamp of Israel.
\[18]And it came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was of the sons of the giant.
\[19]And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob. And Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
\[20]And there was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature who had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, twenty-four in number, and he also was born to the giant.
\[21]And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother, killed him.
\[22]These four were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

nd David spoke to Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:
\[2]And he said, Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine.
\[3]God, my rock, in him I will take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my savior. Thou save me from violence.
\[4]I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised. So I shall be saved from my enemies.
\[5]For the waves of death encompassed me. The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
\[6]The cords of Sheol were round about me. The snares of death came upon me.
\[7]In my distress I called upon Jehovah. Yea, I called to my God. And he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came into his ears.
\[8]Then the earth shook and trembled, the foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken, because he was angry.
\[9]There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured. Coals were kindled by it.
\[10]He bowed the heavens also, and came down, and thick darkness was under his feet.
\[11]And he rode upon a cherub, and flew. Yea, he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
\[12]And he made darkness pavilions round about him, gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
\[13]At the brightness before him coals of fire were kindled.
\[14]Jehovah thundered from heaven, and the Most High uttered his voice.
\[15]And he sent out arrows, and scattered them, lightning, and discomfited them.
\[16]Then the channels of the sea appeared. The foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of Jehovah, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
\[17]He sent from on high, he took me. He drew me out of many waters.
\[18]He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
\[19]They came upon me in the day of my calamity, but Jehovah was my support.
\[20]He brought me forth also into a large place. He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
\[21]Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness. According to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.
\[22]For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
\[23]For all his ordinances were before me. And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.
\[24]I was also perfect toward him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.
\[25]Therefore Jehovah has recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in his eyesight.
\[26]With the merciful thou will show thyself merciful. With the perfect man thou will show thyself perfect.
\[27]With the pure thou will show thyself pure. And with the perverse thou will show thyself contrary.
\[28]And the afflicted people thou will save, but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou may bring them down.
\[29]For thou are my lamp, O Jehovah. And Jehovah will lighten my darkness.
\[30]For by thee I run upon a troop. By my God do I leap over a wall.
\[31]As for God, his way is perfect. The word of Jehovah is tried. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.
\[32]For who is God, except Jehovah? And who is a rock, except our God?
\[33]God is my strong fortress, and he guides the perfect in his way.
\[34]He makes his feet like hinds' feet, and sets me upon my high places.
\[35]He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of brass.
\[36]Thou have also given me the shield of thy salvation, and thy gentleness has made me great.
\[37]Thou have enlarged my steps under me, and my feet have not slipped.
\[38]I have pursued my enemies, and destroyed them, neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
\[39]And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, so that they cannot arise. Yea, they are fallen under my feet.
\[40]For thou have girded me with strength to the battle. Thou have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
\[41]Thou have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me.
\[42]They looked, but there was none to save; even to Jehovah, but he did not answer them.
\[43]Then I beat them small as the dust of the earth. I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad.
\[44]Thou have also delivered me from the strivings of my people. Thou have kept me to be the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known shall serve me.
\[45]The foreigners shall submit themselves to me. As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me.
\[46]The foreigners shall fade away, and shall come trembling out of their hiding places.
\[47]Jehovah lives. And blessed be my rock. And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,
\[48]Even the God who executes vengeance for me, and who brings down peoples under me,
\[49]and who brings me forth from my enemies. Yea, thou lift me up above those who rise up against me. Thou deliver me from the violent man.
\[50]Therefore I will give thanks to thee, O Jehovah, among gentiles, and will sing praises to thy name.
\[51]He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness to his anointed, to David and to his seed, for evermore.

ow these are the last words of David. David the son of Jesse says, and the man who was raised on high says, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel:
\[2]The Spirit of Jehovah spoke by me, and his word was upon my tongue.
\[3]The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me. He who rules over men righteously, who rules in the fear of God,
\[4]he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun rises, a morning without clouds, when the tender grass springs out of the earth, through clear shining after rain.
\[5]Truly my house is not so with God. Yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure. For it is all my salvation, and all my desire, though he does not make it to grow.
\[6]But the worthless shall be as thorns to be thrust away, all of them, because they cannot be taken with the hand.
\[7]But the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear, and they shall be utterly burned with fire in their place.
\[8]These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains, the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time.
\[9]And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away.
\[10]He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clung to the sword. And Jehovah wrought a great victory that day, and the people returned after him only to take spoil.
\[11]And after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop where was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the people fled from the Philistines.
\[12]But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines. And Jehovah wrought a great victory.
\[13]And three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam, and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
\[14]And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
\[15]And David longed, and said, Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
\[16]And the three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Jehovah.
\[17]And he said, Be it far from me, O Jehovah, that I should do this, to drink the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives? Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.
\[18]And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.
\[19]Was he not most honorable of the three? Therefore he was made their captain. However he did not attain to the first three.
\[20]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.
\[21]And he killed an Egyptian, a good-looking man. And the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.
\[22]These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and had a name among the three mighty men.
\[23]He was more honorable than the thirty, but he did not attain to the first three. And David set him over his guard.
\[24]Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
\[25]Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
\[26]Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
\[27]Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
\[28]Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
\[29]Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin,
\[30]Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash.
\[31]Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
\[32]Eliahba the Shaalbonite (of the sons of Jashen), Jonathan,
\[33]Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,
\[34]Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
\[35]Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
\[36]Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
\[37]Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armorbearers to Joab the son of Zeruiah,
\[38]Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,

nd again the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.
\[2]And the king said to Joab the captain of the army, who was with him, Go now to and fro through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the sum of the people.
\[3]And Joab said to the king, Now Jehovah thy God add to the people, however many they may be, a hundredfold, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it, but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?
\[4]Notwithstanding, the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the army. And Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel.
\[5]And they passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and to Jazer.
\[6]Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi. And they came to Dan-jaan, and round about to Sidon,
\[7]and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites. And they went out to the south of Judah, at Beersheba.
\[8]So when they had gone to and fro through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
\[9]And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to the king. And there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
\[10]And David's heart smote him after he had numbered the people. And David said to Jehovah, I have sinned greatly in that which I have done, but now, O Jehovah, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant, for I have done very foolishly.
\[11]And when David rose up in the morning, the word of Jehovah came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
\[12]Go and speak to David, Thus says Jehovah, I offer thee three things. Choose thee one of them, that I may do it to thee.
\[13]So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come to thee in thy land? Or will thou flee three months before thy foes while they pursue thee? Or shall there be three days' pestilence in thy land? Now decide, and see what answer I shall return to him who sent me.
\[14]And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait. Let us fall now into the hand of Jehovah, for his mercies are great, and let me not fall into the hand of man.
\[15]So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed. And there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.
\[16]And when the agent stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah relented of the evil, and said to the agent who destroyed the people, It is enough. Now stay thy hand. And the agent of Jehovah was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
\[17]And David spoke to Jehovah when he saw the agent who smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done perversely, but these sheep, what have they done? Let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.
\[18]And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
\[19]And David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Jehovah commanded.
\[20]And Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him. And Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
\[21]And Araunah said, Why has my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor from thee, to build an altar to Jehovah that the plague may be halted from the people.
\[22]And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Behold, the oxen for the burnt offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.
\[23]All this, O king, Araunah gives to the king. And Araunah said to the king, Jehovah thy God accept thee.
\[24]And the king said to Araunah, No, but I will truly buy it from thee at a price. Neither will I offer burnt offerings to Jehovah my God which cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
\[25]And David built there an altar to Jehovah, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So Jehovah was entreated for the land, and the plague was halted from Israel.

ow king David was old and stricken in years, and they covered him with clothes, but he did not get warm.
\[2]Therefore his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin. And let her stand before the king, and take care of him. And let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get warmth.
\[3]So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
\[4]And the damsel was very fair. And she took care of the king, and ministered to him, but the king knew her not.
\[5]Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king. And he prepared chariots for him, and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
\[6]And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why have thou done so? And he was also a very handsome man. And he was born after Absalom.
\[7]And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest. And, following Adonijah, they helped him.
\[8]But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
\[9]And Adonijah killed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel. And he called all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants.
\[10]But he did not call Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother.
\[11]Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord does not know it?
\[12]Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou may save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
\[13]Go and get thee in to king David, and say to him, Did thou not, my lord, O king, swear to thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?
\[14]Behold, while thou yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.
\[15]And Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber. And the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king.
\[16]And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What do thou want?
\[17]And she said to him, My lord, thou swore by Jehovah thy God to thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
\[18]And now, behold, Adonijah reigns, and thou, my lord the king, do not know it.
\[19]And he has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army, but he has not called Solomon thy servant.
\[20]And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
\[21]Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be considered offenders.
\[22]And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.
\[23]And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he came in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
\[24]And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
\[25]For he has gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest. And, behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, Live, king Adonijah.
\[26]But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, he has not called.
\[27]Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou have not shown to thy servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
\[28]Then king David answered and said, Call Bathsheba to me. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
\[29]And the king swore, and said, As Jehovah lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
\[30]truly as I swore to thee by Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead. Surely so I will do this day.
\[31]Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live forever.
\[32]And king David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
\[33]And the king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.
\[34]And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel. And blow ye the trumpet, and say, Live, king Solomon.
\[35]Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne, for he shall be king in my stead. And I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.
\[36]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Truly. Jehovah, the God of my lord the king, say so too.
\[37]As Jehovah has been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
\[38]So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.
\[39]And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, Live, king Solomon.
\[40]And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth quivered with the sound of them.
\[41]And Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?
\[42]While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. And Adonijah said, Come in, for thou are a worthy man, and bring good news.
\[43]And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Truly our lord king David has made Solomon king.
\[44]And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites. And they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule.
\[45]And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon. And they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.
\[46]And also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.
\[47]And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.
\[48]And also thus said the king, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who has given one of my seed to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.
\[49]And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and every man went his way.
\[50]And Adonijah feared because of Solomon. And he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
\[51]And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon, for, lo, he has laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword.
\[52]And Solomon said, If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth, but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.
\[53]So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to king Solomon. And Solomon said to him, Go to thy house.

ow the days of David drew near that he should die. And he charged Solomon his son, saying,
\[2]I am going the way of all the earth. Be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man,
\[3]and keep the charge of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that thou may prosper in all that thou do, and wherever thou turn thyself.
\[4]That Jehovah may establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If thy sons take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee a man on the throne of Israel.
\[5]Moreover thou also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, even what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his belt that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.
\[6]Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and do not let his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace.
\[7]But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those who eat at thy table, for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom thy brother.
\[8]And, behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim. But he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by Jehovah, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
\[9]Now therefore do not hold him guiltless, for thou are a wise man, and thou will know what thou ought to do to him, and thou shall bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood.
\[10]And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
\[11]And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
\[12]And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was established greatly.
\[13]Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Do thou come peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.
\[14]He said moreover, I have something to say to thee. And she said, Say on.
\[15]And he said, Thou know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign. However the kingdom is turned about, and has become my brother's, for it was his from Jehovah.
\[16]And now I ask one petition of thee; do not deny me. And she said to him, Say on.
\[17]And he said, Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king (for he will not say no thee), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.
\[18]And Bathsheba said, Well, I will speak for thee to the king.
\[19]Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king's mother. And she sat on his right hand.
\[20]Then she said, I ask one small petition of thee; do not deny me. And the king said to her, Ask on, my mother, for I will not deny thee.
\[21]And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.
\[22]And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why do thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also, for he is my elder brother, even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
\[23]Then king Solomon swore by Jehovah, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life.
\[24]Now therefore as Jehovah lives, who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
\[25]And king Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he fell upon him so that he died.
\[26]And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Get thee to Anathoth, to thine own fields, for thou are worthy of death. But I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou bore the ark of the lord Jehovah before David my father, and because thou were afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
\[27]So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Jehovah, that he might fulfill the word of Jehovah, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
\[28]And the news came to Joab, for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he did not turn after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tent of Jehovah, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
\[29]And it was told king Solomon, Joab has fled to the tent of Jehovah, and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
\[30]And Benaiah came to the tent of Jehovah, and said to him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And he said, No, but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
\[31]And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall upon him, and bury him, that thou may take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father's house.
\[32]And Jehovah will return his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword, and my father David did not know it, namely, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah.
\[33]So shall their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed forever. But to David, and to his seed, and to his house, and to his throne, there shall be peace forever from Jehovah.
\[34]Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and killed him. And he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
\[35]And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the army. And the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.
\[36]And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build for thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth from there anywhere.
\[37]For on the day thou go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, know thou for certain that thou shall surely die; thy blood shall be upon thine own head.
\[38]And Shimei said to the king, The saying is good. As my lord the king has said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
\[39]And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.
\[40]And Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants. And Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.
\[41]And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.
\[42]And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not adjure thee by Jehovah, and protest to thee, saying, Know for certain, that on the day thou go out, and walk abroad anywhere, thou shall surely die? And thou said to me, The saying that I have heard is good.
\[43]Why then have thou not kept the oath of Jehovah, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?
\[44]The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou know all the iniquity which thy heart is privy to, what thou did to David my father. Therefore Jehovah shall return thy iniquity upon thine own head.
\[45]But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Jehovah forever.
\[46]So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And he went out, and fell upon him so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.

nd Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of Jehovah, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
\[2]Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of Jehovah until those days.
\[3]And Solomon loved Jehovah, walking in the statutes of David his father. Only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
\[4]And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings upon that altar.
\[5]In Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
\[6]And Solomon said, Thou have shown to thy servant David my father great loving kindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee. And thou have kept for him this great loving kindness, that thou have given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day.
\[7]And now, O Jehovah my God, thou have made thy servant king instead of David my father. And I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or come in.
\[8]And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou have chosen, a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
\[9]Give thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and evil, for who is able to judge this thy great people?
\[10]And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
\[11]And God said to him, Because thou have asked this thing, and have not asked for thyself long life, neither have asked riches for thyself, nor have asked the life of thine enemies, but have asked for thyself understanding to discern justice,
\[12]behold, I have done according to thy word. Lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart, so that there has been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like thee.
\[13]And I have also given thee that which thou have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like thee all thy days.
\[14]And if thou will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David walked, then I will lengthen thy days.
\[15]And Solomon awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
\[16]Then two women who were harlots came to the king, and stood before him.
\[17]And the one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house. And I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
\[18]And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also. And we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, except we two in the house.
\[19]And this woman's child died in the night, because she lay upon it.
\[20]And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
\[21]And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead. But when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son whom I bore.
\[22]And the other woman said, No, but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And the other woman said, No, but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spoke before the king.
\[23]Then the king said, The one says, This is my son that lives, and thy son is the dead. And the other says, No, but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.
\[24]And the king said, Fetch me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
\[25]And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
\[26]Then the woman whose the living child was spoke to the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and by no means kill it. But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor thine. Divide it.
\[27]Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and by no means kill it; she is the mother of it.
\[28]And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged. And they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice.

\[2]And these were the rulers whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;
\[3]Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;
\[4]and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
\[5]and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister, and the king's friend;
\[6]and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to task work.
\[7]And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel who provided provisions for the king and his household. Each man had to make provision for a month in the year.
\[8]And these are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill-country of Ephraim;
\[9]Ben-deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan;
\[10]Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (to him pertained Socoh, and all the land of Hepher);
\[11]Ben-abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife);
\[12]Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;
\[13]Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; even to him pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and brazen bars);
\[14]Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;

\[18]Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;
\[19]Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan, and he was the only officer who was in the land.
\[20]Judah and Israel were as many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.
\[21]And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. They brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
\[22]And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of meal,
\[23]ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl.
\[24]For he had dominion over all the region on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side of the River. And he had peace on all sides round about him.
\[25]And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.
\[26]And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
\[27]And those officers provided provisions for king Solomon, and for all who came to king Solomon's table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking.
\[28]Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds they brought to the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.
\[29]And God gave Solomon exceedingly much wisdom and understanding, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore.
\[30]And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the sons of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
\[31]For he was wiser than all men: than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame was in all the nations round about.
\[32]And he spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were a thousand and five.
\[33]And he spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall. He spoke also of beasts, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fishes.

nd Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father, for Hiram was ever a devotee of David.
\[2]And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
\[3]Thou know how that David my father could not build a house for the name of Jehovah his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until Jehovah put them under the soles of his feet.
\[4]But now Jehovah my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence.
\[5]And, behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, as Jehovah spoke to David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy place, he shall build the house for my name.
\[6]Now therefore command thou that they cut for me cedar trees out of Lebanon. And my servants shall be with thy servants. And I will give thee wages for thy servants according to all that thou shall say, for thou know that there is not among us any that knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.
\[7]And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be Jehovah this day, who has given to David a wise son over this great people.
\[8]And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard that which thou have sent to me. I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
\[9]My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea. And I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place that thou shall appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and thou shall receive them. And thou shall accomplish my desire in giving food for my household.
\[10]So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire.
\[11]And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil; thus Solomon gave to Hiram year by year.
\[12]And Jehovah gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two made a league together.
\[13]And king Solomon raised a conscription out of all Israel, and the conscription was thirty thousand men.
\[14]And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses. They were in Lebanon a month, and at home two months. And Adoniram was over the men subject to task work.
\[15]And Solomon had seventy thousand who bore burdens, and eighty thousand who were hewers in the mountains,
\[16]besides Solomon's chief officers who were over the work: three thousand and three hundred who bore rule over the people that labored in the work.
\[17]And the king commanded, and they hewed out great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with shaped stone.
\[18]And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites fashioned them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.

nd it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the sons of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of Jehovah.
\[2]And the house which king Solomon built for Jehovah, the length of it was sixty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty, and the height of it thirty cubits,
\[3]and the porch in front of the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, and ten cubits was the breadth of it in front of the house.
\[4]And he made windows of fixed lattice-work for the house.
\[5]And against the wall of the house he built stories round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle. And he made side-chambers round about.
\[6]The lowest story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad, for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.
\[7]And the house, when it was being built, was built of stone made ready at the quarry. And there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was being built.
\[8]The door for the middle side-chambers was in the right side of the house. And they went up by winding stairs into the middle story, and out of the middle into the third.
\[9]So he built the house, and finished it. And he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.
\[10]And he built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
\[11]And the word of Jehovah came to Solomon, saying,
\[12]Concerning this house that thou are building, if thou will walk in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them, then I will establish my word with thee, which I spoke to David thy father.
\[13]And I will dwell among the sons of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
\[14]So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
\[15]And he built the walls of the house inside with boards of cedar. From the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood. And he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir.
\[16]And he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the walls of the ceiling. He built them for it inside, for an oracle, even for the most holy place.
\[17]And the house, that is, the temple in front of the oracle, was forty cubits long.
\[18]And there was cedar on the house inside, carved with knops and open flowers. All was cedar; there was no stone seen.
\[19]And he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house inside, to set there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.
\[20]And inside the oracle was a space of twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height of it. And he overlaid it with pure gold. And he covered the altar with cedar.
\[21]So Solomon overlaid the house inside with pure gold. And he drew chains of gold across before the oracle, and he overlaid it with gold.
\[22]And the whole house he overlaid with gold until all the house was finished. Also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold.
\[23]And in the oracle he made two cherubim of olive-wood, each ten cubits high.
\[24]And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub. From the outermost part of the one wing to the outermost part of the other were ten cubits.
\[25]And the other cherub was ten cubits; both of the cherubim were of one measure and one form.
\[26]The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so it was of the other cherub.
\[27]And he set the cherubim inside the inner house. And the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall. And their wings touched each another in the middle of the house.
\[28]And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
\[29]And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, inside and outside.
\[30]And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, inside and outside.
\[31]And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive-wood. The lintel and door-posts were a fifth part of the wall.
\[32]So he made two doors of olive-wood. And he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold. And he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm trees.
\[33]So he also made for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood out of a fourth part of the wall,
\[34]and two doors of fir-wood. The two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
\[35]And he carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers. And he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work.
\[36]And he built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams.
\[37]In the fourth year the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid, in the month Ziv.
\[38]And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished throughout all the parts of it, and according to all the fashion of it. So he was seven years in building it.

nd Solomon was thirteen years building his own house, and he finished all his house.
\[2]For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon. The length of it was a hundred cubits, and the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.
\[3]And it was covered with cedar above over the forty-five beams that were upon the pillars, fifteen in a row.
\[4]And there were beams in three rows, and window was opposite window in three ranks.
\[5]And all the doors and posts were made square with beams, and window was opposite window in three ranks.
\[6]And he made the porch of pillars. The length of it was fifty cubits, and the breadth of it thirty cubits, and a porch in front of them, and pillars and a threshold in front of them.
\[7]And he made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment. And it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.
\[8]And his house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch was of the like work. He also made a house for Pharaoh's daughter (whom Solomon had taken to wife), like this porch.
\[9]All these were of costly stones, even of hewn stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the great court.
\[10]And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
\[11]And above were costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure, and cedar-wood.
\[12]And the great court round about had three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams, like the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and the porch of the house.
\[13]And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
\[14]He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a workman in brass. And he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
\[15]For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece. And a line of twelve cubits encompassed each of them around.
\[16]And he made two capitals of molten brass to set upon the tops of the pillars. The height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.
\[17]There were nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.
\[18]So he made the pillars. And there were two rows round about upon the one network to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars. And so he did for the other capital.
\[19]And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits.
\[20]And there were capitals also above upon the two pillars, close by the protuberance which was beside the network. And the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about upon the other capital.
\[21]And he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple. And he set up the right pillar, and called the name of it Jachin, and he set up the left pillar, and called the name of it Boaz.
\[22]And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
\[23]And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height of it was five cubits. And a line of thirty cubits encompassed it round about.
\[24]And under the brim of it round about there were knops which encompassed it, for ten cubits, encompassing the sea round about. The knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast.
\[25]It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east. And the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.
\[26]And it was a handbreadth thick. And the brim of it was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held two thousand baths.
\[27]And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth of it, and three cubits the height of it.
\[28]And the work of the bases was on this manner: They had panels, and there were panels between the ledges.
\[29]And on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim. And upon the ledges there was a pedestal above. And beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.
\[30]And every base had four brazen wheels, and axles of brass. And the four corners of it had supports. Beneath the laver were the molten supports with wreaths at the side of each.
\[31]And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit. And the mouth of it was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half. And also upon the mouth of it were engravings. And their panels were foursquare, not round.
\[32]And the four wheels were underneath the panels. And the axletrees of the wheels were in the base. And the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.
\[33]And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel. Their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.
\[34]And there were four supports at the four corners of each base. The supports of it were of the base itself.
\[35]And in the top of the base there was a round band half a cubit high. And on the top of the base the ledges of it and the panels of it were of the same.
\[36]And on the plates of the ledges of it, and on the panels of it, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about.
\[37]After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.
\[38]And he made ten basins of brass. One basin contained forty baths. And every basin was four cubits. And upon every one of the ten bases one basin.
\[39]And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. And he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.
\[40]And Hiram made the basins, and the shovels, and the bowls. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of Jehovah:
\[41]the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,
\[42]and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars,
\[43]and the ten bases, and the ten basins on the bases,
\[44]and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea,
\[45]and the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls. And all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon in the house of Jehovah were of burnished brass.
\[46]The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
\[47]And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed because they were very many; the weight of the brass could not be found out.
\[48]And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Jehovah: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the showbread was, of gold,
\[49]and the lampstands, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold, and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold,
\[50]and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold, and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, namely, of the temple, of gold.
\[51]Thus all the work that king Solomon wrought in the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated-the silver, and the gold, and the vessels-and put them in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah.

hen Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers of the sons of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.
\[2]And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
\[3]And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
\[4]And they brought up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; even these the priests and the Levites brought up.
\[5]And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.
\[6]And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.
\[7]For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves of it above.
\[8]And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle. But they were not seen outside. And there they are to this day.
\[9]There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses put there at Horeb when Jehovah made a covenant with the sons of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
\[10]And it came to pass, when the priests came out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah,
\[11]so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud, for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.
\[12]Then Solomon spoke, Jehovah has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
\[13]I have surely built thee a house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in forever.
\[14]And the king turned his face around, and blessed all the assembly of Israel. And all the assembly of Israel stood.
\[15]And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hand fulfilled it, saying,
\[16]Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there, but I chose David to be over my people Israel.
\[17]Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
\[18]But Jehovah said to David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou did well that it was in thy heart.
\[19]Nevertheless thou shall not build the house, but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.
\[20]And Jehovah has established his word that he spoke, for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
\[21]And there I have set a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
\[22]And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven.
\[23]And he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with thy servants, who walk before thee with all their heart,
\[24]who have kept with thy servant David my father that which thou did promise him. Yea, thou spoke with thy mouth, and have fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.
\[25]Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou have promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy sons take heed to their way, to walk before me as thou have walked before me.
\[26]Now therefore, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spoke to thy servant David my father.
\[27]But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee. How much less this house that I have built!
\[28]Yet have thou respect to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken to the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prays before thee this day,
\[29]that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place whereof thou have said, My name shall be there, to hearken to the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place.
\[30]And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place. Yea, hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and when thou hear, forgive.
\[31]If a man sins against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swears before thine altar in this house,
\[32]then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
\[33]When thy people Israel are smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee, if they turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication to thee in this house,
\[34]then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again to the land which thou gave to their fathers.
\[35]When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee, if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin when thou afflict them,
\[36]then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and send rain upon thy land, which thou have given to thy people for an inheritance.
\[37]If there be famine in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blight, mildew, locust or caterpillar, if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities, whatever plague, whatever sickness there be,
\[38]whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house,
\[39]then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou know (for thou, even thou only, know the hearts of all the sons of men),
\[40]that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gave to our fathers.
\[41]Moreover concerning the foreigner who is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for thy name's sake
\[42](for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy mighty hand, and of thine outstretched arm), when he shall come and pray toward this house,
\[43]hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to thee for, that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as does thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
\[44]If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way thou shall send them, and they pray to Jehovah toward the city which thou have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name,
\[45]then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
\[46]If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sins not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to the land of the enemy, afar off or near,
\[47]yet if they shall rethink themselves in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to thee in the land of those who carried them captive, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have dealt wickedly,
\[48]if they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who carried them captive, and pray to thee toward their land, which thou gave to their fathers, the city which thou have chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name,
\[49]then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling-place, and maintain their case,
\[50]and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions by which they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them
\[51](for they are thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou brought forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron);
\[52]that thine eyes may be open to the supplication of thy servant, and to the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken to them whenever they cry to thee.
\[53]For thou separated them from among all the peoples of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spoke by Moses thy servant when thou brought our fathers out of Egypt, O lord Jehovah.
\[54]And it was so, that, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to Jehovah, he arose from before the altar of Jehovah, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven.
\[55]And he stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
\[56]Blessed be Jehovah, who has given rest to his people Israel according to all that he promised. There has not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by Moses his servant.
\[57]Jehovah our God be with us as he was with our fathers. Let him not leave us, nor forsake us,
\[58]that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers.
\[59]And let these my words, with which I have made supplication before Jehovah, be near to Jehovah our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel, as every day shall require,
\[60]that all the peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah, he is God; there is none else.
\[61]Let your heart therefore be perfect with Jehovah our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.
\[62]And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Jehovah.
\[63]And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to Jehovah, twenty-two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the sons of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah.
\[64]The same day the king hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah, for there he offered the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brazen altar that was before Jehovah was too little to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings.
\[65]So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.
\[66]On the eighth day he sent the people away. And they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Jehovah had shown to David his servant, and to Israel his people.

nd it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Jehovah, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,
\[2]that Jehovah appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.
\[3]And Jehovah said to him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, which thou have made before me. I have hallowed this house, which thou have built, to put my name there forever. And my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
\[4]And as for thee, if thou will walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances,
\[5]then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel forever, according as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.
\[6]But if ye shall turn away from following me, ye or your sons, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them,
\[7]then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them. And this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight. And Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
\[8]And though this house is so high, yet shall every man who passes by it be astonished, and shall hiss. And they shall say, Why has Jehovah done thus to this land, and to this house?
\[9]and they shall answer, Because they forsook Jehovah their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them, and served them; therefore has Jehovah brought all this evil upon them.
\[10]And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Jehovah and the king's house
\[11](now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), that king Solomon then gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
\[12]And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him. And they did not please him.
\[13]And he said, What cities are these which thou have given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul to this day.
\[14]And Hiram sent to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.
\[15]And this is the reason for the conscription which king Solomon raised: to build the house of Jehovah, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
\[16]Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites who dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion to his daughter, Solomon's wife.
\[17]And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,
\[18]and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,
\[19]and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
\[20]As for all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the sons of Israel,
\[21]their sons who were left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them Solomon raised a conscription of bondservants to this day.
\[22]But of the sons of Israel Solomon made no bondservants, but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his rulers, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.
\[23]These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people that labored in the work.
\[24]But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her. Then he built Millo.
\[25]And three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built to Jehovah, burning incense therewith, upon the altar that was before Jehovah. So he finished the house.
\[26]And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
\[27]And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen who had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
\[28]And they came to Ophir, and fetched gold from there, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.

nd when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Jehovah, she came to prove him with hard questions.
\[2]And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she conversed with him of all that was in her heart.
\[3]And Solomon answered to her all her questions; there was not anything hid from the king which he did not answer.
\[4]And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
\[5]and the food of his table, and the seating of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Jehovah, there was no more spirit in her.
\[6]And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.
\[7]However I did not believe the words until I came, and my eyes had seen it. And, behold, the half was not told me; thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.
\[8]Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, who hear thy wisdom.
\[9]Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee to set thee on the throne of Israel. Because Jehovah loved Israel forever, therefore he made thee king, to do justice and righteousness.
\[10]And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices a very great store, and precious stones. There came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
\[11]And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones.
\[12]And the king made pillars of the almug trees for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, also harps and psalteries for the singers. There have come no such almug trees, nor were seen, to this day.
\[13]And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.
\[14]Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty and six talents of gold,
\[15]besides that which the traders brought, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
\[16]And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went to one buckler.
\[17]And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
\[18]Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.
\[19]There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind. And there were supports on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the supports.
\[20]And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.
\[21]And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of silver; it was accounted of nothing in the days of Solomon.
\[22]For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram. Once every three years the navy of Tarshish came, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
\[23]So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
\[24]And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
\[25]And every man brought his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
\[26]And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen. And he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\[27]And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars he made to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.
\[28]And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt. And the king's merchants received them in herds, each herd at a price.
\[29]And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. And so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, they brought them out by their means.

ow king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites,
\[2]of the nations concerning which Jehovah said to the sons of Israel, Ye shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods. Solomon clave to these in love.
\[3]And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines. And his wives turned away his heart.
\[4]For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods. And his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God as was the heart of David his father.
\[5]For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
\[6]And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and went not fully after Jehovah as did David his father.
\[7]Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab on the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the sons of Ammon.
\[8]And so he did for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.
\[9]And Jehovah was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned away from Jehovah, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,
\[10]and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods. But he did not keep that which Jehovah commanded.
\[11]Therefore Jehovah said to Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done by thee, and thou have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.
\[12]Notwithstanding I will not do it in thy days, for David thy father's sake, but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
\[13]However I will not rend away all the kingdom, but I will give one tribe to thy son, for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
\[14]And Jehovah raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite. He was of the king's seed in Edom.
\[15]For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the slain, and had smitten every male in Edom
\[16](for Joab and all Israel remained there six months until he had cut off every male in Edom),
\[17]that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.
\[18]And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran. And they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him provisions, and gave him land.
\[19]And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
\[20]And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house. And Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh.
\[21]And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart that I may go to my own country.
\[22]Then Pharaoh said to him, But what have thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seek to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing, however only let me depart.
\[23]And God raised up another adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.
\[24]And he gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop when David killed them of Zobah. And they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.
\[25]And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad did. And he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
\[26]And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.
\[27]And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.
\[28]And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor. And Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of Joseph.
\[29]And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way. Now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment, and the two were alone in the field.
\[30]And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it in twelve pieces.
\[31]And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces, for thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee
\[32](but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David's sake and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel),
\[33]because that they have forsaken me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the sons of Ammon. And they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and to keep my statutes and my ordinances as David his father did.
\[34]However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant's sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes.
\[35]But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it to thee, even ten tribes.
\[36]And I will give one tribe to his son, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for me to put my name there.
\[37]And I will take thee, and thou shall reign according to all that thy soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.
\[38]And it shall be, if thou will hearken to all that I command thee, and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did. That I will be with thee, and will build thee a sure house as I built for David, and will give Israel to thee.
\[39]And for this I will afflict the seed of David, but not forever.
\[40]Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
\[41]Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
\[42]And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
\[43]And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.

nd Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel came to Shechem to make him king.
\[2]And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt,
\[3]and they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
\[4]Thy father made our yoke grievous. Now therefore make thou lighter the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
\[5]And he said to them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.
\[6]And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye to me to return an answer to this people?
\[7]And they spoke to him, saying, If thou will be a servant to this people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants forever.
\[8]But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that grew up with him, who stood before him.
\[9]And he said to them, What counsel give ye, that we may return an answer to this people who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father put upon us lighter?
\[10]And the young men that grew up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall thou say to this people that spoke to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter to us; thus shall thou speak to them, My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.
\[11]And now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\[12]So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.
\[13]And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,
\[14]and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\[15]So the king did not hearken to the people, for it was a thing brought about by Jehovah, that he might establish his word, which Jehovah spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\[16]And when all Israel saw that the king did not hearken to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel. Now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents.
\[17]But as for the sons of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
\[18]Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram who was over the men subject to task work. And all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
\[19]So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.
\[20]And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel. There was none that followed the house of David, but only the tribe of Judah.
\[21]And when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
\[22]But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
\[23]Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,
\[24]Thus says Jehovah, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers the sons of Israel. Return every man to his house, for this thing is of me. So they hearkened to the word of Jehovah, and returned and went their way according to the word of Jehovah.
\[25]Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and dwelt therein. And he went out from there, and built Penuel.
\[26]And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now the kingdom will return to the house of David.
\[27]If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah. And they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.
\[28]Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold. And he said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
\[29]And he set the one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.
\[30]And this thing became a sin, for the people went to worship before the one, even to Dan.
\[31]And he made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people who were not of the sons of Levi.
\[32]And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar. So he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made. And he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made.
\[33]And he went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart. And he ordained a feast for the sons of Israel, and went up to the altar to burn incense.

nd, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of Jehovah to Bethel. And Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.
\[2]And he cried against the altar by the word of Jehovah, and said, O altar, altar, thus says Jehovah: Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name. And upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones they shall burn upon thee.
\[3]And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which Jehovah has spoken: Behold, the altar shall be torn, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.
\[4]And it came to pass, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to him.
\[5]The altar also was torn, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of Jehovah.
\[6]And the king answered and said to the man of God, Entreat now the favor of Jehovah thy God, and pray for me that my hand may be restored to me again. And the man of God entreated Jehovah, and the king's hand was restored to him again, and became as it was before.
\[7]And the king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.
\[8]And the man of God said to the king, If thou will give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place;
\[9]for so it was charged me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Thou shall eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that thou came.
\[10]So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.
\[11]Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel. And one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. The words which he had spoken to the king, they also told them to their father.
\[12]And their father said to them, What way did he go? Now his sons had seen what way the man of God went, who came from Judah.
\[13]And he said to his sons, Saddle the donkey for me. So they saddled him the donkey, and he rode on it.
\[14]And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak. And he said to him, Are thou the man of God who came from Judah? And he said, I am.
\[15]Then he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
\[16]And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee. Neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place;
\[17]for it was said to me by the word of Jehovah, Thou shall eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou came.
\[18]And he said to him, I also am a prophet as thou are. And an agent spoke to me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Bring him back with thee into thy house that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied to him.
\[19]So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.
\[20]And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of Jehovah came to the prophet who brought him back.
\[21]And he cried out to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, Thus says Jehovah, Forasmuch as thou have been disobedient to the mouth of Jehovah, and have not kept the commandment which Jehovah thy God commanded thee,
\[22]but came back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water, thy body shall not come to the sepulcher of thy fathers.
\[23]And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for him, namely, for the prophet whom he had brought back.
\[24]And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and killed him. And his body was cast in the way, and the donkey stood by it. The lion also stood by the body.
\[25]And, behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body. And they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
\[26]And when the prophet who brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, It is the man of God who was disobedient to the mouth of Jehovah. Therefore Jehovah has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him, and slain him, according to the word of Jehovah which he spoke to him.
\[27]And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle the donkey for me. And they saddled it.
\[28]And he went and found his body cast in the way, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body. The lion had not eaten the body, nor torn the donkey.
\[29]And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it upon the donkey, and brought it back. And he came to the city of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him.
\[30]And he laid his body in his own grave. And they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!
\[31]And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulcher in which the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones.
\[32]For the saying which he cried by the word of Jehovah against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
\[33]After this thing Jeroboam did not return from his evil way, but again made from among all the people priests of the high places. Whoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.
\[34]And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.

t that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
\[2]And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself that thou not be known to be the wife of Jeroboam, and get thee to Shiloh. Behold, there is Ahijah the prophet who spoke concerning me that I should be king over this people.
\[3]And take with thee ten loaves, and cakes, and a cruse of honey, and go to him. He will tell thee what shall become of the child.
\[4]And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were set because of his age.
\[5]And Jehovah said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam comes to inquire of thee concerning her son, for he is sick. Thus and thus thou shall say to her, for it will be, when she comes in, that she will feign herself to be another woman.
\[6]And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam. Why feign thou thyself to be another? For I am sent to thee with heavy news.
\[7]Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,
\[8]and tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee, and yet thou have not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart to do only that which was right in my eyes,
\[9]but have done evil above all who were before thee, and have gone and made thee other gods, and molten images to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind thy back,
\[10]therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man-child, he who is shut up and he who is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam as a man sweeps away dung, till it be all gone.
\[11]He who dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat, and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat, for Jehovah has spoken it.
\[12]Arise thou therefore, get thee to thy house. When thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
\[13]And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him, for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.
\[14]Moreover Jehovah will raise up a king for him over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day. But what? Even now.
\[15]For Jehovah will smite Israel as a reed is shaken in the water. And he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River because they have made their Asherim, provoking Jehovah to anger.
\[16]And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he has sinned, and with which he has made Israel to sin.
\[17]And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah. As she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.
\[18]And all Israel buried him, and mourned for him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet.
\[19]And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
\[20]And the days which Jeroboam reigned were twenty-two years, and he slept with his fathers. And Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
\[21]And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
\[22]And Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done.
\[23]For they also built for them high places, and pillars, and Asherim, on every high hill, and under every green tree.
\[24]And there were also sodomites in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which Jehovah drove out before the sons of Israel.
\[25]And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.
\[26]And he took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house. He even took away all. And he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
\[27]And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard who kept the door of the king's house.
\[28]And it was so, that, as often as the king went into the house of Jehovah, the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.
\[29]Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[30]And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
\[31]And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abijah his son reigned in his stead.

ow in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijah began to reign over Judah.
\[2]He reigned three years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
\[3]And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him. And his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God as the heart of David his father.
\[4]Nevertheless for David's sake Jehovah his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem,
\[5]because David did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and did not turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, except only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
\[6]Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
\[7]And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
\[8]And Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his stead.
\[9]And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah.
\[10]And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. And his grandmother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
\[11]And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah as David his father did.
\[12]And he put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
\[13]And also he removed Maacah his grandmother from being queen because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah. And Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
\[14]But the high places were not taken away. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with Jehovah all his days.
\[15]And he brought into the house of Jehovah the things that his father had dedicated, and the things that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.
\[16]And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
\[17]And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
\[18]Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants. And king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who dwelt at Damascus, saying,
\[19]There is a league between me and thee, between my father and thy father. Behold, I have sent to thee a present of silver and gold. Go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
\[20]And Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
\[21]And it came to pass, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
\[22]Then king Asa made a proclamation to all Judah; none was exempted. And they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber of it, with which Baasha had built. And king Asa built with it Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
\[23]Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
\[24]And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father. And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
\[25]And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah. And he reigned over Israel two years.
\[26]And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.
\[27]And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him. And Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.
\[28]Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
\[29]And it came to pass that, as soon as he was king, he smote all the house of Jeroboam. He left to Jeroboam not any who breathed, until he had destroyed him according to the saying of Jehovah, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite,
\[30]for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and with which he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation with which he provoked Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger.
\[31]Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[32]And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
\[33]In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, and reigned twenty-four years.
\[34]And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.

\[2]Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel, and thou have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins,
\[3]behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house, and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\[4]He of Baasha who dies in the city shall the dogs eat, and he of his who dies in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.
\[5]Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[6]And Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah, and Elah his son reigned in his stead.
\[7]And moreover the word of Jehovah came against Baasha by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani, and against his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he smote him.
\[8]In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and reigned two years.
\[9]And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah.
\[10]And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
\[11]And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he smote all the house of Baasha. He left him not a single man-child, neither of his kinfolks, nor of his friends.
\[12]Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha according to the word of Jehovah, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,
\[13]for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and with which they made Israel to sin, to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
\[14]Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[15]In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
\[16]And the people who were encamped heard say, Zimri has conspired, and has also smitten the king. Therefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.
\[17]And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
\[18]And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire,
\[19]and died for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did to make Israel to sin.
\[20]Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[21]Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts; half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri.
\[22]But the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
\[23]In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel, and reigned twelve years. He reigned six years in Tirzah.
\[24]And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver. And he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria.
\[25]And Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and dealt wickedly above all who were before him.
\[26]For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
\[27]Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[28]So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria, and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
\[29]And in the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel. And Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.
\[30]And Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah above all who were before him.
\[31]And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him.
\[32]And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
\[33]And Ahab made the Asherah. And Ahab did yet more to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.
\[34]In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho. He laid the foundation of it with the loss of Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates of it with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.

\[2]And the word of Jehovah came to him, saying,
\[3]Get thee from here, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith that is before the Jordan.
\[4]And it shall be, that thou shall drink of the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.
\[5]So he went and did according to the word of Jehovah, for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith that is before the Jordan.
\[6]And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening, and he drank of the brook.
\[7]And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up because there was no rain in the land.
\[8]And the word of Jehovah came to him, saying,
\[9]Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee.
\[10]So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks. And he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel that I may drink.
\[11]And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.
\[12]And she said, As Jehovah thy God lives, I do not have a cake, but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the cruse. And, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it, and die.
\[13]And Elijah said to her, Fear not, go and do as thou have said. But make me of it a little cake first, and bring it forth to me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son.
\[14]For thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall not be used up, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that Jehovah sends rain upon the earth.
\[15]And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah. And she, and he, and her house, ate many days.
\[16]The jar of meal was not used up, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spoke by Elijah.
\[17]And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick, and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him.
\[18]And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? Thou have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to kill my son!
\[19]And he said to her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the chamber where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
\[20]And he cried to Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah my God, have thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn by slaying her son?
\[21]And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried to Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.
\[22]And Jehovah hearkened to the voice of Elijah, and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
\[23]And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother. And Elijah said, See, thy son lives.

nd it came to pass after many days, that the word of Jehovah came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself to Ahab, and I will send rain upon the earth.
\[2]And Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. And the famine was severe in Samaria.
\[3]And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared Jehovah greatly;
\[4]for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Jehovah, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifties in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
\[5]And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through the land, to all the fountains of water, and to all the brooks. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not lose all the beasts.
\[6]So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
\[7]And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him. And he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it thou, my lord Elijah?
\[8]And he answered him, It is I. Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
\[9]And he said, How have I sinned that thou would deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab to kill me?
\[10]As Jehovah thy God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek thee. And when they said, He is not here, he took an oath from the kingdom and nation that they did not find thee.
\[11]And now thou say, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
\[12]And it will come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of Jehovah will carry thee where I know not. And so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will kill me. But I thy servant fear Jehovah from my youth.
\[13]Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Jehovah, how I hid a hundred men of Jehovah's prophets by fifties in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
\[14]And now thou say, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here, and he will kill me.
\[15]And Elijah said, As Jehovah of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.
\[16]So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
\[17]And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Is it thou, thou troubler of Israel?
\[18]And he answered, I have not troubled Israel, but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of Jehovah, and thou have followed the Baalim.
\[19]Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred, who eat at Jezebel's table.
\[20]So Ahab sent to all the sons of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to mount Carmel.
\[21]And Elijah came near to all the people, and said, How long do ye go limping between the two sides? If Jehovah be God, follow him, but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
\[22]Then Elijah said to the people, I, even I only, am left a prophet of Jehovah, but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.
\[23]Let them therefore give us two bullocks, and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under. And I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under.
\[24]And call ye on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Jehovah. And the God that answers by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.
\[25]And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first, for ye are many, and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under.
\[26]And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped about the altar which was made.
\[27]And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is meditating, or he is gone aside, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleeps and must be awakened.
\[28]And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them.
\[29]And it was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening oblation, but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
\[30]And Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of Jehovah that was thrown down.
\[31]And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob to whom the word of Jehovah came, saying, Israel shall be thy name.
\[32]And with the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah. And he made a trench around the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
\[33]And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood. And he said, Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood.
\[34]And he said, Do it the second time, and they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time, and they did it the third time.
\[35]And the water ran round about the altar, and he also filled the trench with water.
\[36]And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening oblation, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou are God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.
\[37]Hear me, O Jehovah, hear me, that this people may know that thou, Jehovah, are God, and that thou have turned their heart back again.
\[38]Then the fire of Jehovah fell, and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
\[39]And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces. And they said, Jehovah, he is God, Jehovah, he is God.
\[40]and Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them, and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there.
\[41]And Elijah said to Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of abundance of rain.
\[42]So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel, and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees.
\[43]And he said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.
\[44]And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, a cloud rises out of the sea, as small as a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Make ready thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain not stop thee.
\[45]And it came to pass in a little while, that the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.
\[46]And the hand of Jehovah was on Elijah, and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

nd Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and also how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
\[2]Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.
\[3]And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life. And he came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.
\[4]But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree. And he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is enough, now, O Jehovah, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers.
\[5]And he lay down and slept under a juniper tree, and, behold, an agent touched him, and said to him, Arise and eat.
\[6]And he looked, and, behold, there was at his head a cake baked on the coals, and a cruse of water. And he ate and drank, and laid him down again.
\[7]And the agent of Jehovah came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee.
\[8]And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.
\[9]And he came to a cave there, and lodged there. And, behold, the word of Jehovah came to him, and he said to him, What are thou doing here, Elijah?
\[10]And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts. For the sons of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword. And I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away.
\[11]And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before Jehovah. And, behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before Jehovah, but Jehovah was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but Jehovah was not in the earthquake.
\[12]And after the earthquake a fire, but Jehovah was not in the fire. And after the fire a still small voice.
\[13]And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice to him, and said, What are thou doing here, Elijah?
\[14]And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts. For the sons of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword. And I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life to take it away.
\[15]And Jehovah said to him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus. And when thou come, thou shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria.
\[16]And thou shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi to be king over Israel. And thou shall anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah to be prophet in thy place.
\[17]And it shall come to pass, that he who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall kill. And he who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall kill.
\[18]Yet I have reserved for me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.
\[19]So he departed from there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth. And Elijah passed over to him, and cast his mantle upon him.
\[20]And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said to him, Go back again, for what have I done to thee?
\[21]And he returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.

nd Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together. And there were thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots. And he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.
\[2]And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said to him, Thus says Ben-hadad,
\[3]Thy silver and thy gold is mine, thy wives also and thy sons, even the best, are mine.
\[4]And the king of Israel answered and said, It is according to thy saying, my lord, O king, I am thine, and all that I have.
\[5]And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaks Ben-hadad, saying, I indeed sent to thee, saying, Thou shall deliver to me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy sons.
\[6]But I will send my servants to thee tomorrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants. And it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.
\[7]Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeks mischief, for he sent to me for my wives, and for my sons, and for my silver, and for my gold, and I did not deny him.
\[8]And all the elders and all the people said to him, Do thou not hearken, nor consent.
\[9]Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou sent for to thy servant at the first I will do, but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.
\[10]And Ben-hadad sent to him, and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.
\[11]And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him who girds on his armor boast himself as he who puts it off.
\[12]And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the pavilions, that he said to his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.
\[13]And, behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel, and said, Thus says Jehovah, Have thou seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day, and thou shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[14]And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus says Jehovah, By the young men of the rulers of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? And he answered, Thou.
\[15]Then he mustered the young men of the rulers of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two. And after them he mustered all the people, even all the sons of Israel, being seven thousand.
\[16]And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty-two kings who helped him.
\[17]And the young men of the rulers of the provinces went out first. And Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out from Samaria.
\[18]And he said, Whether they come out for peace, take them alive, or whether they come out for war, take them alive.
\[19]So these went out of the city, the young men of the rulers of the provinces, and the army which followed them.
\[20]And they killed everyone his man. And the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. And Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.
\[21]And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter.
\[22]And the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said to him, Go, strengthen thyself. And mark, and see what thou do, for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.
\[23]And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their god is a god of the hills, therefore they were stronger than we. But let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
\[24]And do this thing: Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their place.
\[25]And number thee an army, like the army that thou have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot. And we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened to their voice, and did so.
\[26]And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.
\[27]And the sons of Israel were mustered, and were supported, and went against them. And the sons of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids, but the Syrians filled the country.
\[28]And a man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, Thus says Jehovah, Because the Syrians have said, Jehovah is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the valleys, therefore I will deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[29]And they encamped one opposite the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined. And the sons of Israel killed of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day.
\[30]But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city, and the wall fell upon twenty-seven thousand men who were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
\[31]And his servants said to him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will save thy life.
\[32]So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad says, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? He is my brother.
\[33]Now the men observed diligently whether anything would come from him. And they quickly caught it, and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him, and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
\[34]And Ben-hadad said to him, The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore, and thou shall make streets for thee in Damascus as my father made in Samaria. And I, said Ahab, will let thee go with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and let him go.
\[35]And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said by the word of Jehovah to his fellow, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.
\[36]Then said he to him, Because thou have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, behold, as soon as thou are departed from me, a lion shall kill thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and killed him.
\[37]Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, smiting and wounding him.
\[38]So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.
\[39]And as the king passed by, he cried out to the king, and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle, and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me, and said, Keep this man. If by any means he is missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shall pay a talent of silver.
\[40]And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, So shall thy judgment be, thyself have decided it.
\[41]And he hastened, and took the headband away from his eyes, and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.
\[42]And he said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Because thou have let go out of thy hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.
\[43]And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.

nd it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, near by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
\[2]And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard that I may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near to my house. And I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it, or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.
\[3]And Naboth said to Ahab, Jehovah forbid it of me that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to thee.
\[4]And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him, for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid himself down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.
\[5]But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is thy spirit so sad that thou eat no bread?
\[6]And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me thy vineyard for money, or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it. And he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.
\[7]And Jezebel his wife said to him, Do thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? Arise, and eat bread, and let thy heart be merry. I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
\[8]So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city, and who dwelt with Naboth.
\[9]And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
\[10]And set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them bear witness against him, saying, Thou cursed God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him to death.
\[11]And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.
\[12]They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
\[13]And the two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him. And the base fellows bore witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth cursed God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him to death with stones.
\[14]Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
\[15]And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money, for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
\[16]And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of it.
\[17]And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
\[18]Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria. Behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth where he has gone down to take possession of it.
\[19]And thou shall speak to him, saying, Thus says Jehovah, Have thou killed and also taken possession? And thou shall speak to him, saying, Thus says Jehovah, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.
\[20]And Ahab said to Elijah, Have thou found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found thee because thou have sold thyself to do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah.
\[21]Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will utterly sweep thee away and will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and he who is shut up and he who is left at large in Israel.
\[22]And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation with which thou have provoked me to anger, and have made Israel to sin.
\[23]And Jehovah spoke also of Jezebel, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.
\[24]He who dies of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat, and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.
\[25](But there was none like Ahab, who sold himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.
\[26]And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did whom Jehovah cast out before the sons of Israel.)
\[27]And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
\[28]And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
\[29]See thou how Ahab humbles himself before me? Because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days, but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.

nd they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
\[2]And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
\[3]And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?
\[4]And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou are, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
\[5]And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah.
\[6]Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.
\[7]But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?
\[8]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah, Micaiah the son of Imlah, but I hate him, for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
\[9]Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.
\[10]Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria. And all the prophets were prophesying before them.
\[11]And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for him horns of iron, and said, Thus says Jehovah, With these thou shall push the Syrians until they be consumed.
\[12]And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper, for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.
\[13]And the messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou good.
\[14]And Micaiah said, As Jehovah lives, what Jehovah says to me, that I will speak.
\[15]And when he came to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go up and prosper, and Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.
\[16]And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?
\[17]And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And Jehovah said, These have no master, let them return every man to his house in peace.
\[18]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
\[19]And Micaiah said, Therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah. I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
\[20]And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.
\[21]And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him.
\[22]And Jehovah said to him, With what? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shall entice him, and shall also prevail. Go forth, and do so.
\[23]Now therefore, behold, Jehovah has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and Jehovah has spoken evil concerning thee.
\[24]Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way did the Spirit of Jehovah go from me to speak to thee?
\[25]And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shall see on that day when thou shall go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
\[26]And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son,
\[27]and say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until I come in peace.
\[28]And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah has not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.
\[29]So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
\[30]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle, but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
\[31]Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.
\[32]And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel, and they turned aside to fight against him. And Jehoshaphat cried out.
\[33]And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
\[34]And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the army, for I am severely wounded.
\[35]And the battle increased that day. And the king was propped up in his chariot against the Syrians. And he died at evening, and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.
\[36]And there went a cry throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his country.
\[37]So the king died, and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria.
\[38]And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood (now the harlots washed themselves there), according to the word of Jehovah which he spoke.
\[39]Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[40]So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
\[41]And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
\[42]Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
\[43]And he walked in all the way of Asa his father. He turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah. However the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
\[44]And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
\[45]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[46]And he put away out of the land the remnant of the sodomites, who remained in the days of his father Asa.
\[47]And there was no king in Edom; a deputy was king.
\[48]Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go, for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.
\[49]Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
\[50]And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
\[51]Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.
\[52]And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, how he made Israel to sin.
\[53]And he served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.

nd Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
\[2]And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick. And he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover of this sickness.
\[3]But the agent of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, Is it because there is no God in Israel that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?
\[4]Now therefore thus says Jehovah, Thou shall not come down from the bed where thou have gone up, but shall surely die. And Elijah departed.
\[5]And the messengers returned to him, and he said to them, Why is it that ye are returned?
\[6]And they said to him, There came up a man to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn again to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus says Jehovah, Is it because there is no God in Israel that thou send to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore thou shall not come down from the bed where thou have gone up, but shall surely die.
\[7]And he said to them, What manner of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?
\[8]And they answered him, He was a hairy man, and girt with a belt of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
\[9]Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him, and, behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. And he spoke to him, O man of God, the king has said, Come down.
\[10]And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
\[11]And again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty. And he answered and said to him, O man of God, thus has the king said, Come down quickly.
\[12]And Elijah answered and said to them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
\[13]And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said to him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.
\[14]Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties, but now let my life be precious in thy sight.
\[15]And the agent of Jehovah said to Elijah, Go down with him; do not be afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king.
\[16]And he said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Inasmuch as thou have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? Therefore thou shall not come down from the bed where thou have gone up, but shall surely die.
\[17]So he died according to the word of Jehovah which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, because he had no son.
\[18]Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

nd it came to pass, when Jehovah would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
\[2]And Elijah said to Elisha, Remain here, I pray thee, for Jehovah has sent me as far as Bethel. And Elisha said, As Jehovah lives, and as thy soul lives, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.
\[3]And the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Do thou know that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head today? And he said, Yes, I know it; hold ye your peace.
\[4]And Elijah said to him, Elisha, remain here, I pray thee, for Jehovah has sent me to Jericho. And he said, As Jehovah lives, and as thy soul lives, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.
\[5]And the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, Do thou know that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head today? And he answered, Yes, I know it; hold ye your peace.
\[6]And Elijah said to him, Remain here, I pray thee, for Jehovah has sent me to the Jordan. And he said, As Jehovah lives, and as thy soul lives, I will not leave thee. And the two went on.
\[7]And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood opposite them afar off. And the two stood by the Jordan.
\[8]And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that the two went over on dry ground.
\[9]And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee before I am taken from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
\[10]And he said, Thou have asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee, but if not, it shall not be so.
\[11]And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which divided them both apart. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
\[12]And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen of it! And he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces.
\[13]He also took up the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.
\[14]And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah? And when he also had smitten the waters, they were divided here and there, and Elisha went over.
\[15]And when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho opposite him saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
\[16]And they said to him, Behold now, there are fifty strong men with thy servants. Let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master, lest the Spirit of Jehovah has taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.
\[17]And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. Therefore they sent fifty men. And they sought three days, but did not find him.
\[18]And they came back to him while he remained at Jericho. And he said to them, Did I not say to you, Do not go?
\[19]And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees, but the water is bad, and the ground barren.
\[20]And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.
\[21]And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said, Thus says Jehovah, I have healed these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or barren land.
\[22]So the waters were healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.
\[23]And he went up from there to Bethel. And as he was going up by the way, there came forth young lads out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, thou baldhead; go up, thou baldhead.
\[24]And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tore forty-two lads of them.
\[25]And he went from there to mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.

ow Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
\[2]And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, but not like his father and like his mother, for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.
\[3]Nevertheless he clung to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; he did not depart therefrom.
\[4]Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master. And he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of a hundred thousand lambs, and of a hundred thousand rams.
\[5]But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
\[6]And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.
\[7]And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up. I am as thou are, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
\[8]And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom.
\[9]So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom. And they made a circuit of seven days' journey, and there was no water for the army, nor for the beasts that followed them.
\[10]And the king of Israel said, Alas! For Jehovah has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
\[11]But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah, that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.
\[12]And Jehoshaphat said, The word of Jehovah is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
\[13]And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? Get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him, No, for Jehovah has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
\[14]And Elisha said, As Jehovah of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.
\[15]But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah came upon him.
\[16]And he said, Thus says Jehovah, Make this valley full of trenches.
\[17]For thus says Jehovah, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain, yet that valley shall be filled with water, and ye shall drink, both ye and your cattle and your beasts.
\[18]And this is but a light thing in the sight of Jehovah. He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.
\[19]And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.
\[20]And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of offering the oblation, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
\[21]Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings came up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.
\[22]And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood.
\[23]And they said, This is blood. The kings are surely destroyed, and they have smitten each man his fellow. Now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.
\[24]And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them, and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites.
\[25]And they beat down the cities. And on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it. And they stopped all the fountains of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir-hareseth only they left the stones of it. However the slingers went about it, and smote it.
\[26]And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too hard for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not.
\[27]Then he took his eldest son who should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel, and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.

ow a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead, and thou know that thy servant feared Jehovah, and the creditor has come to take my two children to him to be bondmen.
\[2]And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for thee? Tell me, what have thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid has not anything in the house except a pot of oil.
\[3]Then he said, Go, borrow for thee vessels abroad from all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.
\[4]And thou shall go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels, and thou shall set aside that which is full.
\[5]So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons. They brought the vessels to her, and she poured out.
\[6]And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to her, There is no more a vessel. And the oil halted.
\[7]Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy sons from the rest.
\[8]And it fell on a day that Elisha passed to Shunem where there was a prominent woman. And she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as often as he passed by he turned in there to eat bread.
\[9]And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God who passes by us continually.
\[10]Let us make, I pray thee, a little chamber on the wall. And let us set a bed for him there, and a table, and a seat, and a lampstand. And it shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in there.
\[11]And it fell on a day that he came there, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.
\[12]And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.
\[13]And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, thou have been caring for us with all this care. What is to be done for thee? Would thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the army? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.
\[14]And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Truly she has no son, and her husband is old.
\[15]And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.
\[16]And he said, At this season, when the time comes round, thou shall embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie to thy handmaid.
\[17]And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said to her.
\[18]And when the child was grown, it fell on a day that he went out to his father to the reapers.
\[19]And he said to his father, My head, my head. And he said to his servant, Carry him to his mother.
\[20]And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.
\[21]And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.
\[22]And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.
\[23]And he said, Why will thou go to him today? It is neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.
\[24]Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward. Do not restrain my riding unless I bid thee.
\[25]So she went, and came to the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is the Shunammite.
\[26]Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with thee? Is it well with thy husband? Is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.
\[27]And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away, but the man of God said, Let her alone, for her soul is vexed within her, and Jehovah has hid it from me, and has not told me.
\[28]Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? Did I not say, do not deceive me?
\[29]Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way. If thou meet any man, do not salute him, and if any salute thee, do not answer him again. And lay my staff upon the face of the child.
\[30]And the mother of the child said, As Jehovah lives, and as thy soul lives, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.
\[31]And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child, but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child has not awakened.
\[32]And when Elisha came into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.
\[33]He went in therefore, and shut the door upon the two of them, and prayed to Jehovah.
\[34]And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands. And he stretched himself upon him, and the flesh of the child grew warm.
\[35]Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro, and went up, and stretched himself upon him. And the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
\[36]And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she came in to him, he said, Take up thy son.
\[37]Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground. And she took up her son, and went out.
\[38]And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And there was a dearth in the land, and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him. And he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.
\[39]And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered wild gourds from it, his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage, for they did not know them.
\[40]So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat of it.
\[41]But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot, and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.
\[42]And a man came from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And he said, Give to the people that they may eat.
\[43]And his servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? But he said, Give to the people that they may eat, for thus says Jehovah, They shall eat, and shall leave of it.
\[44]So he set it before them, and they ate, and left of it according to the word of Jehovah.

ow Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Jehovah had given victory to Syria. He was also a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.
\[2]And the Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden, and she waited on Naaman's wife.
\[3]And she said to her mistress, Would that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of his leprosy.
\[4]And a man went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maiden who is of the land of Israel.
\[5]And the king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
\[6]And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And now when this letter has come to thee, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to thee that thou may heal him of his leprosy.
\[7]And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he tore his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? But consider, I pray you, and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.
\[8]And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why have thou torn thy clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
\[9]So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
\[10]And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shall be clean.
\[11]But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought he will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Jehovah his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leper.
\[12]Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? May I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.
\[13]And his servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, would thou not have done it? How much rather then, when he says to thee, Wash, and be clean?
\[14]Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God. And his flesh came again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
\[15]And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him. And he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, take a present from thy servant.
\[16]But he said, As Jehovah lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it, but he refused.
\[17]And Naaman said, If not, yet, I pray thee, let there be given to thy servant two mules' burden of dirt, for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Jehovah.
\[18]In this thing Jehovah pardon thy servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, Jehovah pardon thy servant in this thing.
\[19]And he said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.
\[20]But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As Jehovah lives, I will run after him, and take something from him.
\[21]So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?
\[22]And he said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now there come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets. Give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.
\[23]And Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants, and they bore them before him.
\[24]And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house, and he let the men go, and they departed.
\[25]But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, From where did thou come, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went nowhere.
\[26]And he said to him, Did not my heart go with thee when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and maid-servants?
\[27]The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cling to thee, and to thy seed forever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.

nd the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell before thee is too confined for us.
\[2]Let us go, we pray thee, to the Jordan, and every man take a beam from there, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.
\[3]And one said, Be pleased, I pray thee, to go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.
\[4]So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood.
\[5]But as one was felling a beam, the axe-head fell into the water. And he cried, and said, Alas, my master! For it was borrowed.
\[6]And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in there, and made the iron to float.
\[7]And he said, Take it up to thee. So he put out his hand, and took it.
\[8]Now the king of Syria was warring against Israel, and he took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.
\[9]And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou not pass such a place, for the Syrians are coming down there.
\[10]And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of. And he saved himself there, not once nor twice.
\[11]And the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled for this thing, and he called his servants, and said to them, Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?
\[12]And one of his servants said, No, my lord, O king, but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel tells the king of Israel the words that thou speak in thy bedchamber.
\[13]And he said, Go and see where he is that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.
\[14]Therefore he sent there horses, and chariots, and a great army. And they came by night, and encompassed the city about.
\[15]And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an army with horses and chariots was round about the city. And his servant said to him, Alas, my master! What shall we do?
\[16]And he answered, Fear not, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.
\[17]And Elisha prayed, and said, Jehovah, I pray thee, open his eyes that he may see. And Jehovah opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw. And, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
\[18]And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed to Jehovah, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
\[19]And Elisha said to them, This is not the way, neither is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. And he led them to Samaria.
\[20]And it came to pass, when they came into Samaria, that Elisha said, Jehovah, open the eyes of these men that they may see. And Jehovah opened their eyes, and they saw. And, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
\[21]And the king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? Shall I smite them?
\[22]And he answered, Thou shall not smite them. Would thou smite those whom thou have taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? Set bread and water before them that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.
\[23]And he prepared great provision for them. And when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
\[24]And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
\[25]And there was a great famine in Samaria. And, behold, they besieged it until a donkey's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.
\[26]And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.
\[27]And he said, If Jehovah does not help thee, from where shall I help thee? Out of the threshing-floor, or out of the winepress?
\[28]And the king said to her, What troubles thee? And she answered, This woman said to me, Give thy son that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.
\[29]So we boiled my son, and ate him. And I said to her on the next day, Give thy son that we may eat him. And she has hid her son.
\[30]And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes (now he was passing by upon the wall). And the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth inside upon his flesh.
\[31]Then he said, God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.
\[32]But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And the king sent a man from before him, but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, Do ye see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door fast against him. Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?
\[33]And while he was yet talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him, and he said, Behold, this evil is of Jehovah. Why should I wait for Jehovah any longer?

nd Elisha said, Hear ye the word of Jehovah. Thus says Jehovah, Tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
\[2]Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if Jehovah should make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shall see it with thine eyes, but shall not eat of it.
\[3]Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate, and they said one to another, Why do we sit here until we die?
\[4]If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall to the army of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we shall live, and if they kill us, we shall but die.
\[5]And they rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians. And when they came to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there.
\[6]For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great army. And they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.
\[7]Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.
\[8]And when these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drank, and carried from there silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it. And they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried from there also, and went and hid it.
\[9]Then they said one to another, We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we keep silent. If we delay till the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household.
\[10]So they came and called to the porter of the city. And they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were.
\[11]And he called the porters, and they told it to the king's household within.
\[12]And the king arose in the night, and said to his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city we shall take them alive, and get into the city.
\[13]And one of his servants answered and said, Let, I pray thee, some men take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are consumed), and let us send and see.
\[14]Therefore they took two chariots with horses. And the king sent after the army of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.
\[15]And they went after them to the Jordan. And, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.
\[16]And the people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of Jehovah.
\[17]And the king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate. And the people trampled upon him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.
\[18]And it came to pass, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria.
\[19]And that captain answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if Jehovah should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shall see it with thine eyes, but shall not eat of it.
\[20]It came to pass even so to him, for the people trampled upon him in the gate, and he died.

ow Elisha had spoken to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thy household, and sojourn wherever thou can sojourn, for Jehovah has called for a famine, and it shall also come upon the land seven years.
\[2]And the woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God. And she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
\[3]And it came to pass at the end of seven years, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines, and she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land.
\[4]Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha has done.
\[5]And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him who was dead, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.
\[6]And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.
\[7]And Elisha came to Damascus, and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick. And it was told him, saying, The man of God has come here.
\[8]And the king said to Hazael, Take a present in thy hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of Jehovah by him, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?
\[9]So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria has sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?
\[10]And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, Thou shall surely recover. However Jehovah has shown me that he shall surely die.
\[11]And he settled his countenance steadfastly upon him, until he was ashamed. And the man of God wept.
\[12]And Hazael said, Why do thou weep my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou will do to the sons of Israel: their strongholds thou will set on fire, and their young men thou will kill with the sword, and will dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their women with child.
\[13]And Hazael said, But what is thy servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, Jehovah has shown me that thou shall be king over Syria.
\[14]Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, What did Elisha say to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou would surely recover.
\[15]And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took the coverlet, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died. And Hazael reigned in his stead.
\[16]And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.
\[17]He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
\[18]And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.
\[19]However Jehovah would not destroy Judah, for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give to him a lamp for his sons always.
\[20]In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
\[21]Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him. And he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that encompassed him about, and the captains of the chariots. And the people fled to their tents.
\[22]So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
\[23]And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[24]And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
\[25]In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.
\[26]Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
\[27]And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did the house of Ahab, for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.
\[28]And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead, and the Syrians wounded Joram.
\[29]And king Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.

nd Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up thy loins, and take this vial of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.
\[2]And when thou come there, look out there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brothers, and carry him to an inner chamber.
\[3]Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus says Jehovah, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and delay not.
\[4]So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.
\[5]And when he came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting. And he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, To which of us all? And he said, To thee, O captain.
\[6]And he arose, and went into the house. And he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of Jehovah, even over Israel.
\[7]And thou shall smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Jehovah, at the hand of Jezebel.
\[8]For the whole house of Ahab shall perish. And I will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel.
\[9]And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.
\[10]And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.
\[11]Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord, and one said to him, Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to thee? And he said to them, Ye know the man and what his talk was.
\[12]And they said, It is not true; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus he spoke to me, saying, Thus says Jehovah, I have anointed thee king over Israel.
\[13]Then they hastened, and every man took his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, Jehu is king.
\[14]So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.
\[15]But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If this be your mind, then let none escape and go forth out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.
\[16]So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah came down to see Joram.
\[17]Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?
\[18]So one went on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus says the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What have thou to do with peace? Turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he does not come back.
\[19]Then he sent out a second on horseback who came to them, and said, Thus says the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What have thou to do with peace? Turn thee behind me.
\[20]And the watchman told, saying, He came to them, and does not come back. And the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.
\[21]And Joram said, Make ready. And they made his chariot ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
\[22]And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?
\[23]And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.
\[24]And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and smote Joram between his arms. And the arrow went out at his heart, and he sank down in his chariot.
\[25]Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. For remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, Jehovah laid this burden upon him:
\[26]Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, says Jehovah, and I will requite thee in this plot, says Jehovah. Now therefore take and cast him into the plot of ground, according to the word of Jehovah.
\[27]But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden-house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they smote him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.
\[28]And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulcher with his fathers in the city of David.
\[29](And it was in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.)
\[30]And when Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it. And she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and looked out at the window.
\[31]And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Is it peace, thou Zimri, thy master's murderer?
\[32]And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? Who? And two or three eunuchs looked out to him.
\[33]And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down. And some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses. And he trampled her under foot.
\[34]And when he came in, he ate and drank, and he said, Now see to this cursed woman, and bury her, for she is a king's daughter.
\[35]And they went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.
\[36]Therefore they came back, and told him. And he said, This is the word of Jehovah, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel,
\[37]and the body of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.

ow Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and to those who brought up the sons of Ahab, saying,
\[2]And now as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, also a fortified city, and armor,
\[3]look ye out for the best and fittest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.
\[4]But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, the two kings did not stand before him. How then shall we stand?
\[5]And he who was over the household, and he who was over the city, the elders also, and those who brought up the sons, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shall bid us. We will not make any man king. Do thou that which is good in thine eyes.
\[6]Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be on my side, and if ye will hearken to my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city who reared them.
\[7]And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and killed them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel.
\[8]And a messenger came, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.
\[9]And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye are righteous. Behold, I conspired against my master, and killed him. But who smote all these?
\[10]Know now that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of Jehovah, which Jehovah spoke concerning the house of Ahab, for Jehovah has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah.
\[11]So Jehu smote all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left to him none remaining.
\[12]And he arose and departed, and went to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing-house of the shepherds in the way,
\[13]Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brothers of Ahaziah, and we go down to salute the sons of the king and the sons of the queen.
\[14]And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and killed them at the pit of the shearing-house, even forty-two men; neither did he leave any of them.
\[15]And when he was departed from there, he came upon on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him. And he saluted him, and said to him, Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thy hand. And he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot.
\[16]And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Jehovah. So they made him ride in his chariot.
\[17]And when he came to Samaria, he smote all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spoke to Elijah.
\[18]And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him much.
\[19]Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshippers, and all his priests. Let none be lacking, for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal. Whoever shall be lacking, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
\[20]And Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.
\[21]And Jehu sent through all Israel. And all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. And they came into the house of Baal, and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another.
\[22]And he said to him who was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought forth for them vestments.
\[23]And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal. And he said to the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of Jehovah, but the worshippers of Baal only.
\[24]And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed for him eighty men outside, and said, If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, he who lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him.
\[25]And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and kill them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword. And the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.
\[26]And they brought forth the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them.
\[27]And they broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it an out-house to this day.
\[28]Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
\[29]However from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin, Jehu did not depart from after them, namely, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.
\[30]And Jehovah said to Jehu, Because thou have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, thy sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.
\[31]But Jehu did not take heed to walk in the law of Jehovah, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin.
\[32]In those days Jehovah began to cut off from Israel. And Hazael smote them in all the borders of Israel,
\[33]from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
\[34]Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[35]And Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.
\[36]And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.

ow when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal seed.
\[2]But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's sons who were slain, even him and his nurse, and put them in the bedchamber. And they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.
\[3]And he was with her hidden in the house of Jehovah six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land.
\[4]And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into the house of Jehovah. And he made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of Jehovah, and showed them the king's son.
\[5]And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, who come in on the sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the king's house;
\[6]and a third part shall be at the gate Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard. So shall ye keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier.
\[7]And the two companies of you, even all who go forth on the sabbath, shall keep the watch of the house of Jehovah around the king.
\[8]And ye shall encompass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand. And he who comes within the ranks, let him be slain. And be ye with the king when he goes out, and when he comes in.
\[9]And the captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And every man took his men, those who were to come in on the sabbath, with those who were to go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.
\[10]And the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David's, which were in the house of Jehovah.
\[11]And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.
\[12]Then he brought out the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony. And they made him king, and anointed him. And they clapped their hands, and said, Live, O king.
\[13]And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah.
\[14]And she looked, and, behold, the king stood by the pillar, as the manner was, and the captains and the trumpets by the king. And all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and cried, Treason! treason!
\[15]And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, Have her forth between the ranks, and kill with the sword the man who follows her. For the priest said, Let her not be slain in the house of Jehovah.
\[16]So they made way for her. And she went by the way of the horses' entry to the king's house, and there was she slain.
\[17]And Jehoiada made a covenant between Jehovah and the king and the people, that they should be Jehovah's people; between the king also and the people.
\[18]And all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and broke it down. They broke in pieces his altars and his images thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of Jehovah.
\[19]And he took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land, and they brought down the king from the house of Jehovah, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.

\[2]And Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
\[3]However the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
\[4]And Joash said to the priests, All the money of the hallowed things that is brought into the house of Jehovah, in current money, the money of the persons for whom each man is rated, and all the money that it comes into any man's heart to bring into the house of Jehovah,
\[5]let the priests take it to them, every man from his acquaintance, and they shall repair the broken parts of the house wherever any breach shall be found.
\[6]But it was so, that in the twenty-third year of king Joash the priests had not repaired the broken parts of the house.
\[7]Then king Joash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said to them, Why do ye not repair the broken parts of the house? Now therefore take no more money from your acquaintance, but deliver it for the broken parts of the house.
\[8]And the priests consented that they should take no more money from the people, neither repair the broken parts of the house.
\[9]But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as a man comes into the house of Jehovah. And the priests who kept the threshold put in it all the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah.
\[10]And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Jehovah.
\[11]And they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the house of Jehovah. And they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders who worked upon the house of Jehovah,
\[12]and to the masons and the hewers of stone, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the broken parts of the house of Jehovah, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.
\[13]But there were not made for the house of Jehovah cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah,
\[14]for they gave that to those who did the work, and with it repaired the house of Jehovah.
\[15]Moreover they did not reckon with the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work, for they dealt faithfully.
\[16]The money for the trespass offerings, and the money for the sin offerings, was not brought into the house of Jehovah; it was the priests'.
\[17]Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it. And Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.
\[18]And Joash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and of the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria. And he went away from Jerusalem.
\[19]Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[20]And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and smote Joash at the house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla.
\[21]For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died. And they buried him with his fathers in the city of David. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

\[2]And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. He did not depart from it.
\[3]And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, continually.
\[4]And Jehoahaz besought Jehovah, and Jehovah hearkened to him, for he saw the oppression of Israel, how that the king of Syria oppressed them.
\[5](And Jehovah gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians, and the sons of Israel dwelt in their tents as beforetime.
\[6]Nevertheless they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin, but walked therein. And the Asherah also remained in Samaria.)
\[7]For he did not leave to Jehoahaz of the people except fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen, for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing.
\[8]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[9]And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Joash his son reigned in his stead.
\[10]In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years.

\[13]And Joash slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat upon his throne. And Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
\[14]Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness of which he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over him, and said, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen of it!
\[15]And Elisha said to him, Take bow and arrows. And he took to him bow and arrows.
\[16]And he said to the king of Israel, Put thy hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it. And Elisha laid his hands upon the king's hands.
\[17]And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, Jehovah's arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria, for thou shall smite the Syrians in Aphek till thou have consumed them.
\[18]And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stopped.
\[19]And the man of God was angry with him, and said, Thou should have smitten five or six times. Then thou would have smitten Syria till thou had consumed it, whereas now thou shall smite Syria but thrice.
\[20]And Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
\[21]And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band, and they cast the man into the sepulcher of Elisha. And as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.
\[22]And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
\[23]But Jehovah was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither did he cast them from his presence as yet.
\[24]And Hazael king of Syria died, and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.
\[25]And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz again took out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times Joash smote him, and recovered the cities of Israel.

\[2]He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.
\[3]And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, yet not like David his father. He did according to all that Joash his father had done.
\[4]However the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
\[5]And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father,
\[6]but he did not put to death the sons of the murderers, according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the sons, nor the sons be put to death for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.
\[7]He killed ten thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt, and took Sela by war, and called the name of it Joktheel, to this day.
\[8]Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look each other in the face.
\[9]And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife. And a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by, and trampled the thistle.
\[10]Thou have indeed smitten Edom, and thy heart has lifted thee up. Glory by it, and abide at home, for why should thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou should fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
\[11]But Amaziah would not hear. So Jehoash king of Israel went up. And he and Amaziah king of Judah looked each other in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
\[12]And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.
\[13]And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
\[14]And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
\[15]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[16]And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. And Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.

\[18]Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[19]And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. And he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish, and killed him there.
\[20]And they brought him upon horses, and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
\[21]And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah.
\[22]He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
\[23]In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty-one years.
\[24]And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah. He did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin.
\[25]He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the sea of the Arabah, according to the word of Jehovah, the God of Israel, which he spoke by his servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath-hepher.
\[26]For Jehovah saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter, for there was none shut up nor left at large, neither was there any helper for Israel.
\[27]And Jehovah did not say that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
\[28]Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[29]And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel, and Zechariah his son reigned in his stead.

n the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
\[2]Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not do that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah his God, like David his father.
\[3]But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel. Yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out from before the sons of Israel.
\[4]And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
\[5]Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war, and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.
\[6]At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath. And the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there to this day.
\[7]So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son. Come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.
\[8]And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.
\[9]And the king of Assyria hearkened to him. And the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and killed Rezin.
\[10]And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus. And king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the form of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship of it.
\[11]And Urijah the priest built an altar. According to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so Urijah the priest made it until the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus.
\[12]And when the king came from Damascus, the king saw the altar. And the king drew near to the altar, and offered thereon.
\[13]And he burnt his burnt offering and his meal offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar.
\[14]And the brazen altar, which was before Jehovah, he brought from the forefront of the house, from between his altar and the house of Jehovah, and put it on the north side of his altar.
\[15]And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meal offering, and the king's burnt offering, and his meal offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meal offering, and their drink offerings. And sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice. But the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire by.
\[16]Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.
\[17]And king Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the laver from off them, and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stone.
\[18]And the covered place for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry outside, he turned from the house of Jehovah, because of the king of Assyria.

n the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign in Samaria over Israel, and reigned nine years.
\[2]And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, yet not as the kings of Israel who were before him.
\[3]Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him. And Hoshea became his servant, and brought him tribute.
\[4]And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea, for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
\[5]Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.
\[6]In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
\[7]And it was so, because the sons of Israel had sinned against Jehovah their God who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
\[8]and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom Jehovah cast out from before the sons of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they made.
\[9]And the sons of Israel did things secretly that were not right against Jehovah their God. And they built for them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.
\[10]And they set up for them pillars and Asherim upon every high hill, and under every green tree,
\[11]and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as the nations did whom Jehovah carried away before them. And they wrought wicked things to provoke Jehovah to anger.
\[12]And they served idols, of which Jehovah had said to them, Ye shall not do this thing.
\[13]Yet Jehovah testified to Israel, and to Judah, by every prophet, and every seer, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.
\[14]Notwithstanding, they would not hear, but stiffened their neck, like the neck of their fathers who did not believe in Jehovah their God.
\[15]And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified to them. And they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the nations that were round about them, concerning whom Jehovah had charged them that they should not do like them.
\[16]And they forsook all the commandments of Jehovah their God, and made for them molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
\[17]And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah to provoke him to anger.
\[18]Therefore Jehovah was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight. There was none left but only the tribe of Judah.
\[19]Also Judah did not keep the commandments of Jehovah their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.
\[20]And Jehovah rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.
\[21]For he tore Israel from the house of David. And they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. And Jeroboam drove Israel from following Jehovah, and made them sin a great sin.
\[22]And the sons of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did. They did not depart from them
\[23]until Jehovah removed Israel out of his sight, as he spoke by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.
\[24]And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the sons of Israel. And they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities of it.
\[25]And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they were not afraid of Jehovah. Therefore Jehovah sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
\[26]Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou have carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria know not the law of the god of the land. Therefore he has sent lions among them, and, behold, they kill them, because they do not know the law of the god of the land.
\[27]Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry there one of the priests whom ye brought from there, and let them go and dwell there. And let him teach them the law of the god of the land.
\[28]So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Jehovah.
\[29]However every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.
\[30]And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
\[31]and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak. And the Sepharvites burnt their sons in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
\[32]So they were afraid of Jehovah, and made for them priests of the high places from among themselves, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.
\[33]They were afraid of Jehovah, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.
\[34]To this day they do after the former manner. They do not fear Jehovah, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law or after the commandment which Jehovah commanded the sons of Jacob, whom he named Israel,
\[35]with whom Jehovah had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them.
\[36]But Jehovah, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, him ye shall fear, and to him ye shall bow yourselves, and to him ye shall sacrifice.
\[37]And the statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore. And ye shall not fear other gods.
\[38]And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget. Neither shall ye fear other gods,
\[39]but ye shall ye fear Jehovah your God, and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
\[40]However they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.
\[41]So these nations were afraid of Jehovah, and served their graven images, their sons likewise, and their son's sons, as did their fathers, so do they to this day.

ow it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
\[2]He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah.
\[3]And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done.
\[4]He removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah, and he broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made. For to those days the sons of Israel burned incense to it, and he called it Nehushtan.
\[5]He trusted in Jehovah, the God of Israel, so that there was none like him among all the kings of Judah after him, nor among those who were before him.
\[6]For he clung to Jehovah. He did not depart from following him, but kept his commandments, which Jehovah commanded Moses.
\[7]And Jehovah was with him. Wherever he went forth he prospered. And he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and did not serve him.
\[8]He smote the Philistines to Gaza and the borders of it, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.
\[9]And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
\[10]And at the end of three years they took it. Samaria was taken in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel.
\[11]And the king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,
\[12]because they did not obey the voice of Jehovah their God, but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it.
\[13]Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
\[14]And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended. Return from me. That which thou put on me I will bear. And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
\[15]And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king's house.
\[16]At that time Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of Jehovah, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
\[17]And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they came up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway of the fuller's field.
\[18]And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
\[19]And Rabshakeh said to them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this in which thou trust?
\[20]Thou say (but they are but vain words), There is counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom do thou trust that thou have rebelled against me?
\[21]Now, behold, thou trust upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man leans it will go into his hand, and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him.
\[22]But if ye say to me, We trust in Jehovah our God, is that not he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
\[23]Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
\[24]How then can thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
\[25]Have I now come up without Jehovah against this place to destroy it? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
\[26]Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, said to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it. And do not speak with us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people who are on the wall.
\[27]But Rabshakeh said to them, Has my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? Has he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own urine with you?
\[28]Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spoke, saying, Hear ye the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.
\[29]Thus says the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand.
\[30]Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[31]Do not hearken to Hezekiah. For thus says the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me. And eat ye every man of his vine, and every man of his fig tree, and drink ye every man the waters of his own cistern,
\[32]until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and of honey, that ye may live, and not die. And do not hearken to Hezekiah when he persuades you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us.
\[33]Have any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\[34]Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
\[35]Who are they among all the gods of the countries that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
\[36]But the people were silent, and did not answer him a word, for the king's commandment was, saying, Do not answer him.
\[37]Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

nd it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.
\[2]And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests (covered with sackcloth) to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
\[3]And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy, for the sons have come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring forth.
\[4]It may be that Jehovah thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God has heard. Therefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.
\[5]So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
\[6]And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus says Jehovah, Do not be afraid of the words that thou have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
\[7]Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear news, and shall return to his own land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
\[8]So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
\[9]And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he comes out to fight against thee, he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,
\[10]Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Do not let thy God in whom thou trust deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[11]Behold, thou have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. And shall thou be delivered?
\[12]Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden that were in Telassar?
\[13]Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?
\[14]And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it. And Hezekiah went up to the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.
\[15]And Hezekiah prayed before Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sits above the cherubim, thou are the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. Thou have made heaven and earth.
\[16]Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear. Open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see. And hear the words of Sennacherib, with which he has sent for him to defy the living God.
\[17]Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,
\[18]and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they have destroyed them.
\[19]Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save thou us, I beseech thee, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou Jehovah are God alone.
\[20]Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Whereas thou have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard.
\[21]This is the word that Jehovah has spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised thee and laughed thee to scorn. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at thee.
\[22]Whom have thou defied and blasphemed? And against whom have thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? Even against the Holy One of Israel.
\[23]By thy messengers thou have defied the Lord, and have said, With the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon. And I will cut down the tall cedars of it, and the choice fir trees of it. And I will enter into his farthest lodging-place, the forest of his fruitful field.
\[24]I have dug and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt.
\[25]Have thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that thou should be to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
\[26]Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded. They were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as grain blasted before it is grown up.
\[27]But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.
\[28]Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou came.
\[29]And this shall be the sign to thee: Ye shall eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs of the same. And in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of it.
\[30]And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
\[31]For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion those who shall escape. The zeal of Jehovah shall perform this.
\[32]Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.
\[33]By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come to this city, says Jehovah.
\[34]For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\[35]And it came to pass that night, that the agent of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred eighty-five thousand. And when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
\[36]So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
\[37]And it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer smote him with the sword, and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.

n those days Hezekiah was sick to death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Set thy house in order, for thou shall die, and not live.
\[2]Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Jehovah, saying,
\[3]Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept greatly.
\[4]And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle part of the city, that the word of Jehovah came to him, saying,
\[5]Turn back, and say to Hezekiah the prince of my people, Thus says Jehovah, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears. Behold, I will heal thee. On the third day thou shall go up to the house of Jehovah.
\[6]And I will add to thy days fifteen years. And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria. And I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\[7]And Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.
\[8]And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What shall be the sign that Jehovah will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah the third day?
\[9]And Isaiah said, This shall be the sign to thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do the thing that he has spoken: Shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?
\[10]And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps. No, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.
\[11]And Isaiah the prophet cried to Jehovah, and he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz.
\[12]At that time Berodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
\[13]And Hezekiah hearkened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not show them.
\[14]Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What did these men say, and from where did they come to thee? And Hezekiah said, They have come from a far country, even from Babylon.
\[15]And he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.
\[16]And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah.
\[17]Behold, the days come that all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store to this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, says Jehovah.
\[18]And of thy sons who shall issue from thee, whom thou shall beget, they shall take away. And they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
\[19]Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, The word of Jehovah which thou have spoken is good. He said moreover, Is it not so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?
\[20]Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[21]And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

anasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hephzibah.
\[2]And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the sons of Israel.
\[3]For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed. And he reared up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them.
\[4]And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, of which Jehovah said, In Jerusalem I will put my name.
\[5]And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.
\[6]And he made his son to pass through the fire, and practiced augury, and used enchantments, and dealt with psychics, and with sorcery. He wrought much evil in the sight of Jehovah to provoke him to anger.
\[7]And he set the graven image of Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which Jehovah said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever.
\[8]Neither will I cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.
\[9]But they did not hearken. And Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than did the nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the sons of Israel.
\[10]And Jehovah spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,
\[11]Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did who were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols,
\[12]therefore thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I bring such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.
\[13]And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab. And I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
\[14]And I will cast off the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies. And they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies,
\[15]because they have done that which is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt even to this day.
\[16]Moreover Manasseh shed very much innocent blood till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, besides his sin with which he made Judah to sin in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.
\[17]Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[18]And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza, and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
\[19]Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
\[20]And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah as did Manasseh his father.
\[21]And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshiped them.
\[22]And he forsook Jehovah, the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of Jehovah.
\[23]And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house.
\[24]But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon. And the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
\[25]Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

\[2]And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in all the way of David his father, and did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
\[3]And it came to pass, in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Jehovah, saying,
\[4]Go up to Hilkiah the high priest that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Jehovah, which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people.
\[5]And let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Jehovah. And let them give it to the workmen who are in the house of Jehovah, to repair the broken parts of the house,
\[6]to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house.
\[7]However there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, for they dealt faithfully.
\[8]And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
\[9]And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Jehovah.
\[10]And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered to me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
\[11]And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he tore his clothes.
\[12]And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying,
\[13]Go ye, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found, for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this book to do according to all that which is written concerning us.
\[14]So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter), and they conversed with her.
\[15]And she said to them, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man who sent you to me,
\[16]Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of it, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read.
\[17]Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.
\[18]But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel: As concerning the words which thou have heard,
\[19]because thy heart was tender, and thou humbled thyself before Jehovah when thou heard what I spoke against this place, and against the inhabitants of it, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have torn thy clothes, and wept before me, I also have heard thee, says Jehovah.
\[20]Therefore, behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shall be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.

\[2]And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great. And he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of Jehovah.
\[3]And the king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before Jehovah to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and all his soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.
\[4]And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring forth out of the temple of Jehovah all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the host of heaven, and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Bethel.
\[5]And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; those also who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
\[6]And he brought out the Asherah from the house of Jehovah, outside Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast the dust of it upon the graves of the common people.
\[7]And he broke down the houses of the sodomites that were in the house of Jehovah where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.
\[8]And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba. And he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.
\[9]Nevertheless the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of Jehovah in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers.
\[10]And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the sons of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.
\[11]And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of Jehovah, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs. And he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
\[12]And the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of Jehovah, the king broke down, and beat them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.
\[13]And the king defiled the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the sons of Ammon.
\[14]And he broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of men.
\[15]Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down. And he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah.
\[16]And as Josiah turned himself, he noticed the sepulchers that were there in the mount. And he sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchers, and burned them upon the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of Jehovah which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.
\[17]Then he said, What monument is that which I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulcher of the man of God who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou have done against the altar of Bethel.
\[18]And he said, Let him be; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria.
\[19]And Josiah also took away all the houses of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke Jehovah to anger. And he did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.
\[20]And he killed all the priests of the high places that were there, upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them. And he returned to Jerusalem.
\[21]And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the Passover to Jehovah your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.
\[22]Surely such a Passover was not kept from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah.
\[23]But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah this Passover was kept to Jehovah in Jerusalem.
\[24]Moreover Josiah put away the psychics, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of Jehovah.
\[25]And there was no king before him like him, who turned to Jehovah with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither arose any like him after him.
\[26]Notwithstanding, Jehovah did not turn from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked him.
\[27]And Jehovah said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.
\[28]Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[29]In his days Pharaoh-necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates, and king Josiah went against him. And Pharaoh-necoh killed him at Megiddo when he had seen him.
\[30]And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulcher. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.
\[31]Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\[32]And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.
\[33]And Pharaoh-necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem. And he put the land to a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
\[34]And Pharaoh-necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz away, and he came to Egypt, and died there.
\[35]And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh, but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh. He exacted the silver and the gold from the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it to Pharaoh-necoh.
\[36]Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.

\[2]And Jehovah sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the sons of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spoke by his servants the prophets.
\[3]Surely at the commandment of Jehovah this came upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did,
\[4]and also for the innocent blood that he shed, for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and Jehovah would not pardon.
\[5]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[6]So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
\[7]And the king of Egypt did not come again any more out of his land, for the king of Babylon had taken, from the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king of Egypt.
\[8]Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
\[9]And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his father had done.
\[10]At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
\[11]And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city while his servants were besieging it.
\[12]And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers. And the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
\[13]And he carried out from there all the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of Jehovah, as Jehovah had said.
\[14]And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the rulers, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the blacksmiths. None remained except the poorest sort of the people of the land.
\[15]And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon. And the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the chief men of the land, he carried into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
\[16]And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the blacksmiths a thousand, all of them strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
\[17]And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's father's brother, king is his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
\[18]Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\[19]And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
\[20]For it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah through the anger of Jehovah, until he had cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

\[2]So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
\[3]On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
\[4]Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about), and the king went by the way of the Arabah.
\[5]But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. And all his army was scattered from him.
\[6]Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah. And they gave judgment upon him.
\[7]And they killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
\[8]Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
\[9]And he burnt the house of Jehovah, and the king's house. And all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, he burnt with fire.
\[10]And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.
\[11]And the remnant of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the remnant of the multitude, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive.
\[12]But the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.
\[13]And the pillars of brass that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of Jehovah, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.
\[14]And they took away the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered.
\[15]And the captain of the guard took away the firepans, and the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver.
\[16]The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah, the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
\[17]The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass was upon it. And the height of the capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass. And the second pillar had like these with network.
\[18]And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold.
\[19]And he took an officer out of the city who was set over the men of war; and five men of those who saw the king's face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city.
\[20]And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
\[21]And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.
\[22]And as for the people who were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor over them.
\[23]Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
\[24]And Gedaliah swore to them and to their men, and said to them, Fear not because of the servants of the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
\[25]But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal seed, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, so that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.
\[26]And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt, for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
\[27]And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison.
\[28]And he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,
\[29]and changed his prison garments. And Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life,
\[30]and for his allowance. There was a continual allowance given him from the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.

\[19]And they made war with the Hagrites, with Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab.
\[20]And they were helped against them, and the Hagrites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them, for they cried to God in the battle, and he was entreated by them because they put their trust in him.
\[21]And they took away their cattle: of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of donkeys two thousand, and of men a hundred thousand.
\[22]For there fell many slain, because the war was of God. And they dwelt in their stead until the captivity.
\[23]And the sons of the half-tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land. They increased from Bashan to Baal-hermon and Senir and mount Hermon.
\[24]And these were the heads of their fathers' houses: even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valor, famous men, heads of their fathers' houses.
\[25]And they trespassed against the God of their fathers, and played the harlot after the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God destroyed before them.
\[26]And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river of Gozan to this day.

\[2]And the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons. And the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
\[3]And the battle went hard against Saul, and the archers overtook him. And he was wounded because of the archers.
\[4]Then Saul said to his armor bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armor bearer would not, for he was very afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.
\[5]And when his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died.
\[6]So Saul died, and his three sons. And all his house died together.
\[7]And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities, and fled. And the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
\[8]And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
\[9]And they stripped him, and took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about to carry the news to their idols, and to the people.
\[10]And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.
\[11]And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
\[12]all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
\[13]So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Jehovah, because of the word of Jehovah, which he did not keep, and also because he asked counsel of a spiritist, to inquire thereby,
\[14]and did not inquire of Jehovah. Therefore he killed him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.

hen all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
\[2]In times past, even when Saul was king, it was thou who led out and brought in Israel. And Jehovah thy God said to thee, Thou shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shall be ruler over my people Israel.
\[3]So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron. And David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah. And they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of Jehovah by Samuel.
\[4]And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (the same is Jebus), and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.
\[5]And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shall not come in here. Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.
\[6]And David said, Whoever smites the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief.
\[7]And David dwelt in the stronghold. Therefore they called it the city of David.
\[8]And he built the city round about, from Millo even round about. And Joab repaired the rest of the city.
\[9]And David grew greater and greater, for Jehovah of hosts was with him.
\[10]Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of Jehovah concerning Israel.
\[11]And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty. He lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time.
\[12]And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.
\[13]He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a plot of ground full of barley. And the people fled from before the Philistines.
\[14]And they stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines. And Jehovah saved them by a great victory.
\[15]And three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David into the cave of Adullam. And the army of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
\[16]And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
\[17]And David longed, and said, Oh that a man would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
\[18]And the three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David. But David would not drink of it, but poured it out to Jehovah,

\[2]They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow. They were of Saul's brothers of Benjamin.
\[3]The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite, and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth, and Beracah, and Jehu the Anathothite,
\[4]and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty, and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite,

\[6]Elkanah, and Isshiah, and Azarel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites,
\[7]and Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
\[8]And of the Gadites there separated themselves to David to the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men trained for war, who could handle shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the roes upon the mountains:
\[9]Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
\[10]Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
\[11]Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
\[12]Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
\[13]Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh.
\[14]These of the sons of Gad were captains of the army. He who was least was equal to a hundred, and the greatest to a thousand.
\[15]These are those who went over the Jordan in the first month when it had overflowed all its banks. And they put to flight all those of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.
\[16]And there came of the sons of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold to David.
\[17]And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If ye have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you, but if ye be come to betray me to my adversaries, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.
\[18]Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, and he said, We are thine, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse. Peace, peace be to thee, and peace be to thy helpers, for thy God helps thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.
\[19]From Manasseh also there fell away some to David when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle. But they did not help them, for the lords of the Philistines sent him away upon advisement, saying, He will fall away to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.
\[20]As he went to Ziklag, there came to him from Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who were of Manasseh.
\[21]And they helped David against the band of rovers, for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the army.
\[22]For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great host, like the host of God.
\[23]And these are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of Jehovah.
\[24]The sons of Judah who bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, armed for war.
\[25]Of the sons of Simeon, mighty men of valor for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.
\[26]Of the sons of Levi four thousand and six hundred.
\[27]And Jehoiada was the leader of the house of Aaron. And with him were three thousand and seven hundred,
\[28]and Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his father's house twenty-two captains.
\[29]And of the sons of Benjamin, the brothers of Saul, three thousand, for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul.
\[30]And of the sons of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men in their fathers' houses.
\[31]And of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and make David king.
\[32]And of the sons of Issachar, men who had understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to do, the heads of them were two hundred. And all their brothers were at their commandment.
\[33]Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, with all manner of instruments of war, fifty thousand, and who could order the battle array, and were not of double heart.
\[34]And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them thirty-seven thousand with shield and spear.
\[35]And of the Danites who could set the battle in array, twenty-eight thousand and six hundred.
\[36]And of Asher, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, forty thousand.
\[37]And on the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, a hundred and twenty thousand.
\[38]All these being men of war, who could order the battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel. And all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.
\[39]And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their brothers had made preparation for them.
\[40]Moreover those who were near to them, even as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, provisions of meal, cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance, for there was joy in Israel.

\[2]And David said to all the assembly of Israel, If it seems good to you, and if it be of Jehovah our God, let us send abroad everywhere to our brothers who are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have suburbs, that they may gather themselves to us.
\[3]And let us bring again the ark of our God to us, for we did not inquire from it in the days of Saul.
\[4]And all the assembly said that they would do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
\[5]So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor the brook of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
\[6]And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is to Kiriath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, Jehovah who sits above the cherubim that is called by the Name.
\[7]And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab. And Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.
\[8]And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
\[9]And when they came to the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled.
\[10]And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him because he put forth his hand to the ark. And there he died before God.
\[11]And David was displeased, because Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzza. And he called that place Perez-uzza, to this day.
\[12]And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?
\[13]So David did not move the ark to him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
\[14]And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And Jehovah blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.

\[3]And David took more wives at Jerusalem, and David begot more sons and daughters.
\[4]And these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
\[5]and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,
\[6]and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
\[7]and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
\[8]And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went out against them.
\[9]Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.
\[10]And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? And will thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said to him, Go up, for I will deliver them into thy hand.
\[11]So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there. And David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
\[12]And they left their gods there. And David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.
\[13]And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.
\[14]And David inquired again of God. And God said to him, Thou shall not go up after them. Turn away from them, and come upon them opposite the mulberry trees.
\[15]And it shall be, when thou hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shall go out to battle. For God has gone out before thee to smite the army of the Philistines.
\[16]And David did as God commanded him, and they smote the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.

\[2]Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites, for Jehovah has them chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister to him forever.
\[3]And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of Jehovah to its place, which he had prepared for it.
\[4]And David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites:
\[5]of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers a hundred and twenty;
\[6]of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred and twenty;
\[7]of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brothers a hundred and thirty;
\[8]of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred;
\[9]of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brothers eighty;
\[10]of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers a hundred and twelve.
\[11]And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab.
\[12]And said to them, Ye are the heads of the fathers of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brothers, that ye may bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it.
\[13]For because ye did not at the first, Jehovah our God made a breach upon us, because we did not seek him according to the ordinance.
\[14]So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
\[15]And the sons of the Levites bore the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of Jehovah.
\[16]And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers, with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy.
\[17]So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel. And of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah. And of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah.
\[18]And with them their brothers of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters.
\[19]So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed with cymbals of brass to sound aloud.
\[20]And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries set to Alamoth.
\[21]And Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps set to the Sheminith, to lead.
\[22]And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song. He instructed about the song because he was skilful.
\[23]And Berechiah and Elkanah were porters for the ark.
\[24]And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before the ark of God. And Obed-edom and Jehiah were porters for the ark.
\[25]So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.
\[26]And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, that they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams.
\[27]And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites who bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers. And David had upon him an ephod of linen.
\[28]Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with psalteries and harps.
\[29]And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing. And she despised him in her heart.

\[3]And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion of flesh, and a cake of raisins.

\[9]Sing to him. Sing praises to him. Talk ye of all his marvelous works.
\[10]Glory ye in his holy name. Let the heart of those who seek Jehovah rejoice.
\[11]Seek ye Jehovah and his strength. Seek his face evermore.
\[12]Remember his marvelous works that he has done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,
\[13]O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.
\[14]He is Jehovah our God. His judgments are in all the earth.
\[15]Remember his covenant forever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,
\[16]the covenant which he made with Abraham, and his oath to Isaac,
\[17]and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant,
\[18]saying, To thee I will give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance,
\[19]when ye were but a few men in number, yea, very few, and sojourners in it,
\[20]and they went about from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people.
\[21]He allowed no man to do them wrong. Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
\[22]saying, Touch not my anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm.
\[23]Sing to Jehovah, all the earth. Show forth his salvation from day to day.
\[24]Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples.
\[25]For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised. He also is to be feared above all gods.
\[26]For all the gods of the peoples are idols. But Jehovah made the heavens.
\[27]Honor and majesty are before him. Strength and gladness are in his place.
\[28]Ascribe to Jehovah, ye kindred of the peoples. Ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength.
\[29]Ascribe to Jehovah the glory due to his name. Bring an offering, and come before him. Worship Jehovah in holy array.
\[30]Tremble before him, all the earth. The world also is established that it cannot be moved.
\[31]Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice. And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigns.
\[32]Let the sea roar, and the fullness of it. Let the field exult, and all that is therein.
\[33]Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before Jehovah, for he comes to judge the earth.
\[34]O give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good, for his loving kindness is forever.
\[35]And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation. And gather us together and deliver us from the nations, to give thanks to thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.
\[36]Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Truly, and praised Jehovah.
\[37]So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, Asaph and his brothers, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required,
\[38]and Obed-edom with their sixty-eight brothers. And Obed-edom the son of Jeduthun and Hosah were to be porters,
\[39]and Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was at Gibeon,
\[40]to offer burnt offerings to Jehovah upon the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he commanded to Israel.

\[2]And Nathan said to David, Do all that is in thy heart, for God is with thee.
\[3]And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
\[4]Go and tell David my servant, Thus says Jehovah, Thou shall not build for me a house to dwell in.
\[5]For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.
\[6]In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built for me a house of cedar?
\[7]Now therefore thus thou shall say to my servant David, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepfold, from following the sheep, that thou should be prince over my people Israel.
\[8]And I have been with thee wherever thou have gone, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee. And I will make thee a name like the name of the great ones who are on the earth.
\[9]And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more. Neither shall the sons of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,
\[10]and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. And I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build for thee a house.
\[11]And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons. And I will establish his kingdom.
\[12]He shall build for me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.
\[13]I will be his father, and he shall be my son. And I will not take my loving kindness away from him as I took it from him who was before thee.
\[14]But I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne shall be established forever.
\[15]According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
\[16]Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah. And he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, that thou have brought me thus far?
\[17]And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God. But thou have spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.
\[18]What can David say yet more to thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? For thou know thy servant.
\[19]O Jehovah, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, thou have wrought all this greatness, to make known all these great things.
\[20]O Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
\[21]And what one nation on the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make thee a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before thy people whom thou redeemed out of Egypt?
\[22]For thy people Israel thou made thine own people forever. And thou, Jehovah, became their God.
\[23]And now, O Jehovah, let the word that thou have spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as thou have spoken.
\[24]And let thy name be established and magnified forever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel, and the house of David thy servant is established before thee.
\[25]For thou, O my God, have revealed to thy servant that thou will build him a house. Therefore thy servant has found in his heart to pray before thee.
\[26]And now, O Jehovah, thou are God, and have promised this good thing to thy servant,
\[27]and now it has pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Jehovah, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.

\[6]And when the sons of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the sons of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah.
\[7]So they hired for them thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the sons of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.
\[8]And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men.
\[9]And the sons of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city. And the kings that came were by themselves in the field.
\[10]Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him in front and behind, he chose from all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.
\[11]And the rest of the company he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother, and they put themselves in array against the sons of Ammon.
\[12]And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shall help me, but if the sons of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.
\[13]Be of good courage, and let us act the man for our people, and for the cities of our God. And Jehovah do that which seems good to him.
\[14]So Joab and the company that were with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle, and they fled before him.
\[15]And when the sons of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
\[16]And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadarezer at their head.
\[17]And it was told David. And he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
\[18]And the Syrians fled before Israel. And David killed of the Syrians the men of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the army.
\[19]And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and served him, neither would the Syrians help the sons of Ammon any more.

nd it came to pass, at the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that Joab led forth the army, and wasted the country of the sons of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah, but David remained at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and overthrew it.
\[2]And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it. And it was set upon David's head, and he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceedingly much.
\[3]And he brought forth the people that were therein, and cut with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. And thus David did to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
\[4]And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai of the sons of the giant, and they were subdued.
\[5]And there was again war with the Philistines. And Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
\[6]And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature whose fingers and toes were twenty-four, six on each hand, and six on each foot. And he also was born to the giant.
\[7]And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother killed him.
\[8]These were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

nd Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.
\[2]And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan, and bring me word that I may know the sum of them.
\[3]And Joab said, Jehovah make his people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?
\[4]Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
\[5]And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David. And all those of Israel were a million and a hundred thousand men who drew a sword. And Judah was four hundred seventy thousand men who drew a sword.
\[6]But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king's word was abominable to Joab.
\[7]And God was displeased with this thing, therefore he smote Israel.
\[8]And David said to God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant, for I have done very foolishly.
\[9]And Jehovah spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,
\[10]Go and speak to David, saying, Thus says Jehovah, I offer thee three things. Choose thee one of them, that I may do it to thee.
\[11]So Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Take which thou will:
\[12]either three years of famine, or three months to be consumed before thy foes while the sword of thine enemies overtakes thee, or else three days the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence in the land, and the agent of Jehovah destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.
\[13]And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait. Let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Jehovah, for his mercies are very great, and let me not fall into the hand of man.
\[14]So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel, and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
\[15]And God sent an agent to Jerusalem to destroy it. And as he was about to destroy, Jehovah beheld, and he relented of the evil, and said to the destroying agent, It is enough. Now halt thy hand. And the agent of Jehovah was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\[16]And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the agent of Jehovah standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
\[17]And David said to God, Is it not I who commanded the people to be numbered? Even I it is who have sinned and done very badly. But these sheep, what have they done? Let thy hand, I pray thee, O Jehovah my God, be against me, and against my father's house, but not against thy people, that they should be plagued.
\[18]Then the agent of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up, and rear an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\[19]And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of Jehovah.
\[20]And Ornan turned back, and saw the agent, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
\[21]And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.
\[22]Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar to Jehovah. For the full price thou shall give it me, that the plague may be stopped from the people.
\[23]And Ornan said to David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Lo, I give thee the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.
\[24]And king David said to Ornan, No, but I will truly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is thine for Jehovah, nor offer a burnt offering without cost.
\[25]So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
\[26]And David built there an altar to Jehovah, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon Jehovah. And he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.
\[27]And Jehovah commanded the agent, and he put up his sword again into the sheath of it.
\[28]At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
\[29]For the tabernacle of Jehovah, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.
\[30]But David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid because of the sword of the agent of Jehovah.

hen David said, This is the house of Jehovah God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.
\[2]And David commanded to gather together the sojourners that were in the land of Israel. And he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.
\[3]And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings, and brass in abundance without weight,
\[4]and cedar trees without number. For the Sidonians and those of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David.
\[5]And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for Jehovah must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries. I will therefore make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.
\[6]Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for Jehovah, the God of Israel.
\[7]And David said to Solomon his son, As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Jehovah my God.
\[8]But the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, Thou have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars. Thou shall not build a house to my name because thou have shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.
\[9]Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest. And I will give him rest from all his enemies round about, for his name shall be Solomon. And I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.
\[10]He shall build a house for my name. And he shall be my son, and I will be his father, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.
\[11]Now, my son, Jehovah be with thee, and prosper thou, and build the house of Jehovah thy God as he has spoken concerning thee.
\[12]Only Jehovah give thee discretion and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, so that thou may keep the law of Jehovah thy God.
\[13]Then thou shall prosper, if thou observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Jehovah charged Moses with concerning Israel. Be strong, and of good courage. Fear not, neither be dismayed.
\[14]Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a million talents of silver, and of brass and iron without weight, for it is in abundance. Also I have prepared timber and stone, and thou may add thereto.
\[15]Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all men who are skilful in every manner of work.
\[16]Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and Jehovah be with thee.
\[17]David also commanded all the rulers of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
\[18]Is not Jehovah your God with you? And has he not given you rest on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land is subdued before Jehovah, and before his people.
\[19]Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Jehovah your God. Arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of Jehovah God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of Jehovah.

ow David was old and full of days, and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
\[2]And he gathered together all the rulers of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
\[3]And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward. And their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand.
\[4]Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Jehovah. And six thousand were officers and judges,
\[5]and four thousand were porters, and four thousand praised Jehovah with the instruments which I made, David said, to praise therewith.
\[6]And David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
\[7]Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.
\[8]The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
\[9]The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers of Ladan.
\[10]And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
\[11]And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second. But Jeush and Beriah had not many sons. Therefore they became a fathers' house in one reckoning.
\[12]The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
\[13]The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. And Aaron was separated that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, forever, to burn incense before Jehovah, to minister to him, and to bless in his name, forever.
\[14]But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.
\[15]The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.
\[16]The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.
\[17]And the sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
\[18]The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.
\[19]The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
\[20]The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.
\[21]The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
\[22]And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only. And their brothers the sons of Kish took them to wife.
\[23]The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
\[24]These were the sons of Levi after their fathers' houses, even the heads of the fathers of those of them that were counted, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the house of Jehovah, from twenty years old and upward.
\[25]For David said, Jehovah, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people, and he dwells in Jerusalem forever.
\[26]And also the Levites shall no more have need to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels of it for the service of it.
\[27]For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old and upward.
\[28]For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of God, also
\[29]for the showbread, and for the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all manner of measure and size.
\[30]And to stand every morning to thank and praise Jehovah, and likewise at evening.
\[31]And to offer all burnt offerings to Jehovah, on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Jehovah.
\[32]And that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brothers, for the service of the house of Jehovah.

\[17]of Levi, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel; of Aaron, Zadok;
\[18]of Judah, Elihu, one of the brothers of David; of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael;

\[21]of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah; of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner;
\[22]of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the captains of the tribes of Israel.
\[23]But David did not take the number of them from twenty years old and under, because Jehovah had said he would increase Israel like the stars of heaven.
\[24]Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but did not finish. And wrath came for this upon Israel. Neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king David.
\[25]And over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel. And over the treasures in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, was Jonathan the son of Uzziah.
\[26]And over those who did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub.
\[27]And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite. And over the increase of the vineyards for the wine-cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite.
\[28]And over the olive trees and the sycamore trees that were in the lowland was Baal-hanan the Gederite. And over the cellars of oil was Joash.
\[29]And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite. And over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai.
\[30]And over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite. And over the donkeys was Jehdeiah the Meronothite. And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite.
\[31]All these were the rulers of the substance which was king David's.
\[32]Also Jonathan, David's uncle, was a counselor, a man of understanding, and a scribe. And Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons.
\[33]And Ahithophel was the king's counselor. And Hushai the Archite was the king's friend.
\[34]And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar. And the captain of the king's army was Joab.

nd David assembled all the rulers of Israel, the rulers of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that served the king by division, and the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers, and the mighty men, even all the mighty men of valor, to Jerusalem.
\[2]Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brothers, and my people. As for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and for the footstool of our God. And I had made ready for the building.
\[3]But God said to me, Thou shall not build a house for my name, because thou are a man of war, and have shed blood.
\[4]However Jehovah, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For he has chosen Judah to be ruler, and in the house of Judah, the house of my father, and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel.
\[5]And of all my sons (for Jehovah has given me many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of Jehovah over Israel.
\[6]And he said to me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.
\[7]And I will establish his kingdom forever, if he is constant to do my commandments and my ordinances, as at this day.
\[8]Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Jehovah, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Jehovah your God, that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your sons after you forever.
\[9]And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind, for Jehovah searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou seek him, he will be found by thee, but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off forever.
\[10]Take heed now, for Jehovah has chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong, and do it.
\[11]Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch of the temple, and of the houses of it, and of the treasuries of it, and of the upper rooms of it, and of the inner chambers of it, and of the place of the mercy-seat,
\[12]and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts of the house of Jehovah, and for all the chambers round about, for the treasuries of the house of God, and for the treasuries of the dedicated things,
\[13]also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and for all the vessels of service in the house of Jehovah,
\[14]of gold by weight for the vessels of gold, for all vessels of every kind of service; of silver for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service,
\[15]by weight also for the lampstands of gold, and for the lamps of it, of gold, by weight for every lampstand and for the lamps of it, and for the lampstands of silver, silver by weight for every lampstand and for the lamps of it, according to the use of every lampstand,
\[16]and the gold by weight for the tables of showbread, for every table, and silver for the tables of silver,
\[17]and the flesh-hooks, and the basins, and the cups, of pure gold, and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl, and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl,
\[18]and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight, and gold for the pattern of the chariot, even the cherubim that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.
\[19]All this, David said, I have been made to understand in writing from the hand of Jehovah, even all the works of this pattern.
\[20]And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it. Fear not, nor be dismayed, for Jehovah God, even my God, is with thee. He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until all the work for the service of the house of Jehovah be finished.
\[21]And, behold, there are the courses of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God. And there shall be with thee in all manner of work every willing man who has skill, for any manner of service. Also the captains and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.

nd David the king said to all the assembly, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great, for the palace is not for man, but for Jehovah God.
\[2]Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the things of gold, and the silver for the things of silver, and the brass for the things of brass, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, onyx stones, and stones to be set, stones for inlaid work, and of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
\[3]Moreover also, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,
\[4]even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, with which to overlay the walls of the houses,
\[5]of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artisans. Who then offers willingly to consecrate himself this day to Jehovah?
\[6]Then the rulers of the fathers, and the rulers of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's work, offered willingly.
\[7]And they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents.
\[8]And those with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Jehovah under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
\[9]Then the people rejoiced, because they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Jehovah. And David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
\[10]Therefore David praised Jehovah before all the assembly. And David said, Blessed be thou, O Jehovah, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.
\[11]Thine, O Jehovah, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and on the earth is thine. Thine is the kingdom, O Jehovah, and thou are exalted as head above all.
\[12]Both riches and honor come of thee, and thou rule over all. And in thy hand is power and might. And in thy hand it is to make great, and to give strength to all.
\[13]Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.
\[14]But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? For all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.
\[15]For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding.
\[16]O Jehovah our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name comes of thy hand, and is all thine own.
\[17]I know also, my God, that thou try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things. And now I have seen with joy thy people, who are present here, offer willingly to thee.
\[18]O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart to thee.
\[19]And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace for thee, for which I have made provision.
\[20]And David said to all the assembly, Now praise Jehovah your God. And all the assembly praised Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and did obeisance to Jehovah, and the king.
\[21]And they sacrificed sacrifices to Jehovah, and offered burnt offerings to Jehovah on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,
\[22]and ate and drank before Jehovah on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him to Jehovah to be prince, and Zadok to be priest.
\[23]Then Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.
\[24]And all the rulers, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king.
\[25]And Jehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
\[26]Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
\[27]And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
\[28]And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor. And Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
\[29]Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,
\[30]with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.

nd Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom. And Jehovah his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.
\[2]And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every ruler in all Israel, the heads of the fathers.
\[3]So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon. For the tent of meeting of God was there, which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness.
\[4]But the ark of God David had brought up from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it. For he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
\[5]Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Jehovah. And Solomon and the assembly sought to it.
\[6]And Solomon went up there to the brazen altar before Jehovah, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.
\[7]In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give thee.
\[8]And Solomon said to God, Thou have shown great loving kindness to David my father, and have made me king in his stead.
\[9]Now, O Jehovah God, let thy promise to David my father be established. For thou have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.
\[10]Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people. For who can judge this thy people, that is so great?
\[11]And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou have not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of those who hate thee, neither yet have asked long life, but have asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou may judge my people over whom I have made thee king,
\[12]wisdom and knowledge are granted to thee. And I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had who have been before thee, neither shall any after thee have the like.
\[13]So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem, and he reigned over Israel.
\[14]And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen. And he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\[15]And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars he made to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.
\[16]And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt. The king's merchants received them in herds, each herd at a price.
\[17]And they went after and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. And so they brought them out by their means for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria.

ow Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.
\[2]And Solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand men who were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
\[3]And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build for him a house to dwell therein, so with me.
\[4]Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God. This is an ordinance forever to Israel.
\[5]And the house which I build is great. For our God is great above all gods.
\[6]But who is able to build for him a house, seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? Who am I then, that I should build for him a house, except only to burn incense before him?
\[7]Now therefore send me a man skilful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave engravings, to be with the skilful men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.
\[8]Send to me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon. For I know that thy servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. And, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,
\[9]even to prepare for me timber in abundance. For the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful.
\[10]And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers who cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
\[11]Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Jehovah loves his people, he has made thee king over them.
\[12]Huram said moreover, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endued with discretion and understanding, that should build a house for Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.
\[13]And now I have sent a skilful man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,
\[14]the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan. And his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any manner of engraving, and to devise any device, that there may be a place appointed to him with thy skilful men, and with the skilful men of my lord David thy father.
\[15]Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants.
\[16]And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shall need. And we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa, and thou shall carry it up to Jerusalem.
\[17]And Solomon numbered all the aliens that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them. And they were found a hundred and fifty-three thousand and six hundred.
\[18]And he set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens, and eighty thousand who were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people to work.

hen Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where Jehovah appeared to David his father, which he made ready in the place that David had appointed, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\[2]And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
\[3]Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
\[4]And the porch that was before the house, the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty. And he overlaid it inside with pure gold.
\[5]And the greater house he ceiled with fir-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and wrought thereon palm trees and chains.
\[6]And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty. And the gold was gold of Parvaim.
\[7]He also overlaid the house, the beams, the thresholds, and the walls of it, and the doors of it, with gold, and engraved cherubim on the walls.
\[8]And he made the most holy house; the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty cubits. And he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.
\[9]And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
\[10]And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work, and they overlaid them with gold.
\[11]And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long; the wing of the one was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house, and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
\[12]And the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house, and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.
\[13]The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits. And they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house.
\[14]And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon.
\[15]Also he made two pillars before the house of thirty-five cubits in length, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.
\[16]And he made chains in the oracle, and put them on the tops of the pillars. And he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.
\[17]And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. And called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.

oreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length of it, and twenty cubits the breadth of it, and ten cubits the height of it.
\[2]Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass. And the height of it was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits encompassed it round about.
\[3]And under it was the likeness of oxen, which compassed it round about for ten cubits, encompassing the sea round about. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.
\[4]It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east. And the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.
\[5]And it was a handbreadth thick. And the brim of it was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It received and held three thousand baths.
\[6]He also made ten basins, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them. They washed in them such things as belonged to the burnt offering, but the sea was for the priests to wash in.
\[7]And he made the ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them. And he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
\[8]He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold.
\[9]Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
\[10]And he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.
\[11]And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of God:
\[12]the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,
\[13]and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars.
\[14]He also made the bases, and he made the lavers upon the bases,
\[15]one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.
\[16]Also the pots, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all the vessels of it, Huram his father made of bright brass for king Solomon for the house of Jehovah.
\[17]The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.
\[18]Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance. For the weight of the brass could not be found out.
\[19]And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God, also the golden altar, and the tables on which was the showbread,
\[20]and the lampstands with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold,
\[21]and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold,
\[22]and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold. And as for the entry of the house, the inner doors of it for the most holy place, and the doors of the house, namely, of the temple, were of gold.

hus all the work that Solomon wrought for the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.
\[2]Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the rulers of the fathers of the sons of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.
\[3]And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, which was in the seventh month.
\[4]And all the elders of Israel came. And the Levites took up the ark.
\[5]And they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent. These the priests the Levites brought up.
\[6]And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled to him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.
\[7]And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.
\[8]For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves of it above.
\[9]And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle, but they were not seen outside. And there it is to this day.
\[10]There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets which Moses put there at Horeb when Jehovah made a covenant with the sons of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
\[11]And it came to pass, when the priests came out of the holy place, (for all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their divisions.
\[12]Also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brothers, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets),
\[13]it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah. And when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah, saying, For he is good. For his loving kindness is forever, that the house was then filled with a cloud, even the house of Jehovah,
\[14]so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud. For the glory of Jehovah filled the house of God.

hen Solomon spoke, Jehovah has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
\[2]But I have built for thee a house of habitation, and a place for thee to dwell in forever.
\[3]And the king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel. And all the assembly of Israel stood.
\[4]And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hands fulfilled it, saying,
\[5]Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in that my name might be there. Neither did I choose any man to be ruler over my people Israel.
\[6]But I have chosen Jerusalem that my name might be there. And have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
\[7]Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
\[8]But Jehovah said to David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou did well that it was in thy heart.
\[9]Nevertheless thou shall not build the house, but thy son who shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.
\[10]And Jehovah has performed his word that he spoke. For I have risen up in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
\[11]And there I have set the ark in which is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with the sons of Israel.
\[12]And he stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands.
\[13]For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court. And upon it he stood, and knelt down upon his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven.
\[14]And he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven, or on earth, who keep covenant and loving kindness with thy servants, who walk before thee with all their heart,
\[15]who have kept with thy servant David my father that which thou promised him. Yea, thou spoke with thy mouth, and have fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.
\[16]Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou have promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy sons take heed to their way, to walk in my law as thou have walked before me.
\[17]Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou spoke to thy servant David.
\[18]But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee. How much less this house which I have built!
\[19]Yet have thou respect to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken to the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prays before thee,
\[20]that thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place of which thou have said that thou would put thy name there, to hearken to the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place.

\[22]If a man sins against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swears before thine altar in this house,
\[23]then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, requiting the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
\[24]And if thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house,
\[25]then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again to the land which thou gave to them and to their fathers.
\[26]When the heavens are shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee, if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin when thou do afflict them,

\[29]whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house,
\[30]then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling-place and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou know, (for thou, even thou only, know the hearts of the sons of men),
\[31]that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways so long as they live in the land which thou gave to our fathers.
\[32]Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come from a far country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thine outstretched arm, when they shall come and pray toward this house,
\[33]then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to thee for, that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as do thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
\[34]If thy people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way thou shall send them, and they pray to thee toward this city which thou have chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name,
\[35]then hear thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
\[36]If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sins not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near,
\[37]yet if they shall rethink themselves in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly,
\[38]if they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity where they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which thou gave to their fathers, and the city which thou have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name,
\[39]then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their case, and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee.
\[40]Now, O my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attendant to the prayer that is made in this place.
\[41]Now therefore arise, O Jehovah God, into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength. Let thy priests, O Jehovah God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy sanctified rejoice in goodness.
\[42]O Jehovah God, do not turn away the face of thine anointed. Remember thy loving kindnesses to David thy servant.

ow when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices. And the glory of Jehovah filled the house.
\[2]And the priests could not enter into the house of Jehovah, because the glory of Jehovah filled Jehovah's house.
\[3]And all the sons of Israel looked on when the fire came down, and the glory of Jehovah was upon the house. And they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshiped, and gave thanks to Jehovah, saying, For he is good. For his loving kindness is forever.
\[4]Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before Jehovah.
\[5]And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
\[6]And the priests stood according to their offices, also the Levites with instruments of music of Jehovah, which David the king had made to give thanks to Jehovah (for his loving kindness is forever) when David praised by their ministry, and the priests sounded trumpets before them. And all Israel stood.
\[7]Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah. For there he offered the burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat.
\[8]So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt.
\[9]And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly. For they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.
\[10]And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Jehovah had shown to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.
\[11]Thus Solomon finished the house of Jehovah, and the king's house. And all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he caused to prosper.
\[12]And Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.
\[13]If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people,
\[14]if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
\[15]Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attend to the prayer that is made in this place.
\[16]For now I have chosen and hallowed this house, that my name may be there forever, and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
\[17]And as for thee, if thou will walk before me as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and will keep my statutes and mine ordinances,
\[18]then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.
\[19]But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them,
\[20]then I will pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them. And this house, which I have hallowed for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
\[21]And this house, which is so high, everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall say, Why has Jehovah done thus to this land, and to this house?
\[22]And they shall answer, Because they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them, and served them; therefore he has brought all this evil upon them.

nd it came to pass at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of Jehovah, and his own house,
\[2]that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the sons of Israel to dwell there.
\[3]And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.
\[4]And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store-cities, which he built in Hamath.
\[5]Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the lower, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars,
\[6]and Baalath, and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
\[7]As for all the people who were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, that were not of Israel,
\[8]of their sons who were left after them in the land whom the sons of Israel did not consumed, of them Solomon raised a levy of bondservants to this day.
\[9]But Solomon made no servants of the sons of Israel for his work, but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.
\[10]And these were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two hundred and fifty that bore rule over the people.
\[11]And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David to the house that he had built for her. For he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy in which the ark of Jehovah has come.
\[12]Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah, which he had built before the porch,
\[13]even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.
\[14]And he appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the divisions of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required, also the porters by their divisions at every gate. For so David the man of God had commanded.
\[15]And they did not depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
\[16]Now all the work of Solomon was prepared from the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah, and until it was finished. So the house of Jehovah was completed.
\[17]Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom.
\[18]And Huram sent ships to him by the hands of his servants, and servants who had knowledge of the sea. And they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.

\[2]And Solomon answered to her all her questions. And there was not anything hid from Solomon that he did not answer her.
\[3]And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
\[4]and the food of his table, and the seating of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, also his cupbearers, and their apparel, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Jehovah, there was no more spirit in her.
\[5]And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.
\[6]However I did not believe their words until I came, and my eyes had seen it. And, behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me. Thou exceed the fame that I heard.
\[7]Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.
\[8]Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on his throne to be king for Jehovah thy God. Because thy God loved Israel, to establish them forever, therefore he made thee king over them, to do justice and righteousness.
\[9]And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones. Neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
\[10]And also the servants of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.
\[11]And the king made of the algum trees terraces for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, and harps and psalteries for the singers. And there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.
\[12]And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which she had brought to the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.
\[13]Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,
\[14]besides that which the traders and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
\[15]And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one buckler.
\[16]And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
\[17]Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
\[18]And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and supports on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the supports.
\[19]And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.
\[20]And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; silver was accounted of nothing in the days of Solomon.
\[21]For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram. Once every three years the ships of Tarshish came, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
\[22]So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
\[23]And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
\[24]And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
\[25]And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\[26]And he ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
\[27]And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.
\[28]And they brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
\[29]Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
\[30]And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.

nd Rehoboam went to Shechem. For all Israel came to Shechem to make him king.
\[2]And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was in Egypt, from where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon), that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.
\[3]And they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
\[4]Thy father made our yoke grievous. Now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
\[5]And he said to them, Come again to me after three days. And the people departed.
\[6]And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel do ye give me to return an answer to this people?
\[7]And they spoke to him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants forever.
\[8]But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that grew up with him, who stood before him.
\[9]And he said to them, What counsel do ye give, that we may return an answer to this people who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father put upon us lighter?
\[10]And the young men that grew up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall thou say to the people who spoke to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter to us. Thus shall thou say to them, My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.
\[11]And now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I with scorpions.
\[12]So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.
\[13]And the king answered them roughly. And king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
\[14]and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto. My father chastised you with whips, but I with scorpions.
\[15]So the king did not hearken to the people. For it was brought about by God, that Jehovah might establish his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\[16]And when all Israel saw that the king did not hearken to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to your tents, O Israel. Now see to thine own house, David. So all Israel departed to their tents.
\[17]But as for the sons of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
\[18]Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to task work. And the sons of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.

\[2]But the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
\[3]Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
\[4]Thus says Jehovah, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers. Return every man to his house. For this thing is of me. So they hearkened to the words of Jehovah, and returned from going against Jeroboam.
\[5]And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.
\[6]He built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
\[7]And Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,
\[8]and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
\[9]and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
\[10]and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.
\[11]And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of victuals, and oil and wine.
\[12]And in every city he put shields and spears, and made them exceedingly strong. And Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.
\[13]And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.
\[14]For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem. For Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest's office to Jehovah.
\[15]And he appointed priests for him for the high places, and for the he-goats, and for the calves which he had made.
\[16]And after them, such as set their hearts to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem out of all the tribes of Israel to sacrifice to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
\[17]So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong three years. For they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.
\[18]And Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse.
\[19]And she bore sons for him: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.
\[20]And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom. And she bore for him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
\[21]And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines. For he took eighteen wives, and thirty concubines, and begot twenty-eight sons and thirty daughters.
\[22]And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, the ruler among his brothers. For he intended to make him king.
\[23]And he dealt wisely, and dispersed all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city. And he gave them provisions in abundance. And he sought for them many wives.

nd it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him.
\[2]And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Jehovah,
\[3]with twelve hundred chariots, and thirty thousand horsemen. And the people were without number who came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.
\[4]And he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.
\[5]Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the rulers of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus says Jehovah, Ye have forsaken me, therefore I have also left you in the hand of Shishak.
\[6]Then the rulers of Israel and the king humbled themselves, and they said, Jehovah is righteous.
\[7]And when Jehovah saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
\[8]Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
\[9]So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all away. He also took away the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
\[10]And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard that kept the door of the king's house.
\[11]And it was so, that, as often as the king entered into the house of Jehovah, the guard came and bore them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.
\[12]And when he humbled himself, the wrath of Jehovah turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether. And moreover in Judah there were good things.
\[13]So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned. For Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
\[14]And he did that which was evil, because he did not set his heart to seek Jehovah.
\[15]Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.

n the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah.
\[2]He reigned three years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
\[3]And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men. And Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men who were mighty men of valor.
\[4]And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel.
\[5]Should ye not know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
\[6]Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.
\[7]And there were gathered to him worthless men, base fellows, who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.
\[8]And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David, and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.
\[9]Have ye not driven out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests for you after the manner of the peoples of other lands? So that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.
\[10]But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him. And we have priests ministering to Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work.
\[11]And they burn to Jehovah every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense. Also they set the showbread in order upon the pure table, and the lampstand of gold with the lamps of it to burn every evening. For we keep the charge of Jehovah our God, but ye have forsaken him.
\[12]And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O sons of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers. For ye shall not prosper.
\[13]But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come around behind them, so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.
\[14]And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them. And they cried to Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
\[15]Then the men of Judah gave a shout. And as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
\[16]And the sons of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand.
\[17]And Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter. So there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
\[18]Thus the sons of Israel were brought under at that time, and the sons of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
\[19]And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns of it, and Jeshanah with the towns of it, and Ephron with the towns of it.
\[20]Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah. And Jehovah smote him, and he died.
\[21]But Abijah grew mighty, and took to himself fourteen wives, and begot twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters.

\[2]And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God.
\[3]For he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and broke down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,
\[4]and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.
\[5]Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images. And the kingdom was quiet before him.
\[6]And he built fortified cities in Judah. For the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest.
\[7]For he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars. The land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God. We have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.
\[8]And Asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand, and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand. All these were mighty men of valor.
\[9]And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a million, and three hundred chariots. And he came to Mareshah.
\[10]Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
\[11]And Asa cried to Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him who has no strength. Help us, O Jehovah our God. For we rely on thee, and in thy name we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou are our God. Let not man prevail against thee.
\[12]So Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah. And the Ethiopians fled.
\[13]And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar. And there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves. For they were destroyed before Jehovah, and before his army. And they carried away very much booty.
\[14]And they smote all the cities round about Gerar. For the fear of Jehovah came upon them. And they despoiled all the cities. For there was much spoil in them.

\[2]And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin. Jehovah is with you while ye are with him. And if ye seek him, he will be found of you, but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.
\[3]Now for a long time Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.
\[4]But when in their distress they turned to Jehovah, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them.
\[5]And in those times there was no peace to him who went out, nor to him who came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the lands.
\[6]And they were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city. For God vexed them with all adversity.
\[7]But be ye strong, and let not your hands be slack. For your work shall be rewarded.
\[8]And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim. And he renewed the altar of Jehovah, that was before the porch of Jehovah.
\[9]And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon, for they came to him out of Israel in abundance when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him.
\[10]So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
\[11]And they sacrificed to Jehovah in that day of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
\[12]And they entered into the covenant to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul.
\[13]And that whoever would not seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
\[14]And they swore to Jehovah with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
\[15]And all Judah rejoiced at the oath. For they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire, and he was found by them. And Jehovah gave them rest round about.
\[16]And also he removed Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah. And Asa cut down her image, and made dust of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
\[17]But the high places were not taken away out of Israel. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
\[18]And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.
\[19]And there was no more war to the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.

n the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
\[2]Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Jehovah and of the king's house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, who dwelt at Damascus, saying,
\[3]There is a league between me and thee, as between my father and thy father. Behold, I have sent thee silver and gold. Go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel that he may depart from me.
\[4]And Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel. And they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtali.
\[5]And it came to pass, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease.
\[6]Then Asa the king took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber of it, with which Baasha had built. And he built Geba and Mizpah with it.
\[7]And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because thou have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on Jehovah thy God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped out of thy hand.
\[8]Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army, with chariots and horsemen exceedingly many? Yet, because thou relied on Jehovah, he delivered them into thy hand.
\[9]For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is perfect toward him. In this thou have done foolishly, for from henceforth thou shall have wars.
\[10]Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison-house. For he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.
\[11]And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\[12]And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet. His disease was exceedingly great, yet in his disease he did not seek for Jehovah, but to the physicians.
\[13]And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the forty-first year of his reign.
\[14]And they buried him in his own sepulchers, which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers' art. And they made a very great burning for him.

\[2]And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.
\[3]And Jehovah was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the former ways of his father David, and did not seek for the Baalim,
\[4]but sought for the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.
\[5]Therefore Jehovah established the kingdom in his hand. And all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute, and he had riches and honor in abundance.
\[6]And his heart was lifted up in the ways of Jehovah. And furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.
\[7]Also in the third year of his reign he sent his rulers, even Ben-hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;
\[8]and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.
\[9]And they taught in Judah, having the book of the law of Jehovah with them. And they went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught among the people.
\[10]And the fear of Jehovah fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.
\[11]And some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute. The Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he-goats.
\[12]And Jehoshaphat grew exceedingly great. And he built in Judah castles and cities of storage.
\[13]And he had many works in the cities of Judah, and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.
\[14]And this was the numbering of them according to their fathers' houses. Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor;
\[15]and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand;
\[16]and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to Jehovah, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.
\[17]And of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;
\[18]and next to him Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and eighty thousand ready prepared for war.
\[19]These were those who waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.

ow Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance. And he joined affinity with Ahab.
\[2]And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people who were with him, and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth-gilead.
\[3]And Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Will thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I am as thou are, and my people as thy people, and will be with thee in the war.
\[4]And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah.
\[5]Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up. For God will deliver it into the hand of the king.
\[6]But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?
\[7]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah, but I hate him. For he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil; the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
\[8]Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
\[9]Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah each sat on his throne, arrayed in their robes. And they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
\[10]And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for him horns of iron, and said, Thus says Jehovah, With these thou shall push the Syrians until they be consumed.
\[11]And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper. For Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.
\[12]And the messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets are good to the king with one mouth. Let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.
\[13]And Micaiah said, As Jehovah lives, what my God says, that will I speak.
\[14]And when he came to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.
\[15]And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?
\[16]And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And Jehovah said, These have no master. Let them return every man to his house in peace.
\[17]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
\[18]And Micaiah said, Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah. I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing at his right hand and at his left.
\[19]And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
\[20]And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him. And Jehovah said to him, With what?
\[21]And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shall entice him, and shall also prevail. Go forth, and do so.
\[22]Now therefore, behold, Jehovah has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets. And Jehovah has spoken evil concerning thee.
\[23]Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way did the Spirit of Jehovah go from me to speak to thee?
\[24]And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shall see on that day when thou shall go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
\[25]And the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son,
\[26]and say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.
\[27]And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah has not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.
\[28]So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
\[29]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle, but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into the battle.
\[30]Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.
\[31]And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they turned around to fight against him. But Jehoshaphat cried out. And Jehovah helped him, and God moved them from him.
\[32]And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
\[33]And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of the chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the army. For I am severely wounded.
\[34]And the battle increased that day. However the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening. And about the time of the going down of the sun he died.

\[3]Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou have put away the Asheroth out of the land, and have set thy heart to seek God.
\[4]And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem. And he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, and brought them back to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
\[5]And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,
\[6]and said to the judges, Consider what ye do. For ye judge not for man, but for Jehovah, and he is with you in the judgment.
\[7]Now therefore let the fear of Jehovah be upon you. Take heed and do it. For there is no iniquity with Jehovah our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.
\[8]Moreover in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat set from the Levites and the priests, and from the heads of the fathers of Israel for the judgment of Jehovah, and for controversies. And they returned to Jerusalem.
\[9]And he charged them, saying, Thus ye shall do in the fear of Jehovah, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.
\[10]And whenever any controversy shall come to you from your brothers who dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, ye shall warn them, that they not be guilty towards Jehovah, and so wrath come upon you and upon your brothers. Do this, and ye shall not be guilty.
\[11]And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Jehovah, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the king's matters. The Levites shall also be officers before you. Deal courageously, and Jehovah be with the good.

\[2]Then there came some who told Jehoshaphat, saying, There comes a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea from Syria. And, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar (the same is En-gedi).
\[3]And Jehoshaphat was afraid, and set himself to seek for Jehovah. And he proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
\[4]And Judah gathered themselves together, to seek help from Jehovah, even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek Jehovah.
\[5]And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of Jehovah before the new court.
\[6]And he said, O Jehovah, the God of our fathers, are thou not God in heaven? And are thou not ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? And in thy hand is power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee.
\[7]Did thou not, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and give it to the seed of Abraham thy friend forever?
\[8]And they dwelt therein, and have built for thee a sanctuary in it for thy name, saying,
\[9]If evil comes upon us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and before thee, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry out to thee in our affliction, and thou will hear and save.
\[10]And now, behold, the sons of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir (whom thou would not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and did not destroy them),
\[11]behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou have given us to inherit.
\[12]O our God, will thou not judge them? For we have no might against this great company that comes against us. Neither do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon thee.
\[13]And all Judah stood before Jehovah, with their little ones, their wives, and their sons.
\[14]Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of Jehovah in the midst of the assembly.
\[15]And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat. Thus says Jehovah to you, Fear ye not, neither be dismayed because of this great multitude. For the battle is not yours, but God's.
\[16]Tomorrow go ye down against them. Behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz. And ye shall find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.
\[17]Ye shall not need to fight in this battle. Set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of Jehovah with you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Fear not, nor be dismayed. Tomorrow go out against them, for Jehovah is with you.
\[18]And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground. And all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Jehovah, worshiping Jehovah.
\[19]And the Levites, of the sons of the Kohathites and of the sons of the Korahites, stood up to praise Jehovah, the God of Israel, with an exceedingly loud voice.
\[20]And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa. And as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem. Believe in Jehovah your God, so shall ye be established. Believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.
\[21]And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who should sing to Jehovah, and give praise in holy array, as they went out before the army, and say, Give thanks to Jehovah. For his loving kindness is forever.
\[22]And when they began to sing and to praise, Jehovah set an ambushment against the sons of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir who came against Judah, and they were smitten.
\[23]For the sons of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, to slay and destroy them utterly. And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another of themselves.
\[24]And when Judah came to the watch-tower of the wilderness, they looked upon the multitude. And, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none who escaped.
\[25]And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away. And they were three days in taking the spoil, it was so much.
\[26]And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah, for there they blessed Jehovah. Therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah to this day.
\[27]Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy. For Jehovah had made them to rejoice over their enemies.
\[28]And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets to the house of Jehovah.
\[29]And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Jehovah fought against the enemies of Israel.
\[30]So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet. For his God gave him rest round about.
\[31]And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign. And he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
\[32]And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and did not turn aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah.
\[33]However the high places were not taken away. Neither as yet had the people set their hearts to the God of their fathers.
\[34]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of the kings of Israel.
\[35]And after this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel. The same did very wickedly.
\[36]And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish. And they made the ships in Ezion-geber.
\[37]Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou have joined thyself with Ahaziah, Jehovah has destroyed thy works. And the ships were broken, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish.

\[2]And he had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
\[3]And their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah. But the kingdom he gave to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn.
\[4]Now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and also various of the rulers of Israel.
\[5]Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
\[6]And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.
\[7]However Jehovah would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons always.
\[8]In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
\[9]Then Jehoram passed over with his captains, and all his chariots with him. And he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that encompassed him around, and the captains of the chariots.
\[10]So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time from under his hand because he had forsaken Jehovah, the God of his fathers.
\[11]Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, and led Judah astray.
\[12]And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus says Jehovah, the God of David thy father, Because thou have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
\[13]but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, like the house of Ahab did, and also have slain thy brothers of thy father's house who were better than thyself,
\[14]behold, Jehovah will smite thy people with a great plague, and thy sons, and thy wives, and all thy substance.
\[15]And thou shall have great sickness by disease of thy bowels until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.
\[16]And Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians who are beside the Ethiopians.
\[17]And they came up against Judah, and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives, so that there has not been left a son to him, except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
\[18]And after all this Jehovah smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.
\[19]And it came to pass, in process of time, at the end of two years, that his bowels fell out because of his sickness, and he died of severe diseases. And his people made no burning for him like the burning of his fathers.
\[20]He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. And he departed without being wanted. And they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchers of the kings.

\[2]Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.
\[3]He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab. For his mother was his counselor to do wickedly.
\[4]And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did the house of Ahab. For they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction.
\[5]He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead. And the Syrians wounded Joram.
\[6]And he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel because he was sick.
\[7]Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went to Joram, for when he came he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.
\[8]And it came to pass, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, that he found the rulers of Judah, and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah, and killed them.
\[9]And he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria). And they brought him to Jehu, and killed him. And they buried him, for they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart. And the house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom.
\[10]Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of Judah.
\[11]But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's sons who were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she did not kill him.

\[2]And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
\[3]And all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as Jehovah has spoken concerning the sons of David.
\[4]This is the thing that ye shall do: A third part of you who come in on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the thresholds,
\[5]and a third part shall be at the king's house, and a third part at the gate of the foundation. And all the people shall be in the courts of the house of Jehovah.

\[7]And the Levites shall encompass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand. And whoever comes into the house, let him be slain. And be ye with the king when he comes in, and when he goes out.
\[8]So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And they took every man his men, those who were to come in on the sabbath, with those who were to go out on the sabbath. For Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss the divisions.
\[9]And Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God.
\[10]And he set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.
\[11]Then they brought out the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him. And they said, Live, O king.
\[12]And when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah.
\[13]And she looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king. And all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. The singers also played on instruments of music, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and said, Treason! treason!
\[14]And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, Have her forth between the ranks. And whoever follows her, let him be slain with the sword, for the priest said, Do not slay her in the house of Jehovah.
\[15]So they made way for her. And she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king's house, and they killed her there.
\[16]And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be Jehovah's people.
\[17]And all the people went to the house of Baal, and broke it down, and broke his altars and his images in pieces, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
\[18]And Jehoiada appointed the officers of the house of Jehovah under the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of Jehovah, to offer the burnt offerings of Jehovah, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, according to the order of David.
\[19]And he set the porters at the gates of the house of Jehovah that no man who was unclean in anything should enter in.
\[20]And he took the captains of hundreds, and the mighty men, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of Jehovah. And they came through the upper gate to the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.
\[21]So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. And they had slain Athaliah with the sword.

oash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zibiah, of Beersheba.
\[2]And Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
\[3]And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he begot sons and daughters.
\[4]And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to restore the house of Jehovah.
\[5]And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather money from all Israel to repair the house of your God from year to year. And see that ye hasten the matter. However the Levites did not hasten it.
\[6]And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, Why have thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of Jehovah, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?
\[7]For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God, and also all the dedicated things of the house of Jehovah they bestowed upon the Baalim.
\[8]So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the house of Jehovah.
\[9]And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for Jehovah the tax that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.
\[10]And all the rulers and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
\[11]And it was so, that, at what ever time the chest was brought to the king's officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the chief priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.
\[12]And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah. And they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of Jehovah, and also such as wrought iron and brass to repair the house of Jehovah.
\[13]So the workmen labored, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands, and they set up the house of God in its state, and strengthened it.
\[14]And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, from which were made vessels for the house of Jehovah, even vessels with which to minister and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of Jehovah continually all the days of Jehoiada.
\[15]But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died. He was a hundred and thirty years old when he died.
\[16]And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.
\[17]Now after the death of Jehoiada the rulers of Judah came, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened to them.
\[18]And they forsook the house of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols. And wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.
\[19]Yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again to Jehovah. And they testified against them, but they would not give ear.
\[20]And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest. And he stood above the people, and said to them, Thus says God, Why do ye transgress the commandments of Jehovah, so that ye cannot prosper? Because ye have forsaken Jehovah, he has also forsaken you.
\[21]And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of Jehovah.
\[22]Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son. And when he died, he said, Jehovah look upon it, and require it.
\[23]And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians came up against him. And they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the rulers of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them to the king of Damascus.
\[24]For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men. And Jehovah delivered a very great host into their hand because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers. So they executed judgment upon Joash.
\[25]And when they were departed from him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed, and he died. And they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the sepulchers of the kings.
\[26]And these are those who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.
\[27]Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the rebuilding of the house of God, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

maziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.
\[2]And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, but not with a perfect heart.
\[3]Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father.
\[4]But he did not put their sons to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the sons, neither shall the sons die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.
\[5]Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and appointed them according to their fathers' houses, for heads of thousands and heads of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin. And he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to war, who could handle spear and shield.
\[6]He also hired a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
\[7]But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee. For Jehovah is not with Israel, namely, with all the sons of Ephraim.
\[8]But if thou are going, do it. Be strong for the battle, because God will cast thee down before the enemy, for God has power to help, and to cast down.
\[9]And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, Jehovah is able to give thee much more than this.
\[10]Then Amaziah separated them, namely, the army that came to him out of Ephraim, to go home again. Therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.
\[11]And Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and smote ten thousand of the sons of Seir.
\[12]And the sons of Judah carried away ten thousand alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.
\[13]But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth-horon, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.
\[14]Now it came to pass, after Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the sons of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them.
\[15]Therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Amaziah. And he sent a prophet to him, who said to him, Why have thou sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?
\[16]And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said to him, Have we made thee of the king's counsel? Cease. Why should thou be smitten? Then the prophet ceased, and said, I know that God has determined to destroy thee, because thou have done this, and have not hearkened to my counsel.
\[17]Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look each other in the face.
\[18]And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife. And there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trampled down the thistle.
\[19]Thou say, Lo, I have smitten Edom. And thy heart lifts thee up to boast. Remain now at home. Why should thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou should fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
\[20]But Amaziah would not hear, for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.
\[21]So Joash king of Israel went up. And he and Amaziah king of Judah looked each other in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
\[22]And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.
\[23]And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
\[24]And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, also the hostages, and returned to Samaria.
\[25]And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
\[26]Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
\[27]Now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following Jehovah they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish, and killed him there.
\[28]And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.

nd all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah.
\[2]He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
\[3]Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem.
\[4]And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
\[5]And he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God. And as long as he sought Jehovah, God made him to prosper.
\[6]And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod. And he built cities in the country of Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
\[7]And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians who dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Meunim.
\[8]And the Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah. And his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt, for he grew exceedingly strong.
\[9]Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.
\[10]And he built towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many cisterns, for he had much cattle, also in the lowland and in the plain. And he had husbandmen and vinedressers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields, for he loved husbandry.
\[11]Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men who went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.
\[12]The whole number of the heads of fathers, even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand and six hundred.
\[13]And under their hand was an army, three hundred seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
\[14]And Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging.
\[15]And he made engines in Jerusalem, invented by skilful men, to be on the towers and upon the battlements, with which to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad. For he was marvelously helped, till he was strong.
\[16]But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Jehovah his God. For he went into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
\[17]And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of Jehovah, who were valiant men.
\[18]And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said to him, It does not pertain to thee, Uzziah, to burn incense to Jehovah, but to the priests the sons of Aaron who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary. For thou have trespassed, neither shall it be for thine honor from Jehovah God.
\[19]Then Uzziah was angry. And he had a censer in his hand to burn incense. And while he was angry with the priests, the leprosy broke forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of Jehovah, beside the altar of incense.
\[20]And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead. And they thrust him out quickly from there. Yea, he himself also hastened to go out, because Jehovah had smitten him.
\[21]And Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper. For he was cut off from the house of Jehovah, and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.
\[22]Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, wrote.
\[23]So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings. For they said, He is a leper. And Jotham his son reigned in his stead.

\[2]And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Uzziah had done. However he did not enter into the temple of Jehovah. And the people still did corruptly.
\[3]He built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.
\[4]Moreover he built cities in the hill-country of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.
\[5]Also he fought with the king of the sons of Ammon, and prevailed against them. And the sons of Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the sons of Ammon render to him, in the second year also, and in the third.

\[2]but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and also made molten images for the Baalim.
\[3]Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his sons in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the sons of Israel.
\[4]And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
\[5]Therefore Jehovah his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria. And they smote him, and carried away of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.
\[6]For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men, because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
\[7]And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah who was next to the king.
\[8]And the sons of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and also took away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
\[9]But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose name was Oded. And he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, because Jehovah, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he has delivered them into your hand. And ye have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heaven.
\[10]And now ye propose to keep under the sons of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen to you. Are there not even with you trespasses of your own against Jehovah your God?
\[11]Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives that ye have taken captive of your brothers. For the fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you.
\[12]Then certain of the heads of the sons of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war,
\[13]and said to them, Ye shall not bring in the captives here. For ye propose that which will bring upon us a trespass against Jehovah, to add to our sins and to our trespass. For our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.
\[14]So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the rulers and all the assembly.
\[15]And the men who have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all who were naked among them, and dressed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria.
\[16]At that time king Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him.
\[17]For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.
\[18]The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns of it, and Timnah with the towns of it, also Gimzo and the towns of it. And they dwelt there.
\[19]For Jehovah brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed severely against Jehovah.
\[20]And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him, but did not strengthen him.
\[21]For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Jehovah, and out of the house of the king and of the rulers, and gave it to the king of Assyria, but it did not help him.
\[22]And in the time of his distress he trespassed yet more against Jehovah, this same king Ahaz.
\[23]For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which smote him. And he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, therefore I will sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
\[24]And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah. And he made altars for him in every corner of Jerusalem.
\[25]And in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of his fathers.
\[26]Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\[27]And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem. For they did not bring him into the sepulchers of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

\[2]And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done.
\[3]In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired them.
\[4]And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,
\[5]and said to them, Hear me, ye Levites. Now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.
\[6]For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Jehovah, and turned their backs.
\[7]Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.
\[8]Therefore the wrath of Jehovah was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he has delivered them to be tossed to and fro, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as ye see with your eyes.
\[9]For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
\[10]Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Jehovah, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us.
\[11]My sons, be not now negligent. For Jehovah has chosen you to stand before him, to minister to him, and that ye should be his ministers, and burn incense.
\[12]Then the Levites arose: Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites, and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel, and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;
\[13]and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel, and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah,
\[14]and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei, and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
\[15]And they gathered their brothers, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.
\[16]And the priests went in to the inner part of the house of Jehovah to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah into the court of the house of Jehovah. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron.
\[17]Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of Jehovah. And they sanctified the house of Jehovah in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
\[18]Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace, and said, We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of burnt offering with all the vessels of it, and the table of showbread with all the vessels of it.
\[19]Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign cast away when he trespassed, we have prepared and sanctified. And, behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah.
\[20]Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah.
\[21]And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of Jehovah.
\[22]So they killed the bullocks. And the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar. And they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar. They also killed the lambs, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar.
\[23]And they brought near the he-goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly. And they laid their hands upon them,
\[24]and the priests killed them. And they made a sin offering with their blood upon the altar, to make atonement for all Israel. For the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.
\[25]And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet. For the commandment was of Jehovah by his prophets.
\[26]And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
\[27]And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of Jehovah began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David king of Israel.
\[28]And all the assembly worshiped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded. All this until the burnt offering was finished.
\[29]And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped.
\[30]Moreover Hezekiah the king and the rulers commanded the Levites to sing praises to Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped.
\[31]Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves to Jehovah. Come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of Jehovah. And the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings.
\[32]And the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs. All these were for a burnt offering to Jehovah.
\[33]And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
\[34]But the priests were too few, so that they could not skin all the burnt offerings. Therefore their brothers the Levites helped them till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves. For the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
\[35]And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order.
\[36]And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people; for the thing was done suddenly.

nd Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover to Jehovah, the God of Israel.
\[2]For the king had taken counsel, and his rulers, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the Passover in the second month.
\[3]For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
\[4]And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.
\[5]So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to Jehovah, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem. For they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written.
\[6]So the posts went with the letters from the king and his rulers throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye sons of Israel, turn again to Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant of you who escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.
\[7]And be ye not like your fathers, and like your brothers, who trespassed against Jehovah, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as ye see.
\[8]Now be ye not stiff-necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to Jehovah, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever, and serve Jehovah your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.
\[9]For if ye turn again to Jehovah, your brothers and your sons shall find compassion before those who led them captive, and shall come again into this land. For Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return to him.
\[10]So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun. But they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
\[11]Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
\[12]Also the hand of God came upon Judah to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the rulers by the word of Jehovah.
\[13]And many people assembled at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.
\[14]And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense they took away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.
\[15]Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into the house of Jehovah.
\[16]And they stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from the hand of the Levites.
\[17]For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves. Therefore the Levites had charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to Jehovah.
\[18]For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Jehovah pardon everyone
\[19]who sets his heart to seek God, Jehovah, the God of his fathers, though he be not according to the purification of the sanctuary.
\[20]And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
\[21]And the sons of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness. And the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by day, with loud instruments to Jehovah.
\[22]And Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who had good understanding in the service of Jehovah. So they ate throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
\[23]And the whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days. And they kept those seven days with gladness.
\[24]For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep. And the rulers gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep. And a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
\[25]And all the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners who came out of the land of Israel, and who dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
\[26]So there was great joy in Jerusalem. For since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.
\[27]Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people. And their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven.

ow when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke in pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and broke down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, also in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the sons of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.
\[2]And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites after their divisions, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of Jehovah.
\[3]Also he appointed the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, namely, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of Jehovah.
\[4]Moreover he commanded the people who dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of Jehovah.
\[5]And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the sons of Israel gave in abundance the first-fruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field. And they brought in the tithe of all things abundantly.
\[6]And the sons of Israel and Judah, who dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to Jehovah their God, and laid them by heaps.
\[7]In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
\[8]And when Hezekiah and the rulers came and saw the heaps, they blessed Jehovah, and his people Israel.
\[9]Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
\[10]And Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since they began to bring the oblations into the house of Jehovah, we have eaten and had enough, and have plenty left. For Jehovah has blessed his people, and that which is left is this great store.
\[11]Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Jehovah, and they prepared them.
\[12]And they brought in the oblations and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully. And Conaniah the Levite was ruler over them, and Shimei his brother was second.
\[13]And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.
\[14]And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east gate, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of Jehovah, and the most holy things.
\[15]And under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brothers by divisions, as well to the great as to the small,
\[16]besides those who were reckoned by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even everyone that entered into the house of Jehovah, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their divisions,
\[17]and those who were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers' houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their divisions,
\[18]and those who were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation. For in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness.
\[19]Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were men who were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all who were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites.
\[20]And thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah. And he wrought that which was good and right and faithful before Jehovah his God.
\[21]And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.

fter these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself.
\[2]And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib came, and that he intended to fight against Jerusalem,
\[3]he took counsel with his rulers and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were outside the city. And they helped him.
\[4]So there was gathered together many people. And they stopped all the fountains, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?
\[5]And he took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, and the other wall outside, and strengthened Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.
\[6]And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying,
\[7]Be strong and of good courage, be not afraid nor dismayed of the king of Assyria, nor of all the multitude that is with him. For there is a greater with us than with him.
\[8]With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is Jehovah our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
\[9]After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem (now he was before Lachish, and all his power with him) to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,
\[10]Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, On what do ye trust that ye remain in the siege in Jerusalem?
\[11]Does not Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\[12]Has not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and upon it ye shall burn incense?
\[13]Know ye not what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand?
\[14]Who was there among all the gods of those nations, which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?
\[15]Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe ye him. For no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers. How much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?
\[16]And his servants spoke yet more against Jehovah God, and against his servant Hezekiah.
\[17]He also wrote letters, to rail on Jehovah, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall the God of Hezekiah not deliver his people out of my hand.
\[18]And they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them, and to trouble them, that they might take the city.
\[19]And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men's hands.
\[20]And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried out to heaven.
\[21]And Jehovah sent an agent who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he came into the house of his god, those who came forth from his own bowels killed him there with the sword.
\[22]Thus Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.
\[23]And many brought gifts to Jehovah to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah. So that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.
\[24]In those days Hezekiah was sick even to death, and he prayed to Jehovah. And he spoke to him, and gave him a sign.
\[25]But Hezekiah did not render again according to the benefit done to him. For his heart was lifted up. Therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
\[26]Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Jehovah did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
\[27]And Hezekiah had exceedingly much riches and honor. And he provided for him treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of goodly vessels,
\[28]also store-houses for the increase of grain and new wine and oil, and stalls for all manner of beasts, and flocks in folds.
\[29]Moreover he provided for him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance. For God had given him very much substance.
\[30]This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
\[31]However in the business of the ambassadors of the rulers of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.
\[32]Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\[33]And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the sepulchers of the sons of David. And all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

anasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
\[2]And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the sons of Israel.
\[3]For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down. And he reared up altars for the Baalim, and made Asheroth, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them.
\[4]And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, of which Jehovah said, In Jerusalem shall my name be forever.
\[5]And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.
\[6]He also made his sons to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom. And he practiced augury, and used enchantments, and practiced sorcery, and dealt with psychics, and with wizards. He wrought much evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
\[7]And he set the graven image of the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever,
\[8]neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances given by Moses.
\[9]And Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil more than the nations did whom Jehovah destroyed before the sons of Israel.
\[10]And Jehovah spoke to Manasseh, and to his people, but they gave no heed.
\[11]Therefore Jehovah brought upon them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
\[12]And when he was in distress, he besought Jehovah his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.
\[13]And he prayed to him. And he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah he was God.
\[14]Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate. And he encompassed Ophel around with it, and raised it up to a very great height. And he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.
\[15]And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Jehovah, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.
\[16]And he built up the altar of Jehovah, and offered on it sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve Jehovah, the God of Israel.
\[17]Nevertheless the people still sacrificed in the high places, but only to Jehovah their God.
\[18]Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.
\[19]Also his prayer, and how God was entreated by him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the graven images, before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.
\[20]So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. And Amon his son reigned in his stead.
\[21]Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
\[22]And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father. And Amon sacrificed to all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.
\[23]And he did not humble himself before Jehovah, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself, but this same Amon trespassed more and more.
\[24]And his servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.
\[25]But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon. And the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.

osiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
\[2]And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.
\[3]For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father. And in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images.
\[4]And they broke down the altars of the Baalim in his presence, and the sun-images that were on high above them he hewed down, and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it upon the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
\[5]And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.
\[6]And so also in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even to Naphtali, in their ruins round about.
\[7]And he broke down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the graven images into powder, and hewed down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.
\[8]Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Jehovah his God.
\[9]And they came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered by the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and by all the remnant of Israel, and by all Judah and Benjamin, and by the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[10]And they delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Jehovah. And the workmen who labored in the house of Jehovah gave it to mend and repair the house.
\[11]Even to the carpenters and to the builders they gave it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
\[12]And the men did the work faithfully. And the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward, and others of the Levites, all who were skilful with instruments of music.
\[13]Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set forward all who did the work in every manner of service. And of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.
\[14]And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Jehovah given by Moses.
\[15]And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.
\[16]And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they are doing.
\[17]And they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Jehovah, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.
\[18]And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me. And Shaphan read therein before the king.
\[19]And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he tore his clothes.
\[20]And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying,
\[21]Go ye, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found. For great is the wrath of Jehovah that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah, to do according to all that is written in this book.
\[22]So Hilkiah, and those whom the king had commanded, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter), and they spoke to her to that effect.
\[23]And she said to them, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man who sent you to me,
\[24]Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of it, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.
\[25]Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore my wrath is poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched.
\[26]But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus ye shall say to him, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel: As concerning the words which thou have heard,
\[27]because thy heart was tender, and thou humbled thyself before God when thou heard his words against this place, and against the inhabitants of it, and have humbled thyself before me, and have torn thy clothes, and wept before me, I also have heard thee, says Jehovah.
\[28]Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shall be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of it. And they brought back word to the king.
\[29]Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
\[30]And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small. And he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of Jehovah.
\[31]And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.
\[32]And he caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
\[33]And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the sons of Israel, and made all who were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Jehovah their God. All his days they did not depart from following Jehovah, the God of their fathers.

nd Josiah kept a Passover to Jehovah in Jerusalem. And they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
\[2]And he set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them to the service of the house of Jehovah.
\[3]And he said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to Jehovah, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built. There shall no more be a burden upon your shoulders. Now serve Jehovah your God, and his people Israel.
\[4]And prepare yourselves after your fathers' houses by your divisions, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.
\[5]And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of your brothers the sons of the people, and the portion of a fathers' house of the Levites.
\[6]And kill the Passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to the word of Jehovah by Moses.
\[7]And Josiah gave to the sons of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the Passover offerings, to all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and also three thousand bullocks; these were of the king's substance.
\[8]And his rulers gave for a freewill offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.
\[9]Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.
\[10]So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their divisions, according to the king's commandment.
\[11]And they killed the Passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood by their hand, and the Levites skinned them.
\[12]And they removed the burnt offerings that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of the sons of the people, to offer to Jehovah as it is written in the book of Moses. And so they did with the oxen.
\[13]And they roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance. And the holy offerings they boiled in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the sons of the people.
\[14]And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron were busy in offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night. Therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
\[15]And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer. And the porters were at every gate. They did not need to depart from their service, for their brothers the Levites prepared for them.
\[16]So all the service of Jehovah was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of Jehovah, according to the commandment of king Josiah.
\[17]And the sons of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
\[18]And there was no Passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet. Neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[19]In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.
\[20]After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates, and Josiah went out against him.
\[21]But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house with which I have war, and God has commanded me to make haste. Cease thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he not destroy thee.
\[22]Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself that he might fight with him. And he did not hearken to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
\[23]And the archers shot at king Josiah. And the king said to his servants, Remove me, for I am severely wounded.
\[24]So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died, and was buried in the sepulchers of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
\[25]And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah. And all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day. And they made them an ordinance in Israel, and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.
\[26]Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of Jehovah,
\[27]and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

hen the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.
\[2]Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
\[3]And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and fined the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
\[4]And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
\[5]Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God.
\[6]Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him in fetters to carry him to Babylon.
\[7]Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
\[8]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
\[9]Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.
\[10]And at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the good vessels of the house of Jehovah, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.
\[11]Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
\[12]And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God. He did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of Jehovah.
\[13]And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God. But he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning to Jehovah, the God of Israel.
\[14]Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations. And they polluted the house of Jehovah which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.
\[15]And Jehovah, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending, because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place.
\[16]But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of Jehovah arose against his people, till there was no remedy.
\[17]Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or virgin, old man or hoary-headed. He gave them all into his hand.
\[18]And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king, and of his rulers, all these he brought to Babylon.
\[19]And they burnt the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces of it with fire, and destroyed all the good vessels of it.

\[21]to fulfill the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths; as long as it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.
\[22]Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,
\[23]Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth has Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me. And he has charged me to build a house for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, Jehovah his God be with him, and let him go up.

\[2]Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth has Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me, and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
\[3]Whoever there is among you of all his people, his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of Jehovah, the God of Israel (he is God), which is in Jerusalem.
\[4]And whoever is left, in any place where he sojourns, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the freewill offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.
\[5]Then the heads of fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit God had stirred, rose up to go up to build the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem.
\[6]And all those who were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.
\[7]Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put in the house of his gods,
\[8]even those Cyrus king of Persia brought forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them to Sheshbazzar, the ruler of Judah.
\[9]And this is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, a thousand platters of silver, twenty-nine knives,
\[10]thirty bowls of gold, four hundred and ten silver bowls of a second sort, and a thousand other vessels.
\[11]All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these Sheshbazzar brought up when those of the captivity were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem.

nd when the seventh month came, and the sons of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.
\[2]Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brothers, stood up and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.
\[3]And they set the altar upon its base, for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the countries. And they offered burnt offerings on it to Jehovah, even burnt offerings morning and evening.
\[4]And they kept the feast of tabernacles as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required.
\[5]And afterward the continual burnt offering, and the offerings of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of Jehovah that were consecrated, and of everyone who willingly offered a freewill offering to Jehovah.
\[6]From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to Jehovah. But the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was not yet laid.
\[7]Also they gave money to the masons, and to the carpenters, and food, and drink, and oil, to those of Sidon, and to those of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
\[8]Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all those who came out of the captivity to Jerusalem, began. And they appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the house of Jehovah.
\[9]Then Jeshua with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, stood together to have the oversight of the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brothers the Levites.
\[10]And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise Jehovah, after the order of David king of Israel.
\[11]And they sang one to another in praising and giving thanks to Jehovah, saying, For he is good, for his loving kindness is forever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised Jehovah, because the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid.
\[12]But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers, the old men who had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice, and many shouted aloud for joy.
\[13]So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people, for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.

ow when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the sons of the captivity were building a temple to Jehovah, the God of Israel,
\[2]then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers, and said to them, Let us build with you, for we seek your God, as ye do, and we sacrifice to him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria who brought us up here.
\[3]But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers of Israel, said to them, Ye have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God, but we ourselves together will build to Jehovah, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.
\[4]Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,
\[5]and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
\[6]And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
\[7]And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia. And the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian character, and set forth in the Syrian tongue.
\[8]Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this way.
\[9]Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,
\[10]and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and in the rest beyond the River, and so forth.
\[11]This is a copy of the letter that they sent to Artaxerxes the king: Thy servants the men beyond the River, and so forth.
\[12]Be it known to the king, that the Jews who came up from thee have come to us to Jerusalem. They are building the rebellious and the evil city, and have finished the walls, and repaired the foundations.
\[13]Be it known now to the king, that, if this city be built, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings.
\[14]Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not fitting for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore we have sent and certified to the king,
\[15]that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers. So thou shall find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces. And that they have made sedition within the same of old time, for which cause this city was laid waste.
\[16]We certify to the king that, if this city be built, and the walls finished, by this means thou shall have no portion beyond the River.
\[17]Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions who dwell in Samaria, and in the rest beyond the River: Peace, and so forth.
\[18]The letter which ye sent to us has been plainly read before me.
\[19]And I decreed, and search has been made. And it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it.
\[20]There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem who have ruled over all the country beyond the River, and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid to them.
\[21]Make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this city not be built until a decree shall be made by me.
\[22]And take heed that ye be not slack in this matter. Why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
\[23]Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them cease by force and power.
\[24]Then the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem ceased, and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.

\[3]At the same time Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, came to them, and said thus to them, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?
\[4]Then we told them after this manner, namely, what the names of the men were who were making this building.

\[7]they sent a letter to him, in which was written thus: To Darius the king, all peace.
\[8]Be it known to the king, that we went into the province of Judah to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls. And this work goes on with diligence and prospers in their hands.
\[9]Then we asked those elders, and said to them thus: Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?
\[10]Also, we asked them their names, to certify to thee, that we might write the names of the men who were at the head of them.
\[11]And thus they returned us an answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth. And are building the house that was built these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.
\[12]But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath. He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.
\[13]But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God.
\[14]And also the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon, those Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one whose name was Sheshbazzar whom he had made governor.
\[15]And he said to him, Take these vessels. Go put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place.
\[16]Then the same Sheshbazzar came, and laid the foundations of the house of God which is in Jerusalem. And since that time even until now it has been in building, and yet it is not completed.
\[17]Now therefore, if it seems good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure-house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made from Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.

\[2]And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, a roll, and in it was thus written for a record:
\[3]In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house be built-the place where they offer sacrifices-and let the foundations of it be strongly laid, the height of it sixty cubits, and the breadth of it sixty cubits,
\[4]with three courses of great stones, and a course of new timber. And let the expenses be given out of the king's house.
\[5]And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and brought again to the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to its place. And thou shall put them in the house of God.
\[6]Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the River, be ye far from there:
\[7]Let the work of this house of God alone. Let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place.
\[8]Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: That of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses be given with all diligence to these men, that they not be hindered.
\[9]And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, also wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests who are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail
\[10]that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savor to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.
\[11]Also I have made a decree, that whoever shall alter this word, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon, and let his house be made a dunghill for this.
\[12]And the God who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples who shall put forth their hand to alter the same, to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree, let it be done with all diligence.
\[13]Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, because of what Darius the king had sent, did accordingly with all diligence.
\[14]And the elders of the Jews built and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built and finished it according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
\[15]And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
\[16]And the sons of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the sons of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.
\[17]And they offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs. And for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
\[18]And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their divisions, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.
\[19]And the sons of the captivity kept the Passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month.
\[20]For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together, all of them were pure. And they killed the Passover for all the sons of the captivity, and for their brothers the priests, and for themselves.
\[21]And the sons of Israel who came again out of the captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, ate,
\[22]and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy. For Jehovah had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.

\[13]I make a decree, that all those of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, who are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with thee.
\[14]Forasmuch as thou are sent from the king and his seven counselors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thy hand,
\[15]and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,
\[16]and all the silver and gold that thou shall find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly, for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem.
\[17]Therefore thou shall with all diligence buy with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meal offerings and their drink offerings, and shall offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.
\[18]And whatever shall seem good to thee and to thy brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do ye after the will of your God.
\[19]And the vessels that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.
\[20]And whatever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shall have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure-house.
\[21]And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers who are beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done with all diligence,
\[22]to a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.
\[23]Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
\[24]Also we certify to you, that concerning any of the priests and Levites, the singers, porters, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll, upon them.
\[25]And thou, Ezra, according to the wisdom of thy God, that is in thy hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people who are beyond the River, all such as know the laws of thy God, and teach ye him who does not know them.
\[26]And whoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him with all diligence, whether it be to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
\[27]Blessed be Jehovah, the God of our fathers, who has put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem,
\[28]and has extended loving kindness to me before the king, and his counselors, and before all the king's mighty rulers. And I was strengthened according to the hand of Jehovah my God upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.

\[15]And I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava, and there we encamped three days. And I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.
\[16]Then I sent for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men, also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, who were teachers.
\[17]And I sent them forth to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say to Iddo, and his brothers the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.
\[18]And according to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brothers, eighteen,
\[19]and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty,
\[20]and of the Nethinim, whom David and the rulers had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim. All of them were mentioned by name.
\[21]Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a straight way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
\[22]For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way, because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all those who seek him, for good, but his power and his wrath are against all those who forsake him.
\[23]So we fasted and besought our God for this, and he was entreated by us.
\[24]Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,
\[25]and weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counselors, and his rulers, and all Israel there present, had offered.
\[26]I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and a hundred talents of silver vessels, a hundred talents of gold,
\[27]and twenty bowls of gold, of a thousand darics, and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold.
\[28]And I said to them, Ye are holy to Jehovah, and the vessels are holy, and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to Jehovah, the God of your fathers.
\[29]Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the rulers of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.
\[30]So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.
\[31]Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. And the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the ambushment by the way.
\[32]And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
\[33]And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas, and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levite,
\[34]the whole by number and by weight. And all the weight was written at that time.
\[35]The sons of the captivity, who came out of exile, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to Jehovah.
\[36]And they delivered the king's commissions to the king's satraps, and to the governors beyond the River. And they furthered the people and the house of God.

ow when these things were done, the rulers drew near to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
\[2]For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the peoples of the lands. Yea, the hand of the heads and rulers has been chief in this trespass.
\[3]And when I heard this thing, I tore my garment and my robe, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded.
\[4]Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel were assembled to me, because of the trespass of those of the captivity, and I sat confounded until the evening oblation.
\[5]And at the evening oblation I arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe torn, and I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands to Jehovah my God,
\[6]and I said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God, for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our guiltiness has grown up to the heavens.
\[7]Since the days of our fathers we have been exceedingly guilty to this day. And for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.
\[8]And now for a little moment grace has been shown from Jehovah our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
\[9]For we are bondmen, yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended loving kindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the ruins of it, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
\[10]And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken thy commandments,
\[11]which thou have commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, to which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness.
\[12]Now therefore do not give your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity forever, that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your sons forever.
\[13]And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that thou our God have punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us such a remnant,
\[14]shall we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples who do these abominations? Would thou not be angry with us till thou had consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?
\[15]O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thou are righteous, for we are left a remnant that is escaped, as it is this day. Behold, we are before thee in our guiltiness, for none can stand before thee because of this.

ow while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered together to him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children, for the people wept very much.
\[2]And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land. Yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.
\[3]Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God, and let it be done according to the law.
\[4]Arise, for the matter belongs to thee, and we are with thee. Be of good courage, and do it.
\[5]Then Ezra arose, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they swore.
\[6]Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib. And when he came there, he ate no bread, nor drank water, for he mourned because of the trespass of those of the captivity.
\[7]And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the sons of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem.
\[8]And that whoever did not come within three days, according to the counsel of the rulers and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity.
\[9]Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month, and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.
\[10]And Ezra the priest stood up, and said to them, Ye have trespassed, and have married foreign women to increase the guilt of Israel.
\[11]Now therefore make confession to Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure, and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.
\[12]Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, As thou have said concerning us, so must we do.
\[13]But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand outside. Neither is this a work of one day or two, for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.
\[14]Let now our rulers be appointed for all the assembly, and let all those who are in our cities who have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this matter be dispatched.
\[15]Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this, and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
\[16]And the sons of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain heads of fathers, after their fathers' houses, and all of them by their names, were set apart. And they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
\[17]And they made an end with all the men who had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.
\[18]And among the sons of the priests there were found who had married foreign women, namely, of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brothers, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.
\[19]And they gave their hand that they would put away their wives. And being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt.

he words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,
\[2]that Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men out of Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
\[3]And they said to me, The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach. Also the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and the gates of it are burned with fire.
\[4]And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days. And I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,
\[5]and said, I beseech thee, O Jehovah, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments:
\[6]Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou may hearken to the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the sons of Israel thy servants while I confess the sins of the sons of Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Yea, I and my father's house have sinned.
\[7]We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which thou commanded thy servant Moses.
\[8]Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commanded thy servant Moses, saying, If ye trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples,
\[9]but if ye return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the outermost part of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.
\[10]Now these are thy servants and thy people whom thou have redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.
\[11]O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who delight to fear thy name, and, I pray thee, prosper thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was cupbearer to the king.

nd it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not formerly been sad in his presence.
\[2]And the king said to me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou are not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very much afraid.
\[3]And I said to the king, Let the king live forever. Why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchers, lies waste, and the gates of it are consumed with fire?
\[4]Then the king said to me, For what do thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.
\[5]And I said to the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant has found favor in thy sight, that thou would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' sepulchers, that I may build it.
\[6]And the king said to me (the queen also sitting by him), For how long shall thy journey be? And when will thou return? So it pleased the king to send me, and I set him a time.
\[7]Moreover I said to the king, If it please the king, let letters be given to me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through till I come to Judah,
\[8]and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which appertains to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
\[9]Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.
\[10]And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there came a man to seek the welfare of the sons of Israel.
\[11]So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
\[12]And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me. I neither told any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem, nor was there any beast with me except the beast that I rode upon.
\[13]And I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal's well and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates of it were consumed with fire.
\[14]Then I went on to the fountain gate and to the king's pool, but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.
\[15]Then I went up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall. And I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned.
\[16]And the rulers did not know where I went, or what I did, neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the ranking men, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest who did the work.
\[17]Then I said to them, Ye see the evil condition that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and the gates of it are burned with fire. Come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more a reproach.
\[18]And I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me, as also of the king's words that he had spoken to me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good work.
\[19]But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? Will ye rebel against the king?
\[20]Then I answered them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us. Therefore we his servants will arise and build, but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.

ut it came to pass that, when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.
\[2]And he spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burnt?
\[3]Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox goes up he shall break down their stone wall.
\[4]Hear, O our God, for we are despised, and so turn back their reproach upon their own head, and give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity,
\[5]and do not cover their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee, for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.
\[6]So we built the wall, and all the wall was joined together to half the height of it, for the people had a mind to work.
\[7]But it came to pass that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very angry,
\[8]and all of them together conspired to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein.
\[9]But we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.
\[10]And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens has become feeble, and there is much rubbish, so that we are not able to build the wall.
\[11]And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and kill them, and cause the work to cease.
\[12]And it came to pass that, when the Jews who dwelt by them came, they said to us ten times, From all places from where ye shall return to us they will be upon you.
\[13]Therefore I set in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set there the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
\[14]And I looked, and rose up, and said to the ranking men, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
\[15]And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to naught, that we returned all of us to the wall, every man to his work.
\[16]And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants labored in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail. And the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.
\[17]They all built the wall, and those who bore burdens loaded themselves, every man with one of his hands labored in the work, and with the other held his weapon,
\[18]and the builders, every man had his sword girded by his side, and so built. And he who sounded the trumpet was by me.
\[19]And I said to the ranking men, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.
\[20]In whatever place ye hear the sound of the trumpet, gather ye there to us, our God will fight for us.
\[21]So we labored in the work, and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
\[22]Likewise at the same time I said to the people, Let each with his servant lodge within Jerusalem that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.
\[23]So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us put off our clothes, everyone went with his weapon to the water.

hen there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews.
\[2]For there were who said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many. Let us get grain that we may eat and live.
\[3]There were some also who said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses. Let us get grain because of the dearth.
\[4]There were also who said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute upon our fields and our vineyards.
\[5]Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our sons as their sons. And, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage already. Neither is it in our power to help it, for other men have our fields and our vineyards.
\[6]And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
\[7]Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the ranking men and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact usury, everyone of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.
\[8]And I said to them, According to our ability we have redeemed our brothers the Jews, who were sold to the nations, and would ye even sell your brothers, and should they be sold to us? Then they were silent, and found not a word.
\[9]Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good. Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?
\[10]And I likewise, my brothers and my servants, lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.
\[11]Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.
\[12]Then they said, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them, so will we do, even as thou say. Then I called the priests, and took an oath from them that they would do according to this promise.
\[13]Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, who does not perform this promise, even thus be he shaken out and emptied. And all the assembly said, Truly, and praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise.
\[14]Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor.
\[15]But the former governors who were before me charged the people, and took bread and wine from them, besides forty shekels of silver. Yes, even their servants bore rule over the people. But I did not so, because of the fear of God.
\[16]Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither did we buy any land. And all my servants were gathered there to the work.
\[17]Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those who came to us from among the nations that were round about us.
\[18]Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep, also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine. Yet for all this I did not demand the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.
\[19]Remember to me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.

ow it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and to the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it, (though even to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),
\[2]that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
\[3]And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it, and come down to you?
\[4]And they sent to me four times after this sort, and I answered them after the same manner.
\[5]Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand
\[6]in which was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel, for which cause thou are building the wall. And thou would be their king according to these words.
\[7]And thou have also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah. And now it shall be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.
\[8]Then I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as thou say, but thou imagine them out of thine own heart.
\[9]For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work that it not be done. But now, O God, strengthen thou my hands.
\[10]And I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up, and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple. For they will come to kill thee, yea, they will come to kill thee in the night.
\[11]And I said, Should such a man as I flee? And who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.
\[12]And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him, but he pronounced this prophecy against me, and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
\[13]For this cause he was hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
\[14]Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, who would have put me in fear.
\[15]So the wall was finished in the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.
\[16]And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard of it, that all the nations that were around us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes, for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.
\[17]Moreover in those days the ranking men of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came to them.
\[18]For there were many in Judah sworn to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.
\[19]Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.

ow it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
\[2]that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem, for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.
\[3]And I said to them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot, and while they stand on guard, let them shut the doors, and bar ye them. And appoint watchmen of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, everyone in his watch, and everyone to be opposite his house.
\[4]Now the city was wide and large, but the people in it were few, and the houses were not built.
\[5]And my God put into my heart to gather together the ranking men, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up at the first. And I found written therein:
\[6]These are the sons of the province who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, everyone to his city,
\[7]who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:

\[45]The porters: the sons of Shallum, the sons of Ater, the sons of Talmon, the sons of Akkub, the sons of Hatita, the sons of Shobai, a hundred thirty-eight.

\[58]the sons of Jaala, the sons of Darkon, the sons of Giddel,
\[59]the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the sons of Amon.
\[60]All the Nethinim and the sons of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety-two.
\[61]And these were those who went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not show their fathers' house, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel:
\[62]The sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, six hundred forty-two.
\[63]And of the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.
\[64]These sought their registration among those who were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found. Therefore they were deemed polluted and put from the priesthood.
\[65]And the governor said to them that they should not eat of the most holy things till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim.
\[66]The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty,
\[67]besides their men-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty-seven. And they had two hundred forty-five singing men and singing women.
\[68]Their horses were seven hundred thirty-six, their mules, two hundred forty-five,
\[69]their camels, four hundred thirty-five, their donkeys, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
\[70]And some from among the heads of fathers gave to the work. The governor gave to the treasury a thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests' garments.
\[71]And some of the heads of fathers gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver.
\[72]And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and sixty-seven priests' garments.
\[73]So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinim, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities. And when the seventh month came, the sons of Israel were in their cities.

nd all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was before the water gate. And they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded to Israel.
\[2]And Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all who could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.
\[3]And he read in it before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those who could understand. And the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law.
\[4]And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand, and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
\[5]And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people (for he was above all the people), and when he opened it, all the people stood up.
\[6]And Ezra blessed Jehovah, the great God. And all the people answered, Truly, Truly, with the lifting up of their hands. And they bowed their heads, and worshiped Jehovah with their faces to the ground.
\[7]Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law. And the people stood in their place.
\[8]And they read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly, and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading.
\[9]And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites who taught the people, said to all the people, This day is holy to Jehovah your God; do not mourn nor weep. For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law.
\[10]Then he said to them, Go your way, eat fat things, and drink sweet things, and send portions to him for whom nothing is prepared. For this day is holy to our Lord; neither be ye grieved, for the joy of Jehovah is your strength.
\[11]So the Levites quieted all the people, saying, Be silent, for the day is holy, neither be ye grieved.
\[12]And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.
\[13]And on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words of the law.
\[14]And they found written in the law how that Jehovah had commanded by Moses that the sons of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month,
\[15]and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, and fetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.
\[16]So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, each one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim.
\[17]And all the assembly of those who came again out of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths, for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day the sons of Israel had not done so. And there was very great gladness.
\[18]Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days, and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly according to the ordinance.

ow in the twenty-fourth day of this month the sons of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth upon them.
\[2]And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
\[3]And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of Jehovah their God a fourth part of the day, and another fourth part they confessed, and worshiped Jehovah their God.
\[4]Then Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, stood up upon the stairs of the Levites, and cried with a loud voice to Jehovah their God.
\[5]Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless Jehovah your God from everlasting to everlasting. And blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
\[6]Thou are Jehovah, even thou alone, thou have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are on it, the seas and all that is in them, and thou preserve them all. And the host of heaven worships thee.
\[7]Thou are Jehovah, the God who chose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham,
\[8]and found his heart faithful before thee, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it to his seed, and have performed thy words, for thou are righteous.
\[9]And thou saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red Sea,
\[10]and showed signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land, for thou knew that they dealt proudly against them, and got thee a name, as it is this day.
\[11]And thou divided the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land. And thou cast their pursuers into the depths as a stone into the mighty waters.
\[12]Moreover in a pillar of cloud thou led them by day, and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way in which they should go.
\[13]Thou also came down upon mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,
\[14]and made known to them thy holy sabbath, and commanded them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses thy servant.
\[15]And thou gave them bread from heaven for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commanded them that they should go in to possess the land which thou had sworn to give them.
\[16]But they and our fathers dealt proudly and stiffened their neck, and did not hearken to thy commandments,
\[17]and refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou did among them, but stiffened their neck. And in their rebellion they appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But thou are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and did not forsake them.
\[18]Yea, when they had made a molten calf for them, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations,
\[19]yet thou in thy manifold mercies did not forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud did not depart from over them by day to lead them in the way, neither the pillar of fire by night to show them light, and the way in which they should go.
\[20]Thou also gave thy good Spirit to instruct them, and did not withhold thy manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.
\[21]Yea, forty years thou sustained them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing; their clothes did not grow old, and their feet did not swell.
\[22]Moreover thou gave them kingdoms and peoples, which thou allotted after their portions. So they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.
\[23]Their sons thou also multiplied as the stars of heaven, and brought them into the land concerning which thou said to their fathers that they should go in to possess it.
\[24]So the sons went in and possessed the land. And thou subdued the inhabitants of the land before them, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
\[25]And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.
\[26]Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, and killed thy prophets who testified against them to turn them again to thee, and they wrought great provocations.
\[27]Therefore thou delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them. And in the time of their trouble, when they cried to thee, thou heard from heaven, and according to thy manifold mercies thou gave them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries.
\[28]But after they had rest, they again did evil before thee. Therefore thou left them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them. Yet when they returned, and cried to thee, thou heard from heaven, and many times thou delivered them according to thy mercies,
\[29]and testified against them, that thou might bring them again to thy law. Yet they dealt proudly, and did not hearken to thy commandments, but sinned against thine ordinances (which if a man does, he shall live in them), and withdrew the shoulder, and stiffened their neck, and would not hear.
\[30]Yet many years thou bore with them, and testified against them by thy Spirit through thy prophets. Yet they would not give ear. Therefore thou gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
\[31]Nevertheless in thy manifold mercies thou did not make a full end of them, nor forsake them, for thou are a gracious and merciful God.
\[32]Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness, let not all the travail seem little before thee, that has come upon us, on our kings, on our rulers, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.
\[33]However thou are just in all that has come upon us, for thou have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly,
\[34]neither have our kings, our rulers, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened to thy commandments and thy testimonies with which thou testified against them.
\[35]For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gave them, and in the large and fat land which thou gave before them, neither did they turn from their wicked works.
\[36]Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that thou gave to our fathers to eat the fruit of it and the good of it, behold, we are servants in it.
\[37]And it yields much increase to the kings whom thou have set over us because of our sins. Also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.
\[38]And yet for all this we make a sure covenant, and write it, and our rulers, our Levites, and our priests, seal to it.

\[9]Also Bakbukiah and Unno, their brothers, were opposite them according to their offices.
\[10]And Jeshua begot Joiakim, and Joiakim begot Eliashib, and Eliashib begot Joiada,
\[11]and Joiada begot Jonathan, and Jonathan begot Jaddua.
\[12]And in the days of Joiakim were priests, heads of fathers: of Seraiah, Meraiah, of Jeremiah, Hananiah,
\[13]of Ezra, Meshullam, of Amariah, Jehohanan,
\[14]of Malluchi, Jonathan, of Shebaniah, Joseph,

\[22]As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, there were recorded the heads of fathers, also the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian.
\[23]The sons of Levi, heads of fathers, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
\[24]And the chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers opposite them, to praise and give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, watch next to watch.
\[25]Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the watch at the store-houses of the gates.
\[26]These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest the scribe.
\[27]And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
\[28]And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites,
\[29]also from Beth-gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had built for them villages round about Jerusalem.
\[30]And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
\[31]Then I brought up the rulers of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession, one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate,
\[32]and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the rulers of Judah,
\[33]and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
\[34]Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
\[35]and certain of the priests' sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,
\[36]and his brothers, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe was ahead of them.
\[37]And by the fountain gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water gate eastward.
\[38]And the other company of those who gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, upon the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even to the broad wall,
\[39]and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even to the sheep gate. And they stood still in the gate of the guard.
\[40]So stood the two companies of those who gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me,
\[41]and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets,
\[42]and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.
\[43]And they offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy. And the women also and the children rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
\[44]And on that day men were appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites. For Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites who served.
\[45]And they kept the charge of their God, and the charge of the purification, and also the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.
\[46]For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
\[47]And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters as every day required. And they set apart that which was for the Levites, and the Levites set apart that which was for the sons of Aaron.

n that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people, and in it was found written that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever,
\[2]because they did not meet the sons of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them. However our God turned the curse into a blessing.
\[3]And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
\[4]Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied to Tobiah,
\[5]had prepared for him a great chamber, where formerly they laid the meal offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the heave offerings for the priests.
\[6]But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king. And after certain days I asked leave of the king,
\[7]and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
\[8]And it grieved me greatly. Therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.
\[9]Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers. And there I brought again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal offerings and the frankincense.
\[10]And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them, so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had fled each one to his field.
\[11]Then I contended with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.
\[12]Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries.
\[13]And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah, and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah. For they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute to their brothers.
\[14]Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the observances of it.
\[15]In those days I saw in Judah some men treading wine-presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys therewith, as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day. And I testified against them in the day in which they sold foods.
\[16]There dwelt men of Tyre also in it who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath to the sons of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
\[17]Then I contended with the ranking men of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?
\[18]Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? Yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
\[19]And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath. And I set some of my servants over the gates that there should be no burden brought in on the sabbath day.
\[20]So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.
\[21]Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why do ye lodge outside the wall? If ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth they came no more on the sabbath.
\[22]And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember to me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy loving kindness.
\[23]In those days also I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab.
\[24]And their sons spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.
\[25]And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.
\[26]Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet there was no king like him among many nations, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless foreign women caused even him to sin.
\[27]Shall we then hearken to you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?
\[28]And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. Therefore I chased him from me.
\[29]Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
\[30]Thus I cleansed them from all foreigners, and appointed charges for the priests and for the Levites, each one in his work,
\[31]and for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

ow it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces),
\[2]that in those days, when king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,
\[3]in the third year of his reign, he made a feast to all his rulers and his servants, the power of Persia and Media, the ranking men and rulers of the provinces, being before him
\[4]when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and eighty days.
\[5]And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast to all the people who were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace.
\[6]There were hangings of white cloth, of green, and of blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble. The couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red and white and yellow and black marble.
\[7]And they gave them drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance according to the bounty of the king.
\[8]And the drinking was according to the law, none could compel. For so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.
\[9]Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
\[10]On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains who ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,
\[11]to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown to show the peoples and the rulers her beauty, for she was fair to look on.
\[12]But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by the chamberlains. Therefore the king was very angry, and his fury burned in him.
\[13]Then the king said to the wise men who knew the times (for so was the king's manner toward all who knew law and judgment,
\[14]and next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven rulers of Persia and Media who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom),
\[15]What shall we do to queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done the bidding of king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
\[16]And Memucan answered before the king and the rulers, Vashti the queen has not done wrong only to the king, but also to all the rulers, and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus.
\[17]For this deed of the queen will come abroad to all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes when it shall be reported, King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she did not come.
\[18]And this day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen will say the like to all the king's rulers. So there will arise much contempt and wrath.
\[19]If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus, and let the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she.
\[20]And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.
\[21]And the saying pleased the king and the rulers, and the king did according to the word of Memucan.
\[22]For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the language of his people.

fter these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
\[2]Then the king's servants who ministered to him said, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king.
\[3]And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins to Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, to the custody of Hegai the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women. And let their things for purification be given them,
\[4]and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king, and he did so.
\[5]There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,
\[6]who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
\[7]And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter. For she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful. And when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.
\[8]So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to Shushan the palace to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's house to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
\[9]And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. And he quickly gave her things for purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens who were suitable to be given her out of the king's house. And he removed her and her maidens to the best place of the house of the women.
\[10]Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred, for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known.
\[11]And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.
\[12]Now when the turn of every maiden came to go in to king Ahasuerus, after it had been done to her according to the law for the women twelve months (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, namely, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with the things for the purifying of the women),
\[13]then the maiden came to the king in this way: Whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women to the king's house.
\[14]In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, who kept the concubines. She came in to the king no more unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.
\[15]Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked upon her.
\[16]So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
\[17]And the king loved Esther above all the women. And she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
\[18]Then the king made a great feast to all his rulers and his servants, even Esther's feast, and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts according to the bounty of the king.
\[19]And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate.
\[20]Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people, as Mordecai had charged her. For Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, as when she was brought up with him.
\[21]In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those who kept the threshold, were angry, and sought to lay hands on king Ahasuerus.
\[22]And the thing became known to Mordecai, who showed it to Esther the queen, and Esther told the king of it in Mordecai's name.
\[23]And when inquiry was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree. And it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.

fter these things king Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the rulers that were with him.
\[2]And all the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, bowed down, and did reverence to Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down, nor do him reverence.
\[3]Then the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, said to Mordecai, Why do thou transgress the king's commandment?
\[4]Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he did not hearken to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand, for he had told them that he was a Jew.
\[5]And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down, nor do him reverence, then Haman was full of wrath.
\[6]But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.
\[7]In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.
\[8]And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom, and their laws are diverse from those of every people, nor do they keep the king's laws. Therefore it is not for the king's profit to endure them.
\[9]If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed. And I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who have the charge of the king's business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.
\[10]And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.
\[11]And the king said to Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to thee.
\[12]Then the king's scribes were called in the first month, on the thirteenth day of it. And there was written according to all that Haman commanded to the king's satraps, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the rulers of every people, to every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language, in the name of king Ahasuerus it was written. And it was sealed with the king's ring.
\[13]And letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little sons and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.
\[14]A copy of the writing that the decree should be given out in every province was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.
\[15]The posts went forth in haste by the king's commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Shushan was perplexed.

ow when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry.
\[2]And he came even before the king's gate, for none might enter inside the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.
\[3]And in every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing, and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
\[4]And Esther's maidens and her chamberlains came and told it to her. And the queen was exceedingly grieved. And she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him, but he did not receive it.
\[5]Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's chamberlains whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was.
\[6]So Hathach went forth to Mordecai to the broad place of the city, which was before the king's gate.
\[7]And Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews to destroy them.
\[8]Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to charge her that she should go in to the king to make supplication to him, and to make request before him for her people.
\[9]And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
\[10]Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai saying,
\[11]All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, know, that whoever, whether man or woman, shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live. But I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.
\[12]And they told Esther's words to Mordecai.
\[13]Then Mordecai bade them return answer to Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shall escape in the king's house more than all the Jews.
\[14]For if thou altogether keep quiet at this time, then relief and deliverance will arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father's house will perish. And who knows whether thou have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?
\[15]Then Esther bade them return answer to Mordecai,
\[16]Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I also and my maidens will fast in like manner. And so I will go in to the king, which is not according to the law. And if I perish, I perish.

ow it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, opposite the king's house. And the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, opposite the entrance of the house.
\[2]And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the scepter.
\[3]Then the king said to her, What will thou, queen Esther? And what is thy request? It shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom.
\[4]And Esther said, If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.
\[5]Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste that it may be done as Esther has said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
\[6]And the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? And it shall be granted thee. And what is thy request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
\[7]Then Esther answered, and said, My petition and my request is,
\[8]if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.
\[9]Then Haman went forth that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he did not stand up nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.
\[10]Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home, and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife.
\[11]And Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his sons, and all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the rulers and servants of the king.
\[12]Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself, and tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king.
\[13]Yet all this avails me nothing so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.
\[14]Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou to the king that Mordecai may be hanged on it. Then go thou in merrily with the king to the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman, and he caused the gallows to be made.

\[2]And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, of those who kept the threshold, who had sought to lay hands on king Ahasuerus.
\[3]And the king said, What honor and dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this? Then the king's servants who ministered to him said, There is nothing done for him.
\[4]And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman came into the outward court of the king's house to speak to the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
\[5]And the king's servants said to him, Behold, Haman stands in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.
\[6]So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?
\[7]And Haman said to the king, For the man whom the king delights to honor,
\[8]let royal apparel be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides upon, and on the head of which a royal crown is set.
\[9]And let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble rulers, that they may array the man therewith whom the king delights to honor, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.
\[10]Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou have said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate. Let nothing fail of all that thou have spoken.
\[11]Then Haman took the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.
\[12]And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hastened to his house, mourning and having his head covered.
\[13]And Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, If Mordecai, before whom thou have begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shall not prevail against him, but shall surely fall before him.

\[2]And the king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? And it shall be granted thee. And what is thy request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
\[3]Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.
\[4]For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I would have held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king's damage.
\[5]Then king Ahasuerus spoke and said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, who dares presume in his heart to do so?
\[6]And Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.
\[7]And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden. And Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen, for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.
\[8]Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine, and Haman was fallen upon the couch on which Esther was. Then the king said, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.
\[9]Then Harbonah, one of the chamberlains who were before the king said, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, stands in the house of Haman. And the king said, Hang him on it.
\[10]So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king's wrath was pacified.

\[2]And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
\[3]And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.
\[4]Then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter. So Esther arose, and stood before the king.
\[5]And she said, If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews that are in all the king's provinces.
\[6]For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come to my people? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
\[7]Then the king Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.
\[8]Write ye also to the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring, for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.
\[9]Then the king's scribes were called at that time, in the third month Sivan, on the twenty-third day of it. And it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and rulers of the provinces which are from India to Ethiopia, a hundred twenty-seven provinces, to every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.
\[10]And he wrote the name of king Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by post on horseback, riding on swift steeds that were used in the king's service bred of the stud,
\[11]in which the king granted the Jews that were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province who would assault them, their little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,
\[12]upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.
\[13]A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
\[14]So the posts that rode upon swift steeds that were used in the king's service went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace.
\[15]And Mordecai went forth from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple. And the city of Shushan shouted and was glad.
\[16]The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honor.
\[17]And in every province, and in every city, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness and joy, a feast and a good day. And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews, for the fear of the Jews was fallen upon them.

ow in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have rule over them (whereas it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over those who hated them),
\[2]the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt. And no man could withstand them, for the fear of them fell upon all the peoples.
\[3]And all the rulers of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and those who did the king's business, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.
\[4]For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went forth throughout all the provinces, for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater.
\[5]And the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they would to those who hated them.
\[6]And in Shushan the palace the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.
\[7]And they killed Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,
\[8]and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
\[9]and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vaizatha,
\[10]the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jew's enemy, but they did not lay their hand on the spoil.
\[11]On that day the number of those who were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.
\[12]And the king said to Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is thy petition? And it shall be granted thee, or what is thy request further? And it shall be done.
\[13]Then Esther said, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.
\[14]And the king commanded it so to be done. And a decree was given out in Shushan, and they hanged Haman's ten sons.
\[15]And the Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and killed three hundred men in Shushan, but they did not lay their hand on the spoil.
\[16]And the other Jews who were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them. But they did not lay their hand on the spoil.
\[17]This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar. And on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
\[18]But the Jews who were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day of it, and on the fourteenth of it, and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
\[19]Therefore the Jews of the villages, who dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.
\[20]And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both near and far,
\[21]to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,
\[22]as the days in which the Jews had rest from their enemies. And the month which was turned to them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day, that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.
\[23]And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written to them,
\[24]because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them.
\[25]But when the matter came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
\[26]Therefore they called these days Purim, after the name of Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come to them,
\[27]the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves to them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to the writing of it, and according to the appointed time of it, every year.
\[28]And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city, and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the remembrance of them perish from their seed.
\[29]Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.
\[30]And he sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,
\[31]to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had ordained for themselves and for their seed in the matter of the fastings and their cry.
\[32]And the commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim, and it was written in the book.

here was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was perfect and upright, and one who feared God, and turned away from evil.
\[2]And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
\[3]His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-donkeys, and a very great household, so that this man was the greatest of all the sons of the east.
\[4]And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one upon his day, and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
\[5]And it was so, when the days of their feasting were completed, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts. Thus Job did continually.
\[6]Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan also came among them.
\[7]And Jehovah said to Satan, From where do thou come? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.
\[8]And Jehovah said to Satan, Have thou considered my servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.
\[9]Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?
\[10]Have thou not made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has, on every side? Thou have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
\[11]But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce thee to thy face.
\[12]And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in thy power, only upon himself do not put forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.
\[13]And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,
\[14]that there came a messenger to Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,
\[15]and the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away. Yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword, and only I alone have escaped to tell thee.
\[16]While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God fell from heaven, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and only I alone have escaped to tell thee.
\[17]While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword, and only I alone have escaped to tell thee.
\[18]While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house.
\[19]And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead, and only I alone have escaped to tell thee.
\[20]Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshiped.
\[21]And he said, Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked I shall return there. Jehovah gave, and Jehovah has taken away, blessed be the name of Jehovah.

\[3]And Jehovah said to Satan, Have thou considered my servant Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. And he still holds fast his integrity, although thou moved me against him, to destroy him without cause.
\[4]And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man has he will give for his life.
\[5]But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face.
\[6]And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand, only spare his life.
\[7]So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job with severe boils from the sole of his foot to his crown.
\[8]And he took a potsherd for him to scrape himself with it, and he sat among the ashes.
\[9]Then his wife said to him, Do thou still hold fast thine integrity? Renounce God, and die.
\[10]But he said to her, Thou speak as one of the foolish women speaks. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.
\[11]Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that came upon him, they came each one from his own place-Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite-and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.
\[12]And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and did not recognize him, they lifted up their voice, and wept. And each one tore his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
\[13]So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights. And none spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.

\[4]Let that day be darkness. Let not God from above seek for it, nor let the light shine upon it.
\[5]Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own. Let a cloud dwell upon it. Let blackness come upon it.
\[6]As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. Let it not come into the number of the months.
\[7]Lo, let that night be barren. Let no joyful voice come in it.
\[8]Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan.
\[9]Let the stars of the twilight of it be dark. Let it look for light, but have none, nor let it behold the eyelids of the morning.
\[10]Because it did not shut up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.
\[11]Why did I not die from the womb? Why did I not give up the spirit when my mother bore me?
\[12]Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should suck?
\[13]For now I should have lain down and been quiet. I should have slept. Then I would have been at rest
\[14]with kings and counselors of the earth, who built waste places for themselves,
\[15]or with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
\[16]Or I should have been as a hidden untimely birth, as infants that never saw light.
\[17]There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest.
\[18]There the prisoners are at ease together. They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.
\[19]The small and the great are there. And the servant is free from his master.
\[20]Why is light given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,
\[21]who long for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hid treasures,
\[22]who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad when they can find the grave?
\[23]Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God has hedged in?
\[24]For my sighing comes before I eat, and my groanings are poured out like water.
\[25]For the thing which I fear comes upon me, and that which I am afraid of comes to me.

\[4]His sons are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate. Neither is there any to deliver them,
\[5]whose harvest the hungry eat up, and takes it even out of the thorns, and the snare gapes for their substance.
\[6]For affliction does not come forth from the dust, nor does trouble spring out of the ground,

\[8]But as for me, I would seek to God. And to God I would commit my cause,

\[10]who gives rain upon the earth, and sends waters upon the fields,

\[13]He takes the wise in their own craftiness, and the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.
\[14]They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope at noonday as in the night.
\[15]But he saves from the sword of their mouth, even the needy from the hand of the mighty.
\[16]So a poor man has hope, and iniquity stops her mouth.
\[17]Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects. Therefore do not despise thou the chastening of the Almighty.
\[18]For he injures, and binds up. He wounds, and his hands make whole.
\[19]He will deliver thee in six troubles. Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
\[20]In famine he will redeem thee from death, and in war from the power of the sword.
\[21]Thou shall be hid from the scourge of the tongue. Neither shall thou be afraid of destruction when it comes.
\[22]At destruction and dearth thou shall laugh, nor shall thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
\[23]For thou shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
\[24]And thou shall know that thy tent is in peace, and thou shall visit thy fold, and shall miss nothing.
\[25]Thou shall know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.

\[16]which are black because of the ice, in which the snow hides itself.
\[17]What time they grow warm, they vanish. When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
\[18]The caravans that travel by the way of them turn aside. They go up into the waste, and perish.

\[22]Did I say, Give to me? Or, Offer a present for me from your substance?
\[23]Or, Deliver me from the adversary's hand? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?
\[24]Teach me, and I will be quiet. And cause me to understand how I have erred.
\[25]How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what does it reprove?
\[26]Do ye think to reprove words, seeing that the speeches of a man who is desperate are as wind?
\[27]Yea, ye would cast lots upon the fatherless, and make merchandise of your friend.
\[28]Now therefore be pleased to look upon me, for truly I shall not lie to your face.

\[19]How long will thou not look away from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
\[20]If I have sinned, what do I do to thee, O thou watcher of men? Why have thou set me as a mark for thee, so that I am a burden to myself?

\[18]If he is destroyed from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.
\[19]Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth others shall spring.
\[20]Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, nor will he uphold the evildoers.

\[20]Though I be righteous, my own mouth shall condemn me. Though I be perfect, it shall prove me perverse.
\[21]Though I were perfect, I do not regard myself. I despise my life.
\[22]It is all one thing. Therefore I say, He destroys the perfect and the wicked.
\[23]If the scourge kills suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.

\[25]Now my days are swifter than a runner. They flee away. They see no good,
\[26]They are passed away as the swift ships, as the eagle that swoops on the prey.
\[27]If I say, I will forget my complaint. I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer,

\[29]I shall be condemned. Why then do I labor in vain?
\[30]If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands ever so clean,

\[3]These ten times ye have reproached me. Ye are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me.
\[4]And be it indeed that I have erred, my error remains with myself.
\[5]If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach,
\[6]know now that God has subverted me, and has encompassed me with his net.
\[7]Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard. I cry for help, but there is no justice.
\[8]He has walled up my way that I cannot pass, and has set darkness in my paths.
\[9]He has stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.
\[10]He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone. And he has plucked up my hope like a tree.
\[11]He has also kindled his wrath against me. And he considers me to him as his adversaries.
\[12]His troops come on together, and cast up their way against me, and encamp round about my tent.
\[13]He has put my brothers far from me, and my acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.
\[14]My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
\[15]Those who dwell in my house, and my maids, reckon me for a stranger; I am an alien in their sight.
\[16]I call to my servant, and he gives me no answer. I entreat him with my mouth.
\[17]My breath is strange to my wife, and my supplication to the sons of my own mother.
\[18]Even young children despise me. If I arise, they speak against me.
\[19]All my familiar friends abhor me, and those whom I loved are turned against me.
\[20]My bone cleaves to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped with the skin of my teeth.
\[21]Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends, for the hand of God has touched me.
\[22]Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?
\[23]O that my words were now written! O that they were inscribed in a book,
\[24]that they were engraved in the rock forever with an iron pen and lead!
\[25]But as for me I know that my Redeemer lives, and at last he will stand up upon the earth.
\[26]And after my skin, this body, is destroyed, then outside my flesh I shall see God,
\[27]whom I, even I, shall see on my side, and my eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger. My heart is consumed within me.
\[28]If ye say, How we will persecute him! And that the root of the matter is found in me,

\[2]Therefore my thoughts cause me to answer, even because of my haste that is in me.
\[3]I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame, and the spirit of my understanding answers me.
\[4]Know thou this of old time, since man was placed upon earth,
\[5]that the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the profane but for a moment?
\[6]Though his height mounts up to the heavens, and his head reaches to the clouds,
\[7]yet he shall perish forever like his own dung. Those who have seen him shall say, Where is he?
\[8]He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found. Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.

\[10]His sons shall seek the favor of the poor, and his hands shall give back his wealth.
\[11]His bones are full of his youth, but it shall lie down with him in the dust.
\[12]Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue,
\[13]though he spares it, and will not let it go, but keep it still within his mouth,
\[14]yet his food in his bowels is turned. It is the gall of asps within him.
\[15]He has swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again. God will cast them out of his belly.
\[16]He shall suck the poison of asps. The viper's tongue shall kill him.
\[17]He shall not look upon the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and butter.
\[18]That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down. According to the substance that he has gotten, he shall not rejoice.
\[19]For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor. He has violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.
\[20]Because he knew no quietness within him, he shall not save any of that in which he delights.
\[21]There was nothing left that he did not devour, therefore his prosperity shall not endure.
\[22]In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits. The hand of everyone who is in misery shall come upon him.
\[23]When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him, and will rain it upon him while he is eating.
\[24]He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of brass shall strike him through.
\[25]He draws it forth, and it comes out of his body, yea, the glittering point comes out of his gall. Terrors are upon him.
\[26]All darkness is laid up for his treasures. A fire not blown shall devour him. It shall consume that which is left in his tent.
\[27]The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him.
\[28]The increase of his house shall depart, flowed away in the day of his wrath.

\[20]Let his own eyes see his destruction, and let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
\[21]For what does he care for his house after him when the number of his months is cut off?
\[22]Shall any teach God knowledge, seeing he judges those who are high?
\[23]One man dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
\[24]His pails are full of milk, and the marrow of his bones is moistened.
\[25]And another man dies in bitterness of soul, and never tastes of good.
\[26]They lie down alike in the dust, and the worm covers them.

\[29]Have ye not asked wayfaring men? And do ye not know their evidences,
\[30]that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity? That they are led forth to the day of wrath?

\[32]Yet he shall be borne to the grave, and men shall keep watch over the tomb.
\[33]The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him. And all men shall draw after him, as there were innumerable before him.

\[3]Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that thou are righteous? Or is it gain to him that thou make thy ways perfect?
\[4]Is it for thy fear of him that he reproves thee, that he enters with thee into judgment?
\[5]Is not thy wickedness great? Neither is there any end to thine iniquities.
\[6]For thou have taken pledges from thy brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing.
\[7]Thou have not given water to the weary to drink, and thou have withheld bread from the hungry.
\[8]But as for the mighty man, he had the land. And the honorable man, he dwelt in it.
\[9]Thou have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
\[10]Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubles thee,
\[11]or darkness, so that thou cannot see, and abundance of waters cover thee.
\[12]Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
\[13]And thou say, What does God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?
\[14]Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he does not see, and he walks on the vault of heaven.
\[15]Will thou keep the old way which wicked men have trodden?
\[16]Who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation was poured out as a stream,
\[17]who said to God, Depart from us, and, What can the Almighty do for us?
\[18]Yet he filled their houses with good things. But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
\[19]The righteous see it, and are glad. And the innocent laugh them to scorn,
\[20]Saying, Surely those who rose up against us are cut off, and the remnant of them, the fire has consumed.
\[21]Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace. By this good shall come to thee.
\[22]Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thy heart.
\[23]If thou return to the Almighty, thou shall be built up, thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents.

\[4]They turn the needy out of the way. The poor of the earth all hide themselves.
\[5]Behold, as wild donkeys in the desert, they go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food. The wilderness yields them bread for their sons.
\[6]They cut their provender in the field, and they glean the vintage of the wicked.
\[7]They lie all night naked without clothing, and have no covering in the cold.
\[8]They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
\[9]There are men who pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor,

\[11]For that is a heinous crime, yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.
\[12]For it is a fire that consumes to destruction, and would root out all my increase.
\[13]If I have despised the case of my man-servant or of my maid-servant when they contended with me,
\[14]what then shall I do when God rises up? And when he visits, what shall I answer him?
\[15]Did not he who made me in the womb make him? And did not one fashion us in the womb?
\[16]If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
\[17]or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not eaten of it
\[18](no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, and her I have guided from my mother's womb);
\[19]if I have seen any perish for lack of clothing, or that the needy had no covering;
\[20]if his loins have not blessed me, and if he has not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
\[21]if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate,
\[22]then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade, and my arm be broken from the bone.
\[23]For calamity from God is a terror to me, and I can do nothing because of his majesty.
\[24]If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold, Thou are my confidence;
\[25]if I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gotten much;
\[26]if I have beheld the sun when it shone, or the moon walking in brightness,
\[27]and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth has kissed my hand
\[28](this also is an iniquity to be punished by the judges, for I would have denied the God that is above);
\[29]if I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him
\[30](yea, I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse);
\[31]if the men of my tent have not said, Who can find one who has not been filled with his food?
\[32](the sojourner has not lodged in the street, but I have opened my doors to the traveler);
\[33]if like Adam I have covered my transgressions by hiding my iniquity in my bosom
\[34]because I feared the great multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me so that I kept silence, and did not go out of the door-
\[35]O that I had someone to hear me (Lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me), and that I had the indictment which my adversary has written!
\[36]Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder. I would bind it to me as a crown.
\[37]I would declare to him the number of my steps. I would go near to him as a prince.
\[38]If my land cries out against me, and the furrows of it weep together;
\[39]if I have eaten the fruits of it without money, or have caused the owners of it to lose their lives,
\[40]let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.

o these three men ceased to answer Job because he was righteous in his own eyes.
\[2]Then the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled. His anger was kindled against Job because he justified himself rather than God.
\[3]His anger was also kindled against his three friends because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
\[4]Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were older than he.
\[5]And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his anger was kindled.
\[6]And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old. Therefore I held back, and dared not show you my opinion.
\[7]I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
\[8]But there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.
\[9]It is not the great who are wise, nor the aged who understand justice.
\[10]Therefore I said, Hearken to me, I also will show my opinion.
\[11]Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your reasonings, while ye searched out what to say.
\[12]Yea, I attended to you. And, behold, there was none who convinced Job, or who answered his words among you.
\[13]Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom. God may vanquish him, not man.
\[14]For he has not directed his words against me. Neither will I answer him with your speeches.
\[15]They are amazed, they answer no more. They have not a word to say.
\[16]And shall I wait because they do not speak, because they stand still, and answer no more?
\[17]I also will answer my part. I also will show my opinion,
\[18]for I am full of words. The spirit within me compels me.
\[19]Behold, my breast is as wine which has no vent. Like new wine-skins it is ready to burst.
\[20]I will speak that I may be refreshed. I will open my lips and answer.
\[21]Let me not, I pray you, respect any man's person. Neither will I give flattering titles to any man.

\[3]My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart, and that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.
\[4]The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
\[5]If thou can, answer thou me. Set thy words in order before me. Stand forth.

\[9]I am clean, without transgression. I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me.
\[10]Thou say, Behold, he finds occasions against me. He counts me for his enemy.
\[11]He puts my feet in the stocks. He marks all my paths.
\[12]Behold, I will answer thee. In this thou are not just, for God is greater than man.
\[13]Why do thou strive against him because he does not give account of any of his matters?
\[14]For God speaks once, yea twice, though man does not regard it.
\[15]In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men, in slumberings upon the bed.
\[16]Then he opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction
\[17]that he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
\[18]He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
\[19]He also is chastened with pain upon his bed, and with continual strife in his bones,
\[20]so that his life abhors bread, and his soul dainty food.
\[21]His flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seen. And his bones that were not seen stick out.
\[22]Yea, his soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the destroyers.
\[23]If there be with him an agent, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man what is right for him,
\[24]then God is gracious to him, and says, Deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom.
\[25]His flesh shall be fresher than a child's. He returns to the days of his youth.
\[26]He prays to God, and he is favorable to him, so that he sees his face with joy, and he restores to man his righteousness.
\[27]He sings before men, and says, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it did not profit me.
\[28]He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit, and my life shall behold the light.
\[29]Lo, all these things God works twice, yea thrice, with a man,
\[30]to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.
\[31]Mark well, O Job, hearken to me. Keep silent, and I will speak.
\[32]If thou have anything to say, answer me. Speak, for I desire to justify thee.
\[33]If not, hearken thou to me. Keep silent, and I will teach thee.

\[3]For the ear tries words as the palate tastes food.
\[4]Let us choose for us that which is right. Let us know among ourselves what is good.
\[5]For Job has said, I am righteous, and God has taken away my right.
\[6]Notwithstanding my right I am accounted a liar. My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.
\[7]What man is like Job, who drinks up scorning like water,
\[8]saying, I have not sinned, nor committed unrighteousness, nor had fellowship with workers of iniquity to go with the profane.
\[9]For thou should not say, There shall be no visitation to a man, whereas visitation is to him from the Lord.
\[10]Therefore hearken to me, ye men of understanding. Far be it from me to sin before the Lord, and pervert righteousness before the Almighty.
\[11]For the work of a man he will render to him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.
\[12]Yea, certainly God will not do wrong. Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.
\[13]Who gave him a charge over the earth? Or who has disposed the whole world?
\[14]If he sets his heart upon himself, if he gathers his spirit and his breath to himself,
\[15]all flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again to dust.
\[16]If now thou be understanding, hear this. Hearken to the voice of words.
\[17]Behold thou him who hates lawlessness, and who destroys evil men, who is forever righteousness,
\[18]him who says to a king, Thou are vile, to ranking men, Ye are wicked,
\[19]who does not respect the persons of rulers, nor regards the rich more than the poor. For they all are the work of his hands.
\[20]In a moment they die, even at midnight. The people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away without hand.
\[21]For his eyes are upon the ways of a man, and he sees all his goings.
\[22]There is no darkness, nor thick gloom where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
\[23]For he needs no further to consider a man, that he should go before God in judgment.
\[24]He breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out, and sets others in their stead.
\[25]Therefore he takes knowledge of their works, and he overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
\[26]He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others
\[27]because they turned aside from following him, and would not have regard in any of his ways,
\[28]so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heard the cry of the afflicted.
\[29]When he gives quietness, who then can condemn? And when he hides his face, who then can behold him? It is the same whether to a nation, or to a man,
\[30]that the profane man not reign, that there be none to ensnare the people.
\[31]For has any said to God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more.
\[32]Teach thou me that which I do not see. If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?
\[33]Shall his recompense be as thou desire, that thou refuse it? For thou must choose, and not I. Therefore speak what thou know.
\[34]Men of understanding will say to me, yes, every wise man who hears me,
\[35]Job speaks without knowledge, and his words are without wisdom.
\[36]But surely not. Learn thou Job not to still give an answer like the foolish,

\[20]Out of his nostrils a smoke goes, as of a boiling pot and burning rushes.
\[21]His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes forth from his mouth.
\[22]In his neck abides strength, and terror dances before him.

\[26]If a man lays at him with the sword it cannot avail, nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.

\[31]He makes the deep to boil like a pot. He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.

hen Job answered Jehovah, and said,
\[2]I know that thou can do all things, and that no purpose of thine can be restrained.
\[3]Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have uttered that which I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.
\[4]Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak, I will ask of thee, and declare thou to me.
\[5]I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees thee.
\[6]Therefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.
\[7]And it was so, that, after Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends. For ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.
\[8]Now therefore, take to you seven bullocks and seven rams. And go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering. And my servant Job shall pray for you, for him I will accept, that I not deal with you after your folly. For ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.
\[9]So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did according as Jehovah commanded them, and Jehovah accepted Job.
\[10]And Jehovah turned back the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends. And Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before.
\[11]Then there came to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house. And they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him. Each man also gave him a piece of money, and each one a ring of gold.
\[12]So Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-donkeys.
\[13]He had also seven sons and three daughters.
\[14]And he called the name of the first, Jemimah, and the name of the second, Keziah, and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.
\[15]And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job. And their father gave them inheritance among their brothers.
\[16]And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
\[17]So Job died, being old and full of days.

\[33]Jehovah will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.
\[34]Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way, and he will exalt thee to inherit the land. When sinners are cut off, thou shall see it.
\[35]I have seen a wicked man in great power, and spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.

\[39]But the salvation of the righteous is of Jehovah. He is their stronghold in the time of trouble,

\[15]Thou split fountain and flood. Thou dried up mighty rivers.

\[17]Thou have set all the borders of the earth. Thou have made summer and winter.

\[20]Have respect to the covenant, for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.

\[2]I will open my mouth in parables. I will utter dark sayings of old,
\[3]which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
\[4]We will not hide them from their sons, telling to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, and his strength, and his wondrous works that he has done.
\[5]For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their sons,
\[6]that the generation to come might know, even the sons who should be born, who should arise and tell to their sons,
\[7]that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments,
\[8]and might not be as their fathers: a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
\[9]The sons of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
\[10]They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law.
\[11]And they forgot his doings, and his wondrous works that he had shown them.
\[12]He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
\[13]He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through. And he made the waters to stand as a heap.
\[14]In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
\[15]He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.
\[16]He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
\[17]Yet they went on to still sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.
\[18]And they challenged God in their heart by asking food according to their desire.
\[19]Yea, they spoke against God. They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
\[20]Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?
\[21]Therefore Jehovah heard, and was angry. And a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against Israel,
\[22]because they did not believe in God, and did not trust in his salvation.
\[23]Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven,
\[24]and he rained down manna upon them to eat, and gave them food from heaven.
\[25]Man ate the bread of the mighty. He sent them food to the full.
\[26]He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he guided the south wind.
\[27]He also rained flesh upon them as the dust, and winged birds as the sand of the seas.
\[28]And he let it fall in the midst of their camp round about their habitations.
\[29]So they ate, and were well filled, and he gave them their own desire.
\[30]They were not estranged from that which they desired. Their food was yet in their mouths
\[31]when the anger of God went up against them, and killed of the fattest of them, and smote down the young men of Israel.
\[32]For all this they still sinned, and did not believe in his wondrous works.
\[33]Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.
\[34]When he killed them, then they inquired after him, and they returned and sought God earnestly.
\[35]And they remembered that God was their rock, and the Most High God their redeemer.
\[36]But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.
\[37]For their heart was not right with him, nor were they faithful in his covenant.
\[38]But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and destroyed not. Yea, many a time he turned his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
\[39]And he remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and comes not again.
\[40]How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert!
\[41]And they turned again and challenged God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
\[42]They did not remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary,
\[43]how he set his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan,
\[44]and turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.
\[45]He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.
\[46]He also gave their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.
\[47]He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.
\[48]He also gave over their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
\[49]He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, a band of agents of evil.
\[50]He made a path for his anger. He spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,
\[51]and smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.
\[52]But he led forth his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
\[53]And he led them safely, so that they feared not, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
\[54]And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.
\[55]He also drove out the nations before them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
\[56]Yet they challenged and rebelled against the Most High God, and kept not his testimonies,
\[57]but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
\[58]For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
\[59]When God heard, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel,
\[60]so that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men,
\[61]and delivered their strength into captivity, and their glory into the adversary's hand.
\[62]He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance.
\[63]Fire devoured their young men, and their virgins had no marriage-song.
\[64]Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.
\[65]Then the Lord awoke as out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts because of wine.
\[66]And he smote his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach.
\[67]Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim,
\[68]but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
\[69]And he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever.
\[70]He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds.
\[71]He brought him from following the ewes that have their young, to be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
\[72]So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

less Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, thou are very great. Thou are clothed with honor and majesty,
\[2]who covers thyself with light as with a garment, who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,
\[3]who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters, who makes the clouds his chariot, who walks upon the wings of the wind,
\[4]who makes his agents spirits, his ministers a flame of fire,
\[5]who laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be moved forever.
\[6]Thou covered it with the deep as with a vesture. The waters stood above the mountains.
\[7]At thy rebuke they fled. At the voice of thy thunder they hastened away.
\[8]The mountains rose, the valleys sank down to the place which thou had founded for them.
\[9]Thou have set a bound that they may not pass over, that they turn not again to cover the earth.
\[10]He sends forth springs into the valleys. They run among the mountains.
\[11]They give drink to every beast of the field. The wild donkeys quench their thirst.
\[12]By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation. They sing among the branches.
\[13]He waters the mountains from his chambers. The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
\[14]He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and herbage for the service of man, that he may bring forth food out of the earth,
\[15]and wine that makes glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread that strengthens man's heart.
\[16]The trees of Jehovah are full, the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted,
\[17]where the birds make their nests. As for the stork, the fir trees are her house.
\[18]The high mountains are for the wild goats. The rocks are a refuge for the conies.
\[19]He appointed the moon for seasons. The sun knows his going down.
\[20]Thou make darkness, and it is night, during which all the beasts of the forest creep forth.
\[21]The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God.
\[22]The sun arises; they get away, and lie down in their dens.
\[23]Man goes forth to his work and to his labor until the evening.
\[24]O Jehovah, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom have thou made them all. The earth is full of thy riches.
\[25]Yonder is the sea, great and wide, in which are innumerable creeping things, both small and great beasts.
\[26]There go the ships. There is leviathan, whom thou have formed to play in it.
\[27]These all wait for thee, that thou may give them their food in due season.
\[28]Thou give to them, they gather. Thou open thy hand, they are satisfied with good.
\[29]Thou hide thy face, they are troubled. Thou take away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
\[30]Thou send forth thy Spirit, they are created, and thou renew the face of the ground.
\[31]Let the glory of Jehovah endure forever. Let Jehovah rejoice in his works,
\[32]who looks on the earth, and it trembles. He touches the mountains, and they smoke.
\[33]I will sing to Jehovah as long as I live. I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.
\[34]Let thy meditation be sweet to him. I will rejoice in Jehovah.
\[35]Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless Jehovah, O my soul. Praise ye Jehovah.

\[7]He is Jehovah our God. His judgments are in all the earth.
\[8]He has remembered his covenant forever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,

\[10]and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant,
\[11]saying, To thee I will give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance,
\[12]when they were but a few men in number, yea, very few, and sojourners in it.
\[13]And they went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people.
\[14]He allowed no man to do them wrong. Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
\[15]saying, Touch not my anointed men, and do my prophets no harm.
\[16]And he called for a famine upon the land. He broke the whole staff of bread.
\[17]He sent a man before them. Joseph was sold for a servant.
\[18]They hurt his feet with fetters. He was placed in iron.
\[19]Until the time that his word came to pass, the word of Jehovah tried him.
\[20]The king sent and released him, even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.
\[21]He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance,
\[22]to bind his rulers at his pleasure, and teach his elders wisdom.
\[23]Israel also came into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
\[24]And he increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their adversaries.
\[25]He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants.
\[26]He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen.
\[27]They set among them his signs and wonders in the land of Ham.
\[28]He sent darkness, and made it dark. And they rebelled against his words.
\[29]He turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish.
\[30]Their land swarmed with frogs in the chambers of their kings.
\[31]He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and lice in all their borders.
\[32]He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.
\[33]He also smote their vines and their fig trees, and broke the trees of their borders.
\[34]He spoke, and the locust came, and the grasshopper, and that without number,
\[35]and ate up every herb in their land, and ate up the fruit of their ground.
\[36]He also smote all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.
\[37]And he brought them forth with silver and gold, and there was not a feeble soul among his tribes.
\[38]Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them had fallen upon them.
\[39]He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light in the night.
\[40]They asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
\[41]He opened the rock, and waters gushed out. They ran in the dry places like a river.
\[42]For he remembered his holy word, and Abraham his servant.
\[43]And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with singing.
\[44]And he gave them the lands of the nations, and they took the labor of the peoples in possession,
\[45]that they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws. Praise ye Jehovah.

\[2]Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, or show forth all his praise?
\[3]Blessed are those who keep justice, and he who does righteousness at all times.
\[4]Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bear to thy people. O visit me with thy salvation,
\[5]that I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.
\[6]We have sinned with our fathers. We have committed iniquity. we have done wickedly.
\[7]Our fathers did not understand thy wonders in Egypt. They did not remember the multitude of thy loving kindnesses, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
\[8]Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
\[9]He also rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up. So he led them through the depths as through a wilderness.
\[10]And he saved them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
\[11]And the waters covered their adversaries; there was not one of them left.
\[12]Then they believed his words. They sang his praise.
\[13]They soon forgot his works. They did not wait for his counsel,
\[14]but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and challenged God in the desert.
\[15]And he gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.
\[16]They also envied Moses in the camp, and Aaron the sanctified of Jehovah.
\[17]The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
\[18]And a fire was kindled in their company. The flame burned up the wicked men.
\[19]They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped a molten image.
\[20]Thus they changed their glory for the likeness of an ox that eats grass.
\[21]They forgot God their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,
\[22]wondrous works in the land of Ham, and fearful things by the Red Sea.
\[23]Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy.
\[24]Yea, they despised the pleasant land. They did not believe his word,
\[25]but murmured in their tents, and did not hearken to the voice of Jehovah.
\[26]Therefore he swore to them, that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,
\[27]and that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.
\[28]They also joined themselves to Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
\[29]Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings, and the plague broke in upon them.
\[30]Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment, and so the plague was stayed.
\[31]And that was reckoned to him for righteousness to all generations for evermore.
\[32]They also angered him at the waters of Meribah, so that it went ill with Moses because of them,
\[33]because they were rebellious against his spirit, and he spoke ill-advisedly with his lips.
\[34]They did not destroy the peoples, as Jehovah commanded them,
\[35]but mingled themselves with the nations, and learned their works,
\[36]and served their idols, which became a snare to them.
\[37]Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons,
\[38]and shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. And the land was polluted with blood.
\[39]Thus they were defiled with their works, and played the harlot in their doings.
\[40]Therefore the wrath of Jehovah was kindled against his people, and he abhorred his inheritance.
\[41]And he gave them into the hand of the nations. And those who hated them ruled over them.
\[42]Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
\[43]Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity.
\[44]Nevertheless he regarded their distress when he heard their cry.
\[45]And he remembered his covenant for them, and relented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.
\[46]He also made them to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.
\[47]Save us, O Jehovah our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.

\[4]They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way. They found no city of habitation.
\[5]Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

\[15]O that men would praise Jehovah for his loving kindness, and for his wonderful works to the sons of men!

\[21]O that men would praise Jehovah for his loving kindness, and for his wonderful works to the sons of men!

\[26]They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths. Their soul melts away because of trouble.
\[27]They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.
\[28]Then they cry to Jehovah in their trouble, and he brings them out of their distresses.
\[29]He makes the storm a calm, so that the waves of it are still.
\[30]Then they are glad because they are quiet, so he brings them to their desired haven.
\[31]O that men would praise Jehovah for his loving kindness, and for his wonderful works to the sons of men!
\[32]Let them also exalt him in the assembly of the people, and praise him in the seat of the elders.
\[33]He turns rivers into a wilderness, and water springs into a thirsty ground,
\[34]a fruitful land into a salt desert, for the wickedness of those who dwell therein.
\[35]He turns a wilderness into a pool of water, and a dry land into water springs.
\[36]And there he makes the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city of habitation,
\[37]and sow fields, and plant vineyards, and get fruits of increase.
\[38]He also blesses them, so that they are multiplied greatly, and he does not allow their cattle to decrease.
\[39]Again, they are diminished and bowed down through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
\[40]He pours contempt upon rulers, and causes them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.
\[41]Yet he sets a needy man on high from affliction, and makes him families like a flock.
\[42]The upright shall see it, and be glad. And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.

\[3]to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness and justice and equity,
\[4]to give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion,
\[5]that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning, and that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsels,
\[6]to understand a proverb, and a figure, the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
\[7]The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge. The foolish despise wisdom and instruction.
\[8]My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.
\[9]For they shall be a garland of grace to thy head, and chains about thy neck.
\[10]My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.
\[11]If they say, Come with us. Let us lay wait for blood. Let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.
\[12]Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those who go down into the pit.
\[13]We shall find all precious substance. We shall fill our houses with spoil.
\[14]Thou shall cast thy lot among us. We will all have one bag.
\[15]My son, walk not thou in the way with them. Restrain thy foot from their path.
\[16]For their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.
\[17]For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird,
\[18]and these lay wait for their own blood. They lurk secretly for their own lives.
\[19]So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain. It takes away the life of the owners of it.
\[20]Wisdom cries aloud in the street. She utters her voice in the broad places.
\[21]She cries in the chief place of concourse, at the entrance of the gates, in the city. She utters her words:
\[22]How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? And scoffers delight them in scoffing, and fools hate knowledge?
\[23]Turn back at my reproof. Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you. I will make my words known to you.
\[24]Because I have called, and ye have refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man has regarded,
\[25]but ye have made all my counsel void, and want none of my reproof,
\[26]I also will laugh at your calamity. I will mock when your fear comes,
\[27]when your fear comes as a storm, and your calamity comes on as a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.
\[28]Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer. They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me,
\[29]because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of Jehovah.
\[30]They wanted none of my counsel. They despised all my reproof.
\[31]Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
\[32]For the backsliding of the simple shall kill them, and the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.

\[12]When thou go, thy steps shall not be restricted. And if thou run, thou shall not stumble.
\[13]Take firm hold of instruction. Do not let her go. Keep her, for she is thy life.
\[14]Enter not into the path of the wicked, and walk not in the way of evil men.
\[15]Avoid it. Do not pass by it. Turn from it, and pass on.
\[16]For they do not sleep unless they do evil. And their sleep is taken away unless they cause to fall.
\[17]For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
\[18]But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, that shines more and more to the perfect day.
\[19]The way of the wicked is as darkness. They know not at what they stumble.
\[20]My son, attend to my words. Incline thine ear to my sayings.
\[21]Let them not depart from thine eyes. Keep them in the midst of thy heart.
\[22]For they are life to those who find them, and health to all their flesh.
\[23]Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.
\[24]Put away from thee a wayward mouth, and put perverse lips far from thee.
\[25]Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
\[26]Make the path of thy feet level, and let all thy ways be established.
\[27]Turn not to the right hand nor to the left. Remove thy foot from evil.

y son, attend to my wisdom. Incline thine ear to my understanding,
\[2]that thou may preserve discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.
\[3]For the lips of an interloping woman drop honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil.
\[4]But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
\[5]Her feet go down to death. Her steps take hold on Sheol,
\[6]so that she does not find the level path of life. Her ways are unstable, and she does not know.
\[7]Now therefore, ye sons, hearken to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.
\[8]Remove thy way far from her, and do not come near the door of her house,
\[9]lest thou give thine honor to others, and thy years to the cruel,
\[10]lest strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labors be in the house of an alien,
\[11]and thou mourn at thy latter end when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
\[12]and say, How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof.
\[13]Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to those who instructed me!
\[14]I was almost in all evil in the midst of the assembly and congregation.
\[15]Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.
\[16]Should thy springs be dispersed abroad, and streams of water in the streets?
\[17]Let them be for thyself alone, and not for strangers with thee.
\[18]Let thy fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of thy youth:
\[19]a loving hind and a pleasant doe. Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times, and be thou ravished always with her love.
\[20]For why should thou, my son, be ravished with an interloping woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
\[21]For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah, and he makes level all his paths.
\[22]His own iniquities shall take a wicked man, and he shall be held with the cords of his sin.
\[23]He shall die for lack of instruction. And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.

y son, if thou have become surety for thy neighbor, if thou have struck thy hands for a stranger,
\[2]thou are snared with the words of thy mouth, thou are taken with the words of thy mouth.
\[3]Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, since thou have come into the hand of thy neighbor. Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbor.
\[4]Do not give sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.
\[5]Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
\[6]Go to the ant, thou sluggard. Consider her ways, and be wise.
\[7]Which, having no chief, overseer, or ruler,
\[8]provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest.
\[9]How long will thou sleep, O sluggard? When will thou arise out of thy sleep?
\[10]A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep,
\[11]so thy poverty shall come as a robber, and thy want as an armed man.
\[12]A worthless person, a man of iniquity, is he who walks with a perverse mouth,
\[13]who winks with his eyes, who speaks with his feet, who makes signs with his fingers,
\[14]in whose heart is perverseness, who devises evil continually, who sows discord.
\[15]Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly. Suddenly he shall be broken, and that without remedy.
\[16]There are six things which Jehovah hates, yea, seven which are an abomination to him:
\[17]haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
\[18]a heart that devises wicked purposes, feet that are swift in running to mischief,
\[19]a false witness who utters lies, and he who sows discord among brothers.
\[20]My son, keep the commandment of thy father, and do not forsake the law of thy mother.
\[21]Bind them continually upon thy heart. Tie them about thy neck.
\[22]When thou walk, it shall lead thee. When thou sleep, it shall watch over thee. And when thou awake, it shall talk with thee.
\[23]For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life,
\[24]to keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the stranger's tongue.
\[25]Do not lust after her beauty in thy heart, nor let her take thee with her eyelids.
\[26]For the price of a harlot is as much as a piece of bread, but the adulteress hunts for the precious life.
\[27]Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
\[28]Or can a man walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?
\[29]So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife. Whoever touches her shall not be unpunished.
\[30]Men do not despise a thief, if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry.
\[31]Yet if he is found, he shall restore sevenfold. He shall give all the substance of his house.
\[32]He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding. He who would destroy his own soul does it.
\[33]Wounds and dishonor he shall get, and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
\[34]For jealousy is a man's fury, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
\[35]He will not regard any ransom, nor will he be satisfied, though thou give many gifts.

\[4]Say to wisdom, Thou are my sister, and call understanding thy kinswoman,
\[5]that they may keep thee from the interloping woman, from the stranger who flatters with her words.
\[6]For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice,
\[7]and I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding
\[8]passing through the street near her corner. And he went the way to her house,
\[9]in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle of the night and in the darkness.
\[10]And, behold, there met him a woman attired like a harlot, and wily of heart.
\[11]She is loud and headstrong. Her feet abide not in her house.
\[12]Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, and lies in wait at every corner.
\[13]So she caught him, and kissed him. With an impudent face she said to him,
\[14]Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me. I have paid my vows this day.
\[15]Therefore I came forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
\[16]I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.
\[17]I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
\[18]Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning. Let us solace ourselves with love.
\[19]For the man is not at home. He has gone a long journey.
\[20]He has taken a bag of money with him. He will come home at the full moon.
\[21]With her much fair speech she causes him to yield. With the flattering of her lips she forces him along.
\[22]He goes after her straightaway, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks,
\[23]till an arrow strikes through his liver, as a bird hastens to the snare. And he does not know that it is for his life.
\[24]Now therefore, ye sons, hearken to me, and attend to the words of my mouth.
\[25]Let not thy heart decline to her ways. Go not astray in her paths.
\[26]For she has cast down many wounded. Yea, all her slain are a mighty host.

\[4]To you, O men, I call. And my voice is to the sons of men.
\[5]O ye simple, understand prudence, and, ye fools, be of an understanding heart.
\[6]Hear, for I will speak excellent things. And the opening of my lips shall be right things.

\[20]I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice,
\[21]that I may cause those who love me to inherit substance, and that I may fill their treasuries.
\[22]Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.
\[23]I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, before the earth was,
\[24]when there were no depths. I was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with water,
\[25]before the mountains were settled, before the hills. I was brought forth
\[26]while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
\[27]When he established the heavens, I was there. When he set a circle upon the face of the deep,
\[28]when he made firm the skies above, when the fountains of the deep became strong,
\[29]when he gave to the sea its bound that the waters should not transgress his commandment, when he marked out the foundations of the earth,
\[30]then I was by him, a master workman. And I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him,
\[31]rejoicing in his habitable earth. And my delight was with the sons of men.
\[32]Now therefore, ye sons, hearken to me. For blessed are those who keep my ways.
\[33]Hear instruction, and be wise, and do not refuse it.
\[34]Blessed is the man who hears me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
\[35]For he who finds me finds life, and shall obtain favor of Jehovah.

\[4]Take away the dross from the silver, and there comes forth a vessel for the refiner.
\[5]Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.
\[6]Put not thyself forward in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men.
\[7]For it is better that it be said to thee, Come up here, than that thou should be put lower in the presence of the prince, whom thine eyes have seen.
\[8]Go not forth hastily to strive. What will thou do in the end of it when thy neighbor has put thee to shame?
\[9]Debate thy case with thy neighbor himself, and disclose not the secret of another,
\[10]lest he who hears it revile thee, and thine infamy turn not away.
\[11]A word fitly spoken is apples of gold in a network of silver.
\[12]An earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.
\[13]As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, is a faithful messenger to those who send him, for he refreshes the soul of his masters.
\[14]Clouds and wind without rain, is he who boasts himself of his gifts falsely.
\[15]By long-suffering a ruler is persuaded, and a soft tongue breaks the bone.
\[16]Have thou found honey? Eat as much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled with it, and vomit it.
\[17]Let thy foot be seldom in thy neighbor's house, lest he be weary of thee, and hate thee.
\[18]A man who bears false witness against his neighbor is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
\[19]Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
\[20]As he who takes off a garment in cold weather, and vinegar upon soda, so is he who sings songs to a heavy heart.
\[21]If thine enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.
\[22]For thou will heap coals of fire upon his head, and Jehovah will reward thee.
\[23]The north wind brings forth rain. So does a backbiting tongue, an angry countenance.
\[24]It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a contentious woman in a wide house.
\[25]As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.
\[26]A troubled fountain, and a corrupted spring, is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked.
\[27]It is not good to eat much honey, so for men to search out their own glory is grievous.
\[28]He whose spirit is without restraint is a city that is broken down and without walls.

\[15]The sluggard buries his hand in the dish. It wearies him to bring it again to his mouth.
\[16]The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men who can render a reason.

\[18]As a madman who casts firebrands, arrows, and death,
\[19]so is the man who deceives his neighbor, and says, Am I not in sport?
\[20]For lack of wood the fire goes out, and where there is no whisperer, contention ceases.
\[21]As coals are to hot embers, and wood to fire, so is a contentious man to inflame strife.
\[22]The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, and they go down into the innermost parts.
\[23]Fervent lips and a wicked heart are an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross.
\[24]He who hates masquerades with his lips, but he lays up deceit within him.
\[25]When he speaks graciously, believe him not, for there are seven abominations in his heart.
\[26]Though his hatred cover itself with guile, his wickedness shall be openly shown before the assembly.
\[27]He who digs a pit shall fall in it, and he who rolls a stone, it shall return upon him.

\[14]He who blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be considered a curse to him.
\[15]A continual dropping in a very rainy day, and a contentious woman are alike.

\[17]Iron sharpens iron, so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.
\[18]He who keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit of it, and he who regards his master shall be honored.
\[19]As in water face is to face, so the heart of a man is to a man.
\[20]Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied, and the eyes of man are never satisfied.
\[21]The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold, and a man is tried by his praise.
\[22]Though thou should pound a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain, yet his foolishness will not depart from him.
\[23]Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.
\[24]For riches are not forever. And does the crown endure to all generations?
\[25]The hay is carried, and the tender grass shows itself, and the herbs of the mountains are gathered in.
\[26]The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the cost of the field.
\[27]And then will be goats' milk enough for thy food; for the food of thy household, and maintenance for thy maidens.

\[2]Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man,
\[3]and I have not learned wisdom, nor have I the knowledge of the Holy.
\[4]Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended? Who has gathered the wind in his fists? Who has bound the waters in his garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou know?
\[5]Every word of God is tried. He is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
\[6]Add thou not to his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
\[7]Two things I have asked of thee, deny me not before I die:
\[8]Remove far from me falsehood and lies. Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me,
\[9]lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is Jehovah? or lest I be poor, and steal, and use the name of my God profanely.
\[10]Slander not a servant to his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be held guilty.
\[11]There is a generation who curses their father, and does not bless their mother.
\[12]There is a generation who are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not washed from their filthiness.
\[13]There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes, and their eyelids are lifted up.
\[14]There is a generation whose teeth are swords, and their jaw teeth, knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.
\[15]The leach has two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four that do not say, Enough:
\[16]Sheol, and the barren womb, the earth that is not satisfied with water, and the fire that does not say, Enough.
\[17]The eye that mocks at his father, and despises to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.
\[18]There are three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:
\[19]The way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man with a maiden.
\[20]So is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats, and wipes her mouth, and says, I have done no iniquity.
\[21]For three things the earth trembles, and for four, which it cannot bear:
\[22]For a servant when he is king, and a fool when he is filled with food,
\[23]for a hateful woman when she is married, and a handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
\[24]There are four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceedingly wise:
\[25]The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their food in the summer,
\[26]the conies are but a feeble folk, yet they make their houses in the rocks,
\[27]the locusts have no king, yet they go forth all of them by bands,
\[28]the lizard takes hold with her hands, yet she is in kings' palaces.
\[29]There are three things which are stately in their march, yea, four which are stately in going:
\[30]The lion, which is mightiest among beasts, and turns not away from any,
\[31]the greyhound, also the he-goat, and the king against whom there is no rising up.
\[32]If thou have done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou have thought evil, lay thy hand upon thy mouth.

\[8]Open thy mouth for the mute, in the cause of all such as are left desolate.

\[13]She seeks wool and flax, and works willingly with her hands.
\[14]She is like the merchant ships: she brings her bread from afar.

\[16]She considers a field, and buys it. With the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
\[17]She girds her loins with strength, and makes strong her arms.
\[18]She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out by night.
\[19]She lays her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.
\[20]She stretches out her hand to the poor, yea, she reaches forth her hands to the needy.
\[21]She is not afraid of the snow for her household, for all her household are clothed with scarlet.
\[22]She makes for herself carpets of tapestry. Her clothing is fine linen and purple.
\[23]Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land.
\[24]She makes linen garments and sells them, and delivers girdles to the merchant.
\[25]Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come.
\[26]She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the law of kindness is on her tongue.
\[27]She looks well to the ways of her household, and does not eat the bread of idleness.
\[28]Her sons rise up, and call her blessed. Her husband also, and he praises her.
\[29]Many daughters have done worthily, but thou excel them all.
\[30]Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears Jehovah, she shall be praised.
\[31]Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her in the gates.

\[2]Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities, all is vanity.
\[3]What profit has man from all his labor in which he labors under the sun?
\[4]One generation goes, and another generation comes, but the earth abides forever.
\[5]The sun also arises, and the sun goes down and hastens to its place where it arises.
\[6]The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually in its course, and the wind returns again to its circuits.
\[7]All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place from where the rivers come, there they go again.
\[8]All things are full of weariness, man cannot utter it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
\[9]That which has been is that which shall be, and that which has been done is that which shall be done. And there is no new thing under the sun.
\[10]Is there a thing of which it may be said, See, this is new? It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.
\[11]There is no remembrance of the former things, nor shall there be any remembrance of the latter that are to come, among those who shall come after.
\[12]I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
\[13]And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven. It is a great tribulation that God has given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.
\[14]I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.
\[15]That which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
\[16]I communed with my own heart, saying, Lo, I have gotten for me great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yea, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
\[17]And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.

 said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure. And, behold, this also was vanity.
\[2]I said of laughter, It is mad, and of mirth, What does it do?
\[3]I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine (my heart yet guiding me with wisdom), and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their life.
\[4]I made for me great works. I built for me houses. I planted for me vineyards.
\[5]I made for me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit.
\[6]I made for me pools of water, to water from there the forest where trees were reared.
\[7]I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house. I also had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all who were before me in Jerusalem.
\[8]I also gathered for me silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got for me men-singers and women-singers, and the luxuries of the sons of men, and a wife and wives.
\[9]So I was great, and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me.
\[10]And whatever my eyes desired I kept not from them. I did not withhold my heart from any joy. For my heart rejoiced because of all my labor, and this was my portion from all my labor.
\[11]Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do, and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.
\[12]And I turned myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly. For what can the man do who comes after the king? Even that which has been done long ago.
\[13]Then I saw that wisdom excels folly as far as light excels darkness.
\[14]The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness. And yet I perceived that one event happens to them all.
\[15]Then I said in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so it will happen even to me, and why then was I more wise? Then I said in my heart that this also is vanity.
\[16]For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance forever, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how the wise man dies even as the fool!
\[17]So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous to me. For all is vanity and a striving after wind.
\[18]And I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who shall be after me.
\[19]And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have rule over all my labor in which I have labored, and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.
\[20]Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor in which I had labored under the sun.
\[21]For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skillfulness, yet he shall leave it to a man who has not labored in it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.
\[22]For what has a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart in which he labors under the sun?
\[23]For all his days are but sorrows, and his travail is grief, yea, even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity.
\[24]There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.
\[25]For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, without him?
\[26]For to the man who pleases him God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who pleases God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.

\[9]What profit has he who works in that in which he labors?
\[10]I have seen the travail which God has given to the sons of men to be employed therewith.

\[15]That which is, has been long ago, and that which is to be, has long ago been. And God seeks again that which has passed away.
\[16]And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there, and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.
\[17]I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous man and the wicked man, for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.
\[18]I said in my heart, It is because of the sons of men, that God may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves are beasts.
\[19]For that which befalls the sons of men befalls beasts, even one thing befalls them; as the one dies, so dies the other. Yea, they all have one breath, and man has no preeminence above the beasts; for all is vanity.
\[20]All go to one place. All are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
\[21]Who knows the spirit of man, whether it goes upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goes downward to the earth?

\[8]There is one man who is alone, and he has not a second, yea, he has neither son nor brother. Yet there is no end of all his labor, nor are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, he says, do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity, yea, it is a great travail.
\[9]Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.
\[10]For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow, but woe to him who is alone when he falls, and has not another to lift him up.
\[11]Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth, but how can one be warm alone?
\[12]And if a man prevails against him who is alone, two shall withstand him. And a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
\[13]Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who does not know how to receive admonition any more.
\[14]For he came forth out of prison to be king, yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor.
\[15]I saw all the living who walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, who stood up in his stead.
\[16]There was no end of all the people, even of all those over whom he was. Yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.

eep thy foot when thou go to the house of God, for to draw near to hear is better than to give the sacrifice of fools. For they know not that they do evil.
\[2]Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before God. For God is in heaven, and thou upon earth. Therefore let thy words be few.
\[3]For a dream comes with a multitude of business, and a fool's voice with a multitude of words.
\[4]When thou vow a vow to God, defer not to pay it, for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay that which thou vow.
\[5]Better is it that thou should not vow, than that thou should vow and not pay.
\[6]Do not allow thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin, nor say thou before the agent, that is was an error. Why should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?
\[7]For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, and in many words. But fear thou God.
\[8]If thou see the oppression of a poor man, and the violent wresting of justice and righteousness in a province, marvel not at the matter. For a man higher than the high is observing, and there are higher men than they.
\[9]Moreover the abundance of the land is for all. The king himself is served by the field.
\[10]He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver, nor he who loves abundance, with increase. This also is vanity.
\[11]When goods increase, they are increased who eat them. And what advantage is there to the owner of it, except the beholding of them with his eyes?
\[12]The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much, but the fullness of the rich will not allow him to sleep.
\[13]There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: Riches were kept by the owner of it to his hurt.
\[14]And those riches perish in a bad venture. And if he has begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand.
\[15]As he came forth from his mother's womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.
\[16]And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go. And what profit has he that he labored for the wind?
\[17]All his days also he eats in gloom, and he is greatly troubled, and has depression and anger.
\[18]Behold, that which I have seen to be good and to be fitting is for a man to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor in which he labors under the sun all the days of his life which God has given him, for this is his portion.
\[19]Every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor-this is the gift of God.
\[20]For he shall not much remember the days of his life, because God answers him in the joy of his heart.

here is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy upon men:
\[2]A man to whom God gives riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet God does not give him power to eat of it, but an alien eats it. This is vanity, and it is an evil disease.
\[3]If a man begets a hundred sons, and lives many years so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not filled with good, and moreover he has no burial, I say, that an untimely birth is better than he.
\[4]For it comes in vanity, and departs in darkness, and the name of it is covered with darkness.
\[5]Moreover it has not seen the sun nor known it, this one has rest rather than the other.
\[6]Yea, though he lives a thousand years twice told, and yet enjoys no good, do not all go to one place?
\[7]All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.
\[8]For what advantage has the wise man more than the fool? What has the poor man, who knows how to walk before the living?
\[9]Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
\[10]Whatever has been, the name of it was given long ago, and it is know what man is. Neither can he contend with him who is mightier than he.
\[11]Since there are many things that increase vanity, what is man the better?
\[12]For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he spends as a shadow? For who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?

 good name is better than precious oil, and the day of death, than the day of birth.
\[2]It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting. For that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart.
\[3]Sorrow is better than laughter, for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made glad.
\[4]The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
\[5]It is better to hear the rebuke of a wise man, than for a man to hear the song of fools.
\[6]For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity.
\[7]Surely oppression makes the wise man foolish, and a bribe destroys the understanding.
\[8]Better is the end of a thing than the beginning of it. The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
\[9]Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry, for anger rests in the bosom of fools.
\[10]Say thou not, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? For thou do not inquire wisely concerning this.
\[11]Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, yea, it is more excellent for those who see the sun.
\[12]For wisdom is a defense, even as money is a defense. But the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.
\[13]Consider the work of God. For who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?
\[14]In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider. Yea, God has made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything after him.
\[15]All this I have seen in my days of vanity. There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his evil-doing.
\[16]Be not over-righteous, nor show thyself too wise. Why should thou destroy thyself?
\[17]Do not much wrong, nor be thou a fool. Why should thou die before thy time?
\[18]It is good that thou should take hold of this, yea, also from that withdraw not thy hand. For he who fears God shall come forth from them all.
\[19]Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city.
\[20]Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth that does good, and sins not.
\[21]Also do not take heed to all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee.
\[22]For many times also thine own heart knows that thou thyself likewise have cursed others.
\[23]All this I have proved in wisdom. I said, I will be wise, but it was far from me.
\[24]That which is, is far off and exceedingly deep. Who can find it out?
\[25]I turned about, and my heart was set to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the reason of things, and to know that wickedness is folly, and that foolishness is madness.
\[26]And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are chains. He who pleases God shall escape from her, but the sinner shall be taken by her.
\[27]Behold, I have found this, says the Preacher, laying one thing to another, to find out the account,
\[28]which my soul still seeks, but I have not found: among a thousand I have found one man, but among all those I have not found a woman.

\[2]I say, Keep the king's command, and that because of the oath of God.
\[3]Be not hasty to go out of his presence. Persist not in an evil matter, for he does whatever pleases him.
\[4]For the king's word has power, and who may say to him, What are thou doing?
\[5]He who keeps a commandment shall know no evil thing. And a wise man's heart discerns the time and decision.
\[6]For to every purpose there is a time and decision, although the distress of man is great upon him.
\[7]For he knows not that which shall be, for who can tell him how it shall be?
\[8]There is no man who has power over the spirit to retain the spirit, nor has he power over the day of death. And there is no discharge in war. Neither shall wickedness deliver him who is given to it.
\[9]All this I have seen, and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun. There is a time in which one man has power over another to his hurt.
\[10]So I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were praised in the city where they had so done. This also is vanity.
\[11]Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
\[12]Though a sinner does evil a hundred times, and prolongs his days, yet surely I know that it shall be well with those who fear God, who fear before him.
\[13]But it shall not be well with a wicked man, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he did not fear before God.
\[14]There is a vanity which is done upon the earth, that there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked, again, there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.
\[15]Then I commended joy, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be cheerful. For that shall abide with him in his labor all the days of his life which God has given him under the sun.
\[16]When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth (for also there is he who sees sleep with his eyes neither day nor night),
\[17]then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. Because however much a man labors to seek it out, yet he shall not find it. Yea moreover, though a wise man thinks to know it, yet he shall not be able to find it.

or all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God. No man understands, either love or hatred. All is before them.
\[2]All things come alike to all. There is one event to the righteous man and to the wicked man, to the good man, and to the clean man, and to the unclean man, to him who sacrifices and to him who does not sacrifice, as is the good man, so is the sinner, and he who swears, as he who fears an oath.
\[3]This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event to all. Yea also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.
\[4]Because to him who is joined with all the living there is hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
\[5]For the living know that they shall die, but the dead know not anything, nor have they any more a reward, for the memory of them is forgotten.
\[6]As well their love, as their hatred and their envy, has perished long ago, nor have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun.
\[7]Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart, for God has already accepted thy works.
\[8]Let thy garments be always white, and let not thy head lack oil.
\[9]Live joyfully with the wife whom thou love all the days of thy life of vanity, which he has given thee under the sun, all thy days of vanity. For that is thy portion in life, and in thy labor in which thou labor under the sun.
\[10]Whatever thy hand finds to do, do with thy might, for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Sheol, where thou go.
\[11]I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill, but time and chance happens to them all.
\[12]For man also does not know his time. As the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time when it falls suddenly upon them.
\[13]I have also seen wisdom under the sun this way, and it seemed great to me:
\[14]There was a little city, and few men within it. And there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.
\[15]Now there was found in it a poor wise man. And he by his wisdom delivered the city, yet no man remembered that same poor man.
\[16]Then I said, Wisdom is better than strength. Nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.
\[17]The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him who rules among fools.

\[11]If the serpent bites before it is charmed, then is there no advantage in the charmer.
\[12]The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious, but the lips of a fool will swallow himself up.
\[13]The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.
\[14]A fool also multiplies words; yet man knows not what shall be, and that which shall be after him, who can tell him?
\[15]The labor of fools wearies every one of them, for he knows not how to go to the city.

\[11]His head is the most fine gold. His locks are bushy, black as a raven.
\[12]His eyes are like doves beside the water-brooks, washed with milk, fitly set.
\[13]His cheeks are as a bed of spices, banks of sweet herbs. His lips are lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.
\[14]His hands are rings of gold set with beryl. His body is ivory work overlaid with sapphires.
\[15]His legs are pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold. His aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
\[16]His mouth is most sweet. Yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.

\[4]Thou are fair, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, sublime as an army with banners.
\[5]Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats that lie along the side of Gilead.
\[6]Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes, which have come up from the washing, of which every one has twins, and none is bereaved among them.
\[7]Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind thy veil.
\[8]There are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and virgins without number.
\[9]My dove, my undefiled, is but one. She is the only one of her mother. She is the choice one of her who bore her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed, yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
\[10]Who is she who looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, sublime as an army with banners?
\[11]I went down into the garden of nuts, to see the green plants of the valley, to see whether the vine budded, and the pomegranates were in flower.
\[12]Before I was aware, my soul set me among the chariots of my princely people.

\[5]Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thy head like purple. The king is held captive in the tresses.
\[6]How fair and how pleasant thou are, O love, for delights!
\[7]This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to its clusters.
\[8]I said, I will climb up into the palm tree. I will take hold of the branches of it. Let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy breath like apples,
\[9]and thy mouth like the best wine, that goes down smoothly for my beloved, gliding through the lips and teeth.
\[10]I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.
\[11]Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field. Let us lodge in the villages.
\[12]Let us get up early to the vineyards. Let us see whether the vine has budded, its blossom is open, the pomegranates are in flower. There I will give thee my love.

\[3]His left hand under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.
\[4]I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake love, until it please.

\[6]Set me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thine arm. For love is strong as death, jealousy is cruel as Sheol. The flashes of it are flashes of fire, a most vehement flame.
\[7]Many waters cannot quench love, nor can floods drown it. If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, he would be utterly scorned.
\[8]We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
\[9]If she is a wall, we will build upon her a turret of silver. And if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.

\[11]Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon. He let out the vineyard to keepers. Every one for the fruit of it was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.

\[13]Thou who dwell in the gardens, the companions hearken for thy voice. Cause me to hear it.

he vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
\[2]Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for Jehovah has spoken. I have nourished and brought up sons, and they have rebelled against me.
\[3]The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib, but Israel does not know; my people does not consider.
\[4]Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, sons who deal corruptly! They have forsaken Jehovah. They have despised the Holy One of Israel. They have gone away backward.
\[5]Why will ye still be stricken, that ye revolt more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
\[6]From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it, but wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes. They have not been closed nor bound up nor soothed with oil.
\[7]Your country is desolate. Your cities are burned with fire. Your land-strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
\[8]And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a shed in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
\[9]Unless Jehovah of hosts had left to us a seed, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like Gomorrah.
\[10]Hear the word of Jehovah, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.
\[11]What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says Jehovah. I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts. And I do not delight in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he-goats.
\[12]When ye come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand-to trample my courts?
\[13]Bring no more vain oblations. Incense is an abomination to me. New moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies-I cannot bear iniquity and the solemn meeting.
\[14]Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They are a trouble to me. I am weary of bearing them.
\[15]And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you. Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.
\[16]Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes. Cease to do evil.
\[17]Learn to do good. Seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
\[18]Come now, and let us reason together, says Jehovah, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
\[19]If ye are willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.
\[20]But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword, for the mouth of Jehovah has spoken it.
\[21]How the faithful city has become a harlot! She who was full of justice! Righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.
\[22]Thy silver has become dross, thy wine mixed with water.
\[23]Thy rulers are rebellious, and companions of thieves. Everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards. They judge not the fatherless, nor does the cause of the widow come to them.
\[24]Therefore says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies.
\[25]And I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin.
\[26]And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning. Afterward thou shall be called the city of righteousness, a faithful town.
\[27]Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.
\[28]But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together, and those who forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.
\[29]For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.
\[30]For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.
\[31]And the strong man shall be as flax, and his work as a spark. And they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.

\[2]And it shall come to pass in the latter days, that the mountain of Jehovah's house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow to it.
\[3]And many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.
\[4]And he will judge between the nations, and will decide concerning many peoples, and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
\[5]O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.
\[6]For thou have forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they are filled with things from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines. And they strike hands with the children of foreigners.
\[7]And their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures. Their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots.
\[8]Their land is also full of idols. They worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made,
\[9]and so the common man bows down, and the great man degrades himself. Therefore do not forgive them.
\[10]Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty.
\[11]The lofty looks of man shall be brought low, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.
\[12]For there shall be a day of Jehovah of hosts upon all that is proud and haughty, and upon all that is lifted up, and it shall be brought low,
\[13]and upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,
\[14]and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,
\[15]and upon every lofty tower, and upon every fortified wall,
\[16]and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant imagery.
\[17]And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low, and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.
\[18]And the idols shall utterly pass away.
\[19]And men shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty, when he arises to shake the earth mightily.
\[20]In that day men shall cast away their idols of silver, and their idols of gold, which have been made for them to worship, to the moles and to the bats,
\[21]to go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty, when he arises to shake the earth mightily.

\[16]Moreover Jehovah said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet,
\[17]therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts.

\[2]And he dug it, and gathered out the stones of it, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress in it. And he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
\[3]And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.
\[4]What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it? Why, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, it brought forth wild grapes?
\[5]And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will take away the hedge of it, and it shall be eaten up. I will break down the wall of it, and it shall be trodden down.
\[6]And I will lay it waste. It shall not be pruned nor hoed, but there shall come up briers and thorns. I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
\[7]For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant. And he looked for justice, but behold, oppression, for righteousness, but behold, a cry.
\[8]Woe to those who join house to house, who lay field to field, till there is no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!
\[9]In my ears says Jehovah of hosts, of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.
\[10]For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah.
\[11]Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink, who tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them!
\[12]And the harp and the lute, the tambourine and the pipe, and wine, are in their feasts, but they do not regard the work of Jehovah, nor have they considered the operation of his hands.
\[13]Therefore my people have gone into captivity for lack of knowledge, and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.
\[14]Therefore Sheol has enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without measure. And their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he who rejoices among them, descend into it.
\[15]And the common man is bowed down, and the great man is debased, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled,
\[16]but Jehovah of hosts is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.
\[17]Then the lambs shall feed as in their pasture, and wanderers shall eat the waste places of the fat ones.
\[18]Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope,
\[19]who say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it. And let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!
\[20]Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil, who put darkness for light, and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
\[21]Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!
\[22]Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink,
\[23]who justify the wicked for rewards, and take away the justice of the righteous man from him!
\[24]Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust, because they have rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
\[25]Therefore the anger of Jehovah is kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them, and has smitten them. And the mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
\[26]And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will whistle for them from the end of the earth, and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.
\[27]None shall be weary nor stumble among them. None shall slumber nor sleep, nor shall the belt of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken,
\[28]whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent. Their horses' hoofs shall be accounted as flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind.
\[29]Their roaring shall be like a lioness. They shall roar like young lions. Yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver.
\[30]And they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea. And if a man looks to the land, behold, darkness and distress, and the light is darkened in the clouds of it.

\[10]Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn, and be healed.

\[12]and Jehovah has removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.

\[2]And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is allied with Ephraim. And his heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.
\[3]Then Jehovah said to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller's field.
\[4]And say to him, Take heed, and be quiet. Fear not, nor let thy heart be faint, because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
\[5]Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have purposed evil against thee, saying,
\[6]Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach in it for us, and set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeel,

\[8]For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. And within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces, so that is shall not be a people.
\[9]And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.
\[10]And Jehovah spoke again to Ahaz, saying,
\[11]Ask thee a sign of Jehovah thy God, ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.
\[12]But Ahaz said, I will not ask, nor will I test Jehovah.
\[13]And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David. Is it a small thing for you to weary men, that ye will weary my God also?
\[14]Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
\[15]Butter and honey shall he eat, when he knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
\[16]For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings thou abhor shall be forsaken.
\[17]Jehovah will bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah-even the king of Assyria.
\[18]And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will whistle for the fly that is in the outermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
\[19]And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and upon all thorn-hedges, and upon all pastures.
\[20]In that day the Lord will shave with a razor what is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet, and it shall also consume the beard.
\[21]And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall keep alive a young cow and two sheep.
\[22]And it shall come to pass, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter. For everyone who is left in the midst of the land shall eat butter and honey.
\[23]And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver coins, shall be for briers and thorns.

\[14]And he shall be for a sanctuary, but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a net and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[15]And many shall stumble on it, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.
\[16]Bind thou up the testimony. Seal the law among my disciples.
\[17]And I will wait for Jehovah, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will be a man who has trusted in him.

\[2]The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. Those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them the light has shone.
\[3]Thou have multiplied the nation. Thou have increased their joy. They joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
\[4]For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, thou have broken as in the day of Midian.
\[5]For all the armor of the armed man in the tumult, and the garments rolled in blood, shall be for burning, for fuel of fire.
\[6]For to us a child is born, to us a son is given. And the government shall be upon his shoulder. And his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace.
\[7]Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from henceforth even forever. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.
\[8]The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it has lighted upon Israel.
\[9]And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart,
\[10]The bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stone, the sycamores are cut down, but we will put cedars in their place.
\[11]Therefore Jehovah will set up on high against him the adversaries of Rezin, and will stir up his enemies,
\[12]the Syrians in front, and the Philistines behind, and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
\[13]Yet the people have not turned to him who smote them, nor have they sought Jehovah of hosts.
\[14]Therefore Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, in one day.
\[15]The elder and the honorable man, he is the head. And the prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail.
\[16]For those who lead this people cause them to err, and those who are led by them are destroyed.
\[17]Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men, nor will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows. For everyone is profane and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
\[18]For wickedness burns as the fire. It devours the briers and thorns. Yea, it kindles in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.
\[19]Through the wrath of Jehovah of hosts is the land burnt up, and the people are as the fuel of fire; no man spares his brother.
\[20]And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry. And he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied. They shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm-
\[21]Manasseh, Ephraim, and Ephraim, Manasseh, and together they shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

\[7]However he does not so reason, nor does his heart so think, but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few.
\[8]For he says, Are not my rulers all of them kings?
\[9]Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not Samaria as Damascus?
\[10]As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose graven images excelled those of Jerusalem and of Samaria,
\[11]shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
\[12]Therefore it shall come to pass, that, when the Lord has performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.
\[13]For he has said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I have understanding. And I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures. And like a valiant man I have brought down those who sit on thrones.
\[14]And my hand has found as a nest the riches of the peoples. And like a gathering of eggs that are forsaken, I have gathered all the earth. And there was none that moved the wing, or that opened the mouth, or chirped.
\[15]Shall the axe boast itself against him who hews with it? Shall the saw magnify itself against him who wields it? As if a rod should wield those who lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up him who is not wood.
\[16]Therefore will the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, send among his fat ones, leanness, and under his glory there shall be kindled a burning like the burning of fire.
\[17]And the light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame, and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.
\[18]And he will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body. And it shall be as when a standard-bearer faints.
\[19]And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child may write them.
\[20]And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and those who are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again lean upon him who smote them, but shall lean upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
\[21]A remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
\[22]For though thy people, Israel, be as the sand of the sea, a remnant of them shall return. A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness.
\[23]For a full end, and that determined, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, will make in the midst of all the earth.
\[24]Therefore thus says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, O my people who dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian, though he smites thee with the rod, and lifts up his staff against thee, according to the manner of Egypt.
\[25]For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall be accomplished, and my anger is to his destruction.
\[26]And Jehovah of hosts will stir up against him a scourge as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb. And his rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up according to the manner of Egypt.
\[27]And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall depart from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of fatness.

\[31]Madmenah is a fugitive. The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.
\[32]This very day he shall halt at Nob. He shakes his hand at the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
\[33]Behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, will lop off the boughs with terror. And the high of stature shall be hewn down, and the lofty shall be brought low.

\[14]Jehovah has mingled a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her, and they have caused Egypt to go astray in every work of it, as a drunken man staggers in his vomit.
\[15]Neither shall there be for Egypt any work, which head or tail, palm-branch or rush, may do.
\[16]In that day the Egyptians shall be like women, and they shall tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of hosts, which he shakes over them.
\[17]And the land of Judah shall become a terror to Egypt. Everyone to whom mention is made of it shall be afraid because of the purpose of Jehovah of hosts, which he purposes against it.
\[18]In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Jehovah of hosts. One shall be called The city of destruction.
\[19]In that day shall there be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Jehovah at the border of it.
\[20]And it shall be for a sign and for a witness to Jehovah of hosts in the land of Egypt. For they shall cry to Jehovah because of oppressors, and he will send them a savior, and a defender, and he will deliver them.
\[21]And Jehovah shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know Jehovah in that day. Yea, they shall worship with sacrifice and oblation, and shall vow a vow to Jehovah, and shall perform it.
\[22]And Jehovah will smite Egypt, smiting and healing, and they shall return to Jehovah. And he will be entreated by them, and will heal them.
\[23]In that day there shall be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria. And the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall worship with the Assyrians.
\[24]In that day Israel shall be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth,
\[25]in that Jehovah of hosts has blessed them, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.

\[2]at that time Jehovah spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go, and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put thy shoe from off thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.
\[3]And Jehovah said, Just as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia,
\[4]so shall the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt, and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
\[5]And they shall be dismayed and confounded because of Ethiopia their confidence, and of Egypt their glory.

\[3]Therefore my loins are filled with anguish. Pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail. I am pained so that I cannot hear. I am dismayed so that I cannot see.

\[3]All thy rulers fled away together. They were bound by the archers. All who were found of thee were bound together; they fled afar off.
\[4]Therefore I said, Look away from me. I will weep bitterly. Labor not to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
\[5]For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, in the valley of vision, a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.
\[6]And Elam bore the quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.
\[7]And it came to pass, that thy choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.
\[8]And he took away the covering of Judah, and thou looked in that day to the armor in the house of the forest.

\[13]And, behold, joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine. Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die.
\[14]And Jehovah of hosts revealed himself in my ears, Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you till ye die, says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.
\[15]Thus says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, Go, get thee to this treasurer, even to Shebna, who is over the house, and say,
\[16]What are thou doing here? And whom have thou here, that thou have hewed thee out here a sepulcher? Hewing him out a sepulcher on high, carving a habitation for himself in the rock!
\[17]Behold, Jehovah, like a strong man, will hurl thee away violently. Yea, he will wrap thee up closely.
\[18]He will surely wind thee round and round, tossing like a ball into a large country. There thou shall die, and there the chariots of thy glory shall be, thou shame of thy lord's house.
\[19]And I will thrust thee from thine office, and thou shall be pulled down from thy station.
\[20]And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah.
\[21]And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy belt. And I will commit thy government into his hand, and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.
\[22]And I will lay the key of the house of David upon his shoulder, and he shall open, and none shall shut, and he shall shut, and none shall open.
\[23]And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place, and he shall be for a throne of glory to his father's house.
\[24]And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the flagons.
\[25]In that day, says Jehovah of hosts, the nail that was fastened in a sure place shall give way, and it shall be hewn down, and fall. And the burden that was upon it shall be cut off, for Jehovah has spoken it.

\[20]The earth shall stagger like a drunken man, and shall sway to and fro like a hammock. And the transgression of it shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall, and not rise again.
\[21]And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will punish the host of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.

\[12]to whom he said, This is the rest. Give ye rest to him who is weary. And this is the refreshing. Yet they would not hear.
\[13]Therefore the word of Jehovah shall be to them precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little, that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
\[14]Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, ye scoffers, who rule this people that is in Jerusalem.
\[15]Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and we are at agreement with Sheol. When the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come to us, for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hid ourselves under falsehood.
\[16]Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner-stone, a sure foundation. He who believes in him shall, no, not be shamed.
\[17]And I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plummet. And the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.
\[18]And your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand. When the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.
\[19]As often as it passes though, it shall take you. For morning by morning it shall pass through, by day and by night. And it shall be nothing but terror to understand the report.
\[20]For the bed is shorter than what a man can stretch himself on it, and the covering narrower than what he can wrap himself in it.
\[21]For Jehovah will rise up as in mount Perazim. He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work, and bring to pass his act, his strange act.
\[22]Now therefore be ye not scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong. For I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, upon the whole earth.
\[23]Give ye ear, and hear my voice, hearken, and hear my speech.
\[24]Does he who plows to sow plow continually? Does he continually open and harrow his ground?

\[26]For his God instructs him aright, and teaches him.
\[27]For the chick-peas are not threshed with a sharp instrument, nor is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin, but the chick-peas are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.
\[28]Bread grain is ground, for he will not be always threshing it. And though the wheel of his cart and his horses scatter it, he does not grind it.

\[11]And all vision has become to you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to a man who is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee. And he says, I cannot, for it is sealed.
\[12]And the book is delivered to him who is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee. And he says, I am not learned.
\[13]And the Lord said, Inasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips, but have removed their heart far from me, but in vain they worship me, teaching the commandments and doctrines of men.
\[14]Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder. I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hidden.

\[17]Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?
\[18]And in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.
\[19]The meek also shall increase their joy in Jehovah, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
\[20]For the terrible one is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases. And all those who watch for iniquity are cut off,
\[21]who make a man an offender in his cause, and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nothing.

oe to the rebellious sons, says Jehovah, who take counsel, but not of me, and who make a league, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin,
\[2]who set out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth, to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!
\[3]Therefore the strength of Pharaoh shall be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.
\[4]For their rulers are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have come to Hanes.
\[5]They shall all be ashamed because of a people who cannot profit them, who are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.
\[6]The burden of the beasts of the South. Through the land of trouble and anguish, from where come the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches upon the shoulders of young donkeys, and their treasures upon the humps of camels, to a people who shall not profit them.
\[7]For Egypt helps in vain, and to no purpose. Therefore I have called her Rahab who sits still.
\[8]Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it on a scroll, that it may be for the time to come forever and ever.
\[9]For it is a rebellious people, lying sons, sons who will not hear the law of Jehovah,
\[10]who say to the seers, Do not see, and to the prophets, Do not prophesy to us right things. Speak to us smooth things. Prophesy deceits.
\[11]Get you out of the way. Turn aside out of the path. Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.
\[12]Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely on it,
\[13]therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant.
\[14]And he shall break it as a potter's vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing, so that there shall not be found among the pieces of it a shard with which to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.
\[15]For thus said the lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, Ye shall be saved in returning and rest. Your strength shall be in quietness and in confidence. And ye would not,
\[16]but ye said, No, for we will flee upon horses. Therefore ye shall flee. And ye said, We will ride upon the swift. Therefore those who pursue you shall be swift.
\[17]One thousand shall flee at the threat of one. Ye shall flee at the threat of five, till ye are left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill.
\[18]And therefore Jehovah will wait, that he may be gracious to you. And therefore he will be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you, for Jehovah is a God of justice. Blessed are all those who wait for him.
\[19]For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem. Thou shall weep no more. He will surely be gracious to thee at the voice of thy cry. When he shall hear, he will answer thee.
\[20]And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet thy teachers shall not be hidden anymore, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers.
\[21]And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
\[22]And ye shall defile the overlaying of thy graven images of silver, and the plating of thy molten images of gold. Thou shall cast them away as an unclean thing. Thou shall say to it, Get thee away.
\[23]And he will give the rain for thy seed, with which thou shall sow the ground, and bread of the increase of the ground, and it shall be fat and plenteous. In that day thy cattle shall feed in large pastures.
\[24]Likewise the oxen and the young donkeys that till the ground shall eat savory provender, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.
\[25]And there shall be upon every lofty mountain, and upon every high hill, brooks and streams of waters, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
\[26]Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah binds up the hurt of his people, and heals the stroke of their wound.
\[27]Behold, the name of Jehovah comes from far, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke. His lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire,
\[28]and his breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction. And a bridle that causes to err shall be in the jaws of the peoples.
\[29]Ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept, and gladness of heart, as he who goes with a pipe to come to the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.
\[30]And Jehovah will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show the coming down of his arm with the indignation of his anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast and tempest and hailstones.
\[31]For through the voice of Jehovah the Assyrian shall be dismayed. With his rod he will smite him.
\[32]And every stroke of the appointed staff, which Jehovah shall lay upon him, shall be with the sound of tambourine and harps. And he will fight with them in battles with the brandishing of his arm.
\[33]For a Topheth is prepared of old, yea, it is made ready for the king. He has made it deep and large. The pile of it is fire and much wood. The breath of Jehovah kindles it, like a stream of brimstone.

\[2]Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of those who work iniquity.
\[3]Now the Egyptians are men, and not God, and their horses flesh, and not spirit. And when Jehovah shall stretch out his hand, both he who helps shall stumble, and he who is helped shall fall, and they shall all be consumed together.
\[4]For thus says Jehovah to me, As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey, even if a multitude of shepherds are called forth against him, he will not be dismayed at their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them, so Jehovah of hosts will come down to fight upon mount Zion, and upon the hill of it.
\[5]As birds hovering, so Jehovah of hosts will protect Jerusalem. He will protect and deliver. He will pass over and preserve.
\[6]Turn ye to him from whom ye have deeply revolted, O sons of Israel.
\[7]For in that day they shall cast away every man his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made to you for a sin.
\[8]And the Assyrian shall fall by the sword, not of man, and the sword, not of men, shall devour him. But he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become subject to task work.

ow it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
\[2]And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.
\[3]Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah came forth to him, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder.
\[4]And Rabshakeh said to them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: What confidence is this in which thou trust?
\[5]I say, thy counsel and strength for the war are but vain words. Now on whom do thou trust that thou have rebelled against me?
\[6]Behold, thou trust upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand, and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him.
\[7]But if thou say to me, We trust in Jehovah our God. Is that not he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?
\[8]Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
\[9]How then can thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
\[10]And have I now come up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
\[11]Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it. And speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people who are on the wall.
\[12]But Rabshakeh said, Has my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words, and not to the men who sit upon the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own urine with you?
\[13]Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
\[14]Thus says the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you.
\[15]Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us. This city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[16]Hearken not to Hezekiah. For thus says the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me, and eat ye everyone of his vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and drink ye everyone the waters of his own cistern,
\[17]until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
\[18]Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\[19]Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
\[20]Who are they among all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
\[21]But they held their peace, and answered him not a word. For the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
\[22]Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah came, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

nd it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.
\[2]And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
\[3]And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy, for the sons have come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
\[4]It may be Jehovah thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God has heard. Therefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.
\[5]So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
\[6]And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus says Jehovah: Be not afraid of the words that thou have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
\[7]Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear news, and shall return to his own land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
\[8]So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
\[9]And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He has come out to fight against thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
\[10]Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trust deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[11]Behold, thou have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. And shall thou be delivered?
\[12]Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?
\[13]Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?
\[14]And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it. And Hezekiah went up to the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.
\[15]And Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah, saying,
\[16]O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, who sit above the cherubim, thou are the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. Thou have made heaven and earth.
\[17]Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear. Open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see, and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy the living God.
\[18]Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries, and their land,
\[19]and have cast their gods into the fire. For they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they have destroyed them.
\[20]Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou are Jehovah, even thou only.
\[21]Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Whereas thou have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,
\[22]this is the word which Jehovah has spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised thee and laughed thee to scorn. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at thee.
\[23]Whom have thou defied and blasphemed? And against whom have thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? Even against the Holy One of Israel.
\[24]By thy servants thou have defied the Lord, and have said, With the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon. And I will cut down the tall cedars of it, and the choice fir trees of it, and I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field.
\[25]I have dug and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt.
\[26]Have thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
\[27]Therefore their inhabitants were of small power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb. As the grass on the housetops, and as a field of grain before it is grown up.
\[28]But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.
\[29]Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou came.
\[30]And this shall be the sign to thee. Ye shall eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs of the same, and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of it.
\[31]And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
\[32]For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion those who shall escape. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.
\[33]Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there. Neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.
\[34]By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come to this city, says Jehovah.
\[35]For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\[36]And the agent of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand. And when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
\[37]So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
\[38]And it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword, and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.

\[2]Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Jehovah,
\[3]and said, Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept greatly.
\[4]Then the word of Jehovah came to Isaiah, saying,
\[5]Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus says Jehovah, the God of David thy father. I have heard thy prayer. I have seen thy tears. Behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years.
\[6]And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.

\[9]The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:
\[10]I said, In the noontide of my days I shall go into the gates of Sheol. I am deprived of the residue of my years.
\[11]I said, I shall not see Jehovah, even Jehovah in the land of the living. I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
\[12]My dwelling is removed, and is carried away from me as a shepherd's tent. I have rolled up, like a weaver, my life. He will cut me off from the loom. From day even to night thou will make an end of me.
\[13]I quieted myself until morning. As a lion, so he breaks all my bones. From day even to night will thou make an end of me.
\[14]Like a swallow or a crane, so I chattered. I moaned as a dove. My eyes fail with looking upward. O Lord, I am oppressed, be thou my surety.
\[15]What shall I say? He has both spoken to me, and himself has done it. I shall go softly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.
\[16]O Lord, by these things men live, and wholly therein is the life of my spirit. Therefore recover thou me, and make me to live.
\[17]Behold, for peace I had great bitterness. But thou have by love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption. For thou have cast all my sins behind thy back.
\[18]For Sheol cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee. Those who go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
\[19]The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day. The father to the sons shall make known thy truth.
\[20]Jehovah is ready to save me. Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of Jehovah.
\[21]Now Isaiah had said, Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover.

\[2]And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not show them.
\[3]Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What did these men say? And from where did they come to thee? And Hezekiah said, They have come from a far country to me, even from Babylon.
\[4]Then he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.
\[5]Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts:
\[6]Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, says Jehovah.
\[7]And of thy sons who shall issue from thee, whom thou shall beget, they shall take away, and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
\[8]Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, The word of Jehovah which thou have spoken is good. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.

omfort ye, comfort ye my people, says your God.
\[2]Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry to her, that her warfare has been completed, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received of Jehovah's hand double for all her sins.
\[3]The voice of a man crying out in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
\[4]Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low. And the crooked shall become straight, and the rough places smooth.
\[5]And the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken it.
\[6]The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness of it is as the flower of the field.
\[7]The grass withers, the flower fades, because the breath of Jehovah blows upon it. Surely the people is grass.
\[8]The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God shall stand forever.
\[9]O thou who tell good news to Zion, get thee up on a high mountain. O thou who tell good news to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength. Lift it up, be not afraid, say to the cities of Judah, Behold, your God!
\[10]Behold, the lord Jehovah will come as a mighty one, and his arm will rule for him. Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.
\[11]He will feed his flock like a shepherd. He will gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and will gently lead those who have their young.
\[12]Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
\[13]Who has known the mind of Jehovah, or being his counselor has taught him?
\[14]With whom did he take counsel. And who instructed him, and taught him in the path of justice. And taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?
\[15]Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are accounted as the small dust of the balance. Behold, he takes up the isles as a very little thing.
\[16]And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts of it sufficient for a burnt offering.
\[17]All the nations are as nothing before him. They are accounted by him as less than nothing, and vanity.
\[18]To whom then will ye liken God? Or what likeness will ye compare to him?
\[19]The image, a workman has cast it, and the goldsmith overlays it with gold, and casts for it silver chains.
\[20]He who is too impoverished for such an oblation chooses a tree that will not rot. He seeks for him a skilful workman to set up a graven image that shall not be moved.
\[21]Have ye not known? Have yet not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?
\[22]It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers, who stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in,
\[23]who brings rulers to nothing, who makes the judges of the earth as vanity.
\[24]Yea, they have not been planted. Yea, they have not been sown. Yea, their stock has not taken root in the earth. Moreover he blows upon them, and they wither, and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble.
\[25]To whom then will ye liken me, that I should be equal to him? says the Holy One.
\[26]Lift up your eyes on high, and see who has created these, who brings out their host by number. He calls them all by name, by the greatness of his might. And because he is strong in power, not one is lacking.
\[27]Why do thou say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, My way is hid from Jehovah. And the justice due to me is passed away from my God?
\[28]Have thou not known? Have thou not heard? The everlasting God, Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, faints not, nor is weary. There is no searching of his understanding.
\[29]He gives power to the faint. And to him who has no might he increases strength.
\[30]Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall.
\[31]But those who wait for Jehovah shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles. They shall run, and not be weary. They shall walk, and not faint.

eep silence before me, O islands, and let the peoples renew their strength. Let them come near, then let them speak. Let us come near together to judgment.
\[2]Who raised up the righteous man from the east, calls him to his foot, gives nations before him, and makes him rule over kings? He gives them as the dust to his sword, as the driven stubble to his bow.
\[3]He pursues them, and passes on safely, even by a way that he had not gone with his feet.
\[4]Who has wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I, Jehovah, the first, and with the last, I am he.
\[5]The isles have seen, and fear. The ends of the earth tremble, they draw near, and come.
\[6]They help every man his neighbor, and says to his brother, Be of good courage.
\[7]So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith, he who smoothes with the hammer, him who smites the anvil, saying of the soldering, It is good, and he fastens it with nails, that it should not be moved.
\[8]But thou, Israel, my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend,
\[9]thou whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and called from the corners thereof, and said to thee, Thou are my servant, I have chosen thee and not cast thee away.
\[10]Fear thou not, for I am with thee. Be not dismayed, for I am thy God. I will strengthen thee. Yea, I will help thee. Yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.
\[11]Behold, all those who are incensed against thee shall be put to shame and confounded. Those who strive with thee shall be as nothing, and shall perish.
\[12]Thou shall seek them, and shall not find them, even those who contend with thee. Those who war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of naught.
\[13]For I, Jehovah thy God, will hold thy right hand, saying to thee, Fear not, I will help thee.
\[14]Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel. I will help thee, says Jehovah, and thy Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.
\[15]Behold, I have made thee as a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth. Thou shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make the hills as chaff.
\[16]Thou shall winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them. And thou shall rejoice in Jehovah. Thou shall glory in the Holy One of Israel.
\[17]The poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue fails for thirst. I, Jehovah, will answer them. I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.
\[18]I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys. I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.
\[19]I will put in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, and the myrtle, and the oil tree. I will set in the desert the fir tree, the pine, and the box tree together,
\[20]that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of Jehovah has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created it.
\[21]Produce your case, says Jehovah. Bring forth your strong reasons, says the King of Jacob.
\[22]Let them bring forth, and declare to us what shall happen. Declare ye the former things, what they are, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them, or show us things to come.
\[23]Declare the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods. Yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.
\[24]Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work is of naught. An abomination is he who chooses you.
\[25]I have raised up him from the north, and he has come, him who calls upon my name from the rising of the sun. And he shall come upon rulers as upon mortar, and as the potter treads clay.
\[26]Who has declared it from the beginning, that we may know, and beforetime, that we may say, He is right? Yea, there is none who declares. Yea, there is none who shows. Yea, there is none who hears your words.
\[27]First to Zion. Behold, behold them, and I will give to Jerusalem him who brings good news.
\[28]And when I look, there is no man. Even among them there is no counselor, that, when I ask of them, can answer a word.
\[29]Behold, all of them, their works are vanity and nothing. Their molten images are wind and confusion.

ehold, my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights. I have put my Spirit upon him, he will bring forth justice to the Gentiles.
\[2]He will not cry, nor lift up his voice, nor cause it to be heard in the street.
\[3]A bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench, but he will bring forth justice in truth.
\[4]He will not fail nor be discouraged till he has set justice in the earth. And in his name Gentiles will hope.
\[5]Thus says God, Jehovah, he who created the heavens, and stretched them forth, he who spread abroad the earth and that which comes out of it, he who gives breath to the people upon it, and spirit to those who walk in it,
\[6]I, Jehovah, have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thy hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles,
\[7]to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, and those who sit in darkness out of the prison-house.
\[8]I am Jehovah. That is my name, and I will not give my glory to another, nor my praise to graven images.
\[9]Behold, the former things have come to pass, and I declare new things. Before they spring forth I tell you of them.
\[10]Sing to Jehovah a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye who go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.
\[11]Let the wilderness and the cities of it lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits. Let the inhabitants of Sela sing. Let them shout from the top of the mountains.
\[12]Let them give glory to Jehovah, and declare his praise in the islands.
\[13]Jehovah will go forth as a mighty man. He will stir up his zeal like a man of war. He will cry, yea, he will shout aloud. He will do mightily against his enemies.
\[14]I have for a long time held my peace. I have been still, and refrained myself. Now I will cry out like a travailing woman. I will gasp and pant together.
\[15]I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs. And I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools.
\[16]And I will bring the blind by a way that they know not. I will lead them in paths that they know not. I will make darkness light before them, and crooked places straight. These things I will do, and I will not forsake them.
\[17]They shall be turned back, they shall be utterly put to shame, who trust in graven images, who say to molten images, Ye are our gods.
\[18]Hear, ye deaf, and look, ye blind, that ye may see.
\[19]Who is blind, but my servant, or deaf, as my messenger that I send? Who is blind as he who is at peace with me, and blind as Jehovah's servant?
\[20]Thou see many things, but thou do not observe. His ears are open, but he does not hear.
\[21]It pleased Jehovah, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify the law, and make it honorable.
\[22]But this is a people robbed and plundered. They are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison-houses. They are for a prey, and none delivers, for a spoil, and none says, Restore.
\[23]Who is there among you that will give ear to this, that will hearken and hear for the time to come?
\[24]Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? Did not Jehovah? He against whom we have sinned, and in whose ways they would not walk, nor were they obedient to his law.
\[25]Therefore he poured upon him the fierceness of his anger, and the strength of battle. And it set him on fire round about, yet he knew not. And it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.

ut now thus says Jehovah who created thee, O Jacob, and he who formed thee, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed thee. I have called thee by thy name, Thou are mine.
\[2]When thou pass through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee. When thou walk through the fire, thou shall not be burned, nor shall the flame kindle upon thee.
\[3]For I am Jehovah thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Savior. I have given Egypt as thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in thy stead.
\[4]Since thou have been precious in my sight, and honorable, and I have loved thee, therefore I will give men in thy stead, and peoples instead of thy life.
\[5]Fear not, for I am with thee. I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west.
\[6]I will say to the north, Give up, and to the south, Keep not back. Bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth,
\[7]everyone who is called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory, whom I have formed, yea, whom I have made.
\[8]Bring forth the blind people who have eyes, and the deaf who have ears.
\[9]Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples be assembled. Who among them can declare this, and show us former things? Let them bring their witnesses that they may be justified, or let them hear, and say, It is truth.
\[10]Ye are my witnesses, says Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen, that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he. Before me there was no God formed, nor shall there be after me.
\[11]I, even I, am Jehovah, and besides me there is no savior.
\[12]I have declared, and I have saved, and I have shown, and there was no strange god among you. Therefore ye are my witnesses, says Jehovah, and I am God.
\[13]Yea, since the day was I am he, and there is none that can deliver out of my hand. I will work, and who can hinder it?
\[14]Thus says Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring down all of them as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships of their rejoicing.
\[15]I am Jehovah, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.
\[16]Thus says Jehovah, who makes a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters,
\[17]who brings forth the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty man (they lie down together; they shall not rise; they are extinct; they are quenched as a wick):
\[18]Do not remember ye the former things, nor consider the things of old.
\[19]Behold, I will do a new thing. Now it shall spring forth. Shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.
\[20]The beasts of the field shall honor me, the jackals and the ostriches, because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen,
\[21]the people whom I formed for myself, that they might set forth my praise.
\[22]Yet thou have not called upon me, O Jacob, but thou have been weary of me, O Israel.
\[23]Thou have not brought me from thy sheep for burnt offerings, nor have thou honored me with thy sacrifices. I have not burdened thee with offerings, nor wearied thee with frankincense.
\[24]Thou have bought me no sweet cane with money, nor have thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices. But thou have burdened me with thy sins. Thou have wearied me with thine iniquities.
\[25]I, even I, am he who blots out thy transgressions for my own sake, and I will not remember thy sins.
\[26]Put me in remembrance. Let us plead together. Set thou forth thy case that thou may be justified.
\[27]Thy first father sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.
\[28]Therefore I will profane the rulers of the sanctuary, and I will make Jacob a curse, and Israel a reviling.

\[3]For I will pour water upon him who is thirsty, and streams upon the dry ground. I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring.
\[4]And they shall spring up among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.
\[5]One shall say, I am Jehovah's, and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob, and another shall subscribe with his hand to Jehovah, and surname himself by the name of Israel.
\[6]Thus says Jehovah, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts: I am the first, and I am the last, and besides me there is no God.
\[7]And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I established the ancient people? And let them declare the things that are coming, and that shall come to pass.
\[8]Fear ye not, nor be afraid. Have I not declared to thee of old, and shown it? And ye are my witnesses. Is there a God besides me? Yea, there is no Rock. I know not any.
\[9]Those who fashion a graven image are all of them vanity. And the things that they delight in shall not profit. And their own witnesses see not, nor know, that they may be put to shame.
\[10]Who has fashioned a god, or molded an image that is profitable for nothing?
\[11]Behold, all his fellows shall be put to shame, and the workmen. They are of men. Let them all be gathered together. Let them stand up. They shall fear. They shall be put to shame together.
\[12]The smith makes an axe, and works in the coals, and fashions it with hammers, and works it with his strong arm. Yea, he is hungry, and his strength fails. He drinks no water, and is faint.
\[13]The carpenter stretches out a line. He marks it out with a pencil. He shapes it with planes. And he marks it out with the compasses, and shapes it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man, to dwell in a house.
\[14]He hews down cedars for him, and takes the holm tree and the oak, and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest. He plants a fir tree, and the rain nourishes it.
\[15]Then it shall be for a man to burn. And he takes of it, and warms himself. Yea, he kindles it, and bakes bread. Yea, he makes a god, and worships it. He makes it a graven image, and falls down to it.
\[16]He burns part of it in the fire. With part of it he eats flesh. He roasts roast, and is satisfied. Yea, he warms himself, and says, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire.
\[17]And the residue of it he makes a god, even his graven image. He falls down to it and worships, and prays to it, and says, Deliver me, for thou are my god.
\[18]They do not know, nor do they consider. For he has shut their eyes, that they cannot see, and their hearts, that they cannot understand.
\[19]And none calls to mind, nor is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire. Yea, I have also baked bread upon the coals of it. I have roasted flesh and eaten it. And shall I make the residue of it an abomination? Shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?
\[20]He feeds on ashes. A deceived heart has turned him aside. And he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?
\[21]Remember these things, O Jacob, and Israel, for thou are my servant. I have formed thee. Thou are my servant, O Israel, thou shall not be forgotten by me.
\[22]I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins. Return to me, for I have redeemed thee.
\[23]Sing, O ye heavens, for Jehovah has done it. Shout, ye lower parts of the earth. Break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein. For Jehovah has redeemed Jacob, and will glorify himself in Israel.
\[24]Thus says Jehovah, thy Redeemer, and he who formed thee from the womb: I am Jehovah, who makes all things, who stretches forth the heavens alone, who spreads abroad the earth (who is with me?),
\[25]who frustrates the signs of the liars, and makes diviners mad, who turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish,
\[26]who confirms the word of his servant, and performs the counsel of his messengers, who says of Jerusalem, She shall be inhabited, and of the cities of Judah, They shall be built, and I will raise up the waste places of it,
\[27]who says to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers,

\[10]Woe to him who says to a father, What are thou begetting? or to a woman, With what are thou travailing?
\[11]Thus says Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel and his maker: Ask me of the things that are to come concerning my sons. And command ye me concerning the work of my hands.
\[12]I have made the earth, and created man upon it. I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host I have commanded.
\[13]I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways. He shall build my city, and he shall let my exiles go free, not for price nor reward, says Jehovah of hosts.
\[14]Thus says Jehovah: The labor of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to thee, and they shall be thine. They shall go after thee. In chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down to thee. They shall make supplication to thee, saying, Surely God is in thee, and there is none else, no God.
\[15]Verily thou are a God who hides thyself, O God of Israel, the Savior.
\[16]They shall be put to shame, yea, confounded, all of them. They shall go into confusion together who are makers of idols.
\[17]But Israel shall be saved by Jehovah with an everlasting salvation. Ye shall not be put to shame nor confounded world without end.
\[18]For thus says Jehovah who created the heavens, the God who formed the earth and made it, who established it and did not create it a waste, who formed it to be inhabited: I am Jehovah, and there is none else.
\[19]I have not spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness. I did not say to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain. I, Jehovah, speak righteousness. I declare things that are right.
\[20]Assemble yourselves and come, draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations. They have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray to a god that cannot save.
\[21]Declare ye, and bring it forth. Yea, let them take counsel together. Who has shown this from ancient time? Who has declared it of old? Have not I, Jehovah? And there is no other God besides me, a just God and a Savior. There is none besides me.
\[22]Look to me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God, and there is none else.
\[23]By myself I have sworn, the word has gone forth from my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, that to me every knee shall bow, every tongue will confess to God.
\[24]Only in Jehovah, it is said of me, is righteousness and strength. Even to him men shall come, and all those who were incensed against him shall be put to shame.
\[25]In Jehovah all the seed of Israel shall be justified, and shall glory.

\[11]Therefore evil shall come upon thee. Thou shall not know the dawning of it. And mischief shall fall upon thee. Thou shall not be able to put it away. And desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou know not.
\[12]Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, in which thou have labored from thy youth, if so be thou shall be able to profit, if so be thou may prevail.
\[13]Thou are wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from the things that shall come upon thee.
\[14]Behold, they shall be as stubble. The fire shall burn them. They shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame. It shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before.

ear ye this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and have come forth out of the waters of Judah, who swear by the name of Jehovah, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness
\[2](for they call themselves of the holy city, and steady themselves upon the God of Israel, Jehovah of hosts is his name):
\[3]I have declared the former things from of old. Yea, they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them. Suddenly I did them, and they came to pass.
\[4]Because I knew that thou are obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass,
\[5]therefore I have declared it to thee from of old. Before it came to pass I showed it to thee, lest thou should say, My idol has done them. And my graven image, and my molten image, has commanded them.
\[6]Thou have heard it, behold all this, and ye, will ye not declare it? I have shown thee new things from this time, even hidden things, which thou have not known.
\[7]They are created now, and not from of old. And thou have not heard them before this day, lest thou should say, Behold, I knew them.
\[8]Yea, thou heard not. Yea, thou knew not. Yea, from of old thine ear was not opened. For I knew that thou dealt very treacherously, and were called a transgressor from the womb.
\[9]For my name's sake I will defer my anger, and for my praise I will refrain for thee, that I not cut thee off.
\[10]Behold, I have refined thee, but not as silver. I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.
\[11]For my own sake, for my own sake, I will do it. For how should my name be profaned? And I will not give my glory to another.
\[12]Hearken to me, O Jacob, and Israel my called: I am he. I am the first. I also am the last.
\[13]Yea, my hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand has spread out the heavens. When I call to them, they stand up together.
\[14]Assemble yourselves, all ye, and hear: Who among them has declared these things? He whom Jehovah loves shall perform his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm, the Chaldeans.
\[15]I, even I, have spoken, yea, I have called him. I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.
\[16]Come ye near to me, hear ye this: From the beginning I have not spoken in secret. From the time that it was, there I am. And now the lord Jehovah and his Spirit has sent me.
\[17]Thus says Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am Jehovah thy God, who teaches thee to profit, who leads thee by the way that thou should go.
\[18]Oh that thou had hearkened to my commandments! Then thy peace would have been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea.
\[19]Thy seed also would have been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the grains of it. His name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.
\[20]Go ye forth from Babylon. Flee ye from the Chaldeans. With a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth. Say ye, Jehovah has redeemed his servant Jacob.
\[21]And they did not thirst when he led them through the deserts. He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them. He also split the rock, and the waters gushed out.
\[22]There is no peace, says Jehovah, to the wicked.

isten, O isles, to me, and hearken, ye peoples from far. Jehovah has called me from the womb. From the bowels of my mother he has made mention of my name.
\[2]And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword. He has hid me in the shadow of his hand, and he has made me a polished shaft. He has kept me close in his quiver.
\[3]And he said to me, Thou are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.
\[4]But I said, I have labored in vain. I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity. Yet surely the justice due to me is with Jehovah, and my recompense with my God.
\[5]And now says Jehovah who formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, and that Israel be gathered to him (for I am honorable in the eyes of Jehovah, and my God has become my strength),
\[6]yea, he says, It is too light a thing that thou should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel. I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou may be my salvation to the end of the earth.
\[7]Thus says Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers. Kings shall see and arise, rulers, and they shall worship, because of Jehovah who is faithful, even the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen thee.
\[8]Thus says Jehovah, In an acceptable time I have heard thee, and in a day of salvation I have helped thee. And I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritages,
\[9]saying to those who are bound, Go forth; to those who are in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pasture shall be on all bare heights.
\[10]They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor sun smite them. For he who has mercy on them will lead them. He will guide them even by springs of water.
\[11]And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.
\[12]Lo, these shall come from far, and, lo, these from the north and from the west, and these from the land of Sinim.
\[13]Sing, O heavens, and be joyful, O earth, and break forth into singing, O mountains. For Jehovah has comforted his people, and will have compassion upon his afflicted.
\[14]But Zion said, Jehovah has forsaken me, and the Lord has forgotten me.
\[15]Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, these may forget, yet I will not forget thee.
\[16]Behold, I have engraved thee upon the palms of my hands. Thy walls are continually before me.
\[17]Thy sons make haste. Thy destroyers and those who made thee waste shall go forth from thee.
\[18]Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold. All these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, says Jehovah, thou shall surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and gird thyself with them, like a bride.
\[19]For, as for thy waste and thy desolate places, and thy land that has been destroyed, surely now thou shall be too narrow for the inhabitants, and those who swallowed thee up shall be far away.
\[20]The sons of thy bereavement shall yet say in thine ears, The place is too narrow for me. Give a place to me that I may dwell.
\[21]Then thou shall say in thy heart, Who has begotten these for me, seeing I have been bereaved of my sons, and am solitary, an exile, and wandering to and fro? And who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone, these, where were they?
\[22]Thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and set up my ensign to the peoples. And they shall bring thy sons in their bosom, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.
\[23]And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers. They shall bow down to thee with their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of thy feet. And thou shall know that I am Jehovah, and those who wait for me shall not be put to shame.
\[24]Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives be delivered?
\[25]But thus says Jehovah, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered. For I will contend with him who contends with thee, and I will save thy sons.
\[26]And I will feed those who oppress thee with their own flesh. And they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine. And all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, am thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

\[2]Why, when I came, was there no man? When I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea. I make the rivers a wilderness. Their fish stink because there is no water, and die for thirst.
\[3]I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.
\[4]The lord Jehovah has given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary. He awakens morning by morning. He awakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.
\[5]The lord Jehovah has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, nor turned away backward.
\[6]I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair. I did not hide my face from shame and spitting.
\[7]For the lord Jehovah will help me. Therefore I have not been confounded. Therefore I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame.

\[9]Behold, the lord Jehovah will help me. Who is he who shall condemn me? Behold, all they shall grow old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.
\[10]Who is among you that fears Jehovah, who obeys the voice of his servant? He who walks in darkness, and has no light, let him trust in the name of Jehovah, and rely upon his God.

\[2]Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who bore you. For when he was but one I called him, and I blessed him, and made him many.
\[3]For Jehovah has comforted Zion. He has comforted all her waste places, and has made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of Jehovah. Joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.
\[4]Attend to me, O my people, and give ear to me, O my nation. For a law shall go forth from me, and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples.
\[5]My righteousness is near. My salvation has gone forth, and my arms shall judge the peoples. The isles shall wait for me, and on my arm they shall trust.
\[6]Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath. For the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall grow old like a garment, and those who dwell in it shall die in like manner. But my salvation shall be forever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
\[7]Hearken to me, ye who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law. Fear ye not the reproach of men, nor be ye dismayed at their revilings.
\[8]For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool. But my righteousness shall be forever, and my salvation to all generations.
\[9]Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of Jehovah. Awake, as in the days of old, the generations of ancient times. Is it not thou who cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the monster?
\[10]Is it not thou who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?
\[11]And the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come with singing to Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads. They shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
\[12]I, even I, am he who comforts you. Who are thou, that thou are afraid of man who shall die, and of the son of man who shall be made as grass,
\[13]and have forgotten Jehovah thy maker, who stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth, and fear continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor, when he makes ready to destroy? And where is the fury of the oppressor?
\[14]The captive exile shall speedily be loosed, and he shall not die in the pit, nor shall his bread fail.
\[15]For I am Jehovah thy God, who stirs up the sea so that the waves of it roar. Jehovah of hosts is his name.
\[16]And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, Thou are my people.
\[17]Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, who have drunk at the hand of Jehovah the cup of his wrath. Thou have drunk the bowl of the cup of staggering, and drained it.
\[18]There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth, nor is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons that she has brought up.
\[19]These two things have befallen thee (Who shall bemoan thee?): Desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword. How shall I comfort thee?

\[2]For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground. He has no form nor comeliness. And when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
\[3]He was despised, and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. And as him from whom men hide their face he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
\[4]Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows. Yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.
\[5]But he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed.
\[6]All we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned every one to his own way, and Jehovah has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
\[7]He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he opened not his mouth. As a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that is mute before its shearers, so he opened not his mouth.
\[8]In his humiliation his justice was taken away. And as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke was due?
\[9]And they made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in his death. Although he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.
\[10]Yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise him. He has put him to grief. When thou shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed. He shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand.
\[11]He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied. By the knowledge of himself shall my righteous servant justify many, and he shall bear their iniquities.
\[12]Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he poured out his soul to death, and was numbered with the transgressors. Yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

\[12]And I will make thy pinnacles of rubies, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy border of precious stones.
\[13]And all thy sons shall be taught of Jehovah, and great shall be the peace of thy sons.
\[14]Thou shall be established in righteousness. Thou shall be far from oppression, for thou shall not fear, and from terror, for it shall not come near thee.

\[16]Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals, and brings forth a weapon for his work. And I have created the waster to destroy.

\[7]Is it not to deal thy bread to a hungry man, and that thou bring the poor who are cast out to thy house, when thou see a naked man, that thou cover him, and that thou not hide thyself from thine own flesh?
\[8]Then thy light shall break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily. And thy righteousness shall go before thee. The glory of Jehovah shall be thy rearward.
\[9]Then thou shall call, and Jehovah will answer, thou shall cry, and he will say, Here I am. If thou take the yoke away from the midst of thee, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly,
\[10]and if thou draw out thy soul to a hungry man, and satisfy an afflicted soul, then thy light shall rise in darkness, and thine obscurity be as the noonday.
\[11]And Jehovah will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in dry places, and make strong thy bones. And thou shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water whose waters fail not.
\[12]And those who shall be of thee shall build the old waste places. Thou shall raise up the foundations of many generations, and thou shall be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.
\[13]If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day, and call the sabbath a delight, and the holy of Jehovah honorable, and shall honor it, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:
\[14]then thou shall delight thyself in Jehovah, and I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father. For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken it.

ehold, Jehovah's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save, nor his ear heavy, that it cannot hear.
\[2]But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you so that he will not hear.
\[3]For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity. Your lips have spoken lies. Your tongue mutters wickedness.
\[4]No man sues in righteousness, and no man pleads in truth. They trust in vanity, and speak lies. They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.
\[5]They hatch adders' eggs, and weave the spider's web. He who eats of their eggs dies, and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.
\[6]Their webs shall not become garments, nor shall they cover themselves with their works. Their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.
\[7]Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity. Desolation and destruction are in their paths.
\[8]They do not know the way of peace, and there is no justice in their goings. They have made them crooked paths. Whoever goes in it does not know peace.
\[9]Therefore justice is far from us, nor does righteousness overtake us. We look for light, but behold, darkness, for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.
\[10]We grope for the wall like the blind. Yea, we grope as those who have no eyes. We stumble at noonday as in the twilight. We are as dead men in desolate places.
\[11]We all roar like bears, and moan greatly like doves. We look for justice, but there is none, for salvation, but it is far off from us.
\[12]For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us. For our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:
\[13]transgressing and denying Jehovah, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
\[14]And justice is turned away backward, and righteousness stands afar off. For truth has fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.
\[15]Yea, truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. And Jehovah saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.
\[16]And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor. Therefore his own arm brought salvation to him. And his righteousness, it upheld him.
\[17]And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head. And he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.
\[18]According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies. He will repay recompense to the islands.
\[19]So they shall fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. For he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Jehovah drives.
\[20]And he who redeems will come to Zion, and to those who turn from transgression in Jacob, says Jehovah.
\[21]And as for me, this is my covenant with them, says Jehovah: My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, says Jehovah, from henceforth and forever.

\[12]For that nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish. Yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.
\[13]The glory of Lebanon shall come to thee, the fir tree, the pine, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary. And I will make the place of my feet glorious.
\[14]And the sons of those who afflicted thee shall come bending to thee. And all those who despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet. And they shall call thee The city of Jehovah, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
\[15]Whereas thou have been forsaken and hated, so that no man passed through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.
\[16]Thou shall also suck the milk of the nations, and shall suck the breast of kings. And thou shall know that I, Jehovah, am thy Savior, and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
\[17]For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron. I will also make thy officers peace, and thine overseers righteousness.
\[18]Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, desolation nor destruction within thy borders, but thou shall call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.
\[19]The sun shall no more be thy light by day, nor for brightness shall the moon give light to thee, but Jehovah will be to thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.
\[20]Thy sun shall no more go down, nor shall thy moon withdraw itself, for Jehovah will be thine everlasting light. And the days of thy mourning shall be ended.
\[21]Thy people also shall all be righteous. They shall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.

\[3]I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the peoples there was no man with me. Yea, I trod them in my anger, and trampled them in my wrath, and their lifeblood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my raiment.
\[4]For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed has come.
\[5]And I looked, and there was none to help. And I wondered that there was none to uphold. Therefore my own arm brought salvation to me. And my wrath, it upheld me.
\[6]And I trod down the peoples in my anger, and made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.
\[7]I will make mention of the loving kindnesses of Jehovah, and the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah has bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he has bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.
\[8]For he said, Surely, they are my people, sons that will not deal falsely. So he was their Savior.
\[9]In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the agent of his presence saved them. In his love and in his pity he redeemed them. And he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.
\[10]But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit. Therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and himself fought against them.

\[2]I have spread out my hands all the day to a disobedient and rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, according to their own thoughts,
\[3]a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks,
\[4]who sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places, who eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels,

\[7]your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says Jehovah, those who have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills. Therefore I will measure their former work into their bosom.
\[8]Thus says Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and a man says, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it, so I will do for my servants' sake, that I may not destroy them all.
\[9]And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains. And my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.
\[10]And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people who have sought me.
\[11]But ye who forsake Jehovah, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up mingled wine to Destiny,
\[12]I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter. Because when I called, ye did not answer, when I spoke, ye did not hear, but ye did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight.
\[13]Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry. Behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty. Behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be put to shame.
\[14]Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.
\[15]And ye shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen, and the lord Jehovah will kill thee. And he will call his servants by another name,
\[16]so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth, and he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth. Because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.
\[17]For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
\[18]But be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create. For, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
\[19]And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people. And there shall no more be heard in her the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.
\[20]There shall be no more from there an infant of days, nor an old man who has not filled his days. For the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.
\[21]And they shall build houses, and inhabit them. And they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
\[22]They shall not build, and another inhabit. They shall not plant, and another eat. For as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
\[23]They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity. For they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.
\[24]And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer, and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.

\[14]And ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass. And the hand of Jehovah shall be known toward his servants, and he will have indignation against his enemies.
\[15]For, behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind, to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
\[16]For by fire Jehovah will execute judgment, and by his sword, upon all flesh, and the slain of Jehovah shall be many.
\[17]Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go to the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together, says Jehovah.
\[18]For I know their works and their thoughts. The time comes, that I will gather all nations and tongues, and they shall come, and shall see my glory.
\[19]And I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, who have not heard my fame, nor have seen my glory, and they shall declare my glory among the nations.
\[20]And they shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an oblation to Jehovah, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says Jehovah, as the sons of Israel bring their oblation in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah.
\[21]And of them also I will take for priests and for Levites, says Jehovah.
\[22]For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says Jehovah, so shall your seed and your name remain.
\[23]And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says Jehovah.
\[24]And they shall go forth, and look upon the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me. For their worm shall not die, nor shall their fire be quenched, and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh.

\[3]It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away captive of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
\[4]Now the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[5]Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee, and before thou came forth out of the womb I sanctified thee. I have appointed thee a prophet to the nations.
\[6]Then I said, Ah, lord Jehovah! Behold, I know not how to speak, for I am a child.
\[7]But Jehovah said to me, Say not, I am a child. For to whomever I shall send thee thou shall go, and whatever I shall command thee thou shall speak.
\[8]Be not afraid because of them, for I am with thee to deliver thee, says Jehovah.
\[9]Then Jehovah put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And Jehovah said to me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.
\[10]See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.
\[11]Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what do thou see? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.
\[12]Then Jehovah said to me, Thou have well seen. For I watch over my word to perform it.
\[13]And the word of Jehovah came to me the second time, saying, What do thou see? And I said, I see a boiling caldron, and the face of it is from the north.
\[14]Then Jehovah said to me, Out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
\[15]For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says Jehovah. And they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls of it round about, and against all the cities of Judah.
\[16]And I will utter my judgments against them concerning all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.
\[17]Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command thee. Be not dismayed at them, lest I dismay thee before them.
\[18]For, behold, I have made thee this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the rulers of it, against the priests of it, and against the people of the land.
\[19]And they shall fight against thee. But they shall not prevail against thee, for I am with thee, says Jehovah, to deliver thee.

\[3]Israel was holiness to Jehovah, the first-fruits of his increase. All who devour him shall be held guilty. Evil shall come upon them, says Jehovah.

\[6]Nor did they say, Where is Jehovah who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none passed through, and where no man dwelt?
\[7]And I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat the fruit of it and the goodness of it. But when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.
\[8]The priests did not say, Where is Jehovah? And those who handle the law did not know me. The rulers also transgressed against me. And the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.

\[12]Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid. Be ye very desolate, says Jehovah.
\[13]For my people have committed two evils: They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
\[14]Is Israel a servant? Is he a homebred one? Why has he become a prey?
\[15]The young lions have roared upon him, and yelled, and they have made his land waste. His cities are burned up, without inhabitant.
\[16]The sons also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of thy head.
\[17]Have thou not procured this to thyself, in that thou have forsaken Jehovah thy God when he led thee by the way?
\[18]And now what have thou to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? Or what have thou to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?
\[19]Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee. Know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter, that thou have forsaken Jehovah thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.
\[20]For from old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bonds. And thou said, I will not serve, for upon every high hill and under every green tree thou bowed thyself, playing the harlot.
\[21]Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed. How then have thou turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me?
\[22]For though thou wash thee with lye, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, says the lord Jehovah.
\[23]How can thou say, I am not defiled; I have not gone after the Baalim? See thy way in the valley. Know what thou have done, a swift dromedary traversing her ways,
\[24]a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that sniffs up the wind in her desire. In her time of estrus who can turn her away? All those who seek her will not weary themselves. In her month they shall find her.
\[25]Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst. But thou said, It is in vain. No, for I have loved strangers, and after them I will go.
\[26]As the thief is shamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel shamed, they, their kings, their rulers, and their priests, and their prophets,
\[27]who say to a block of wood, Thou are my father, and to a stone, Thou have brought me forth. For they have turned their back to me, and not their face. But in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.
\[28]But where are thy gods that thou have made thee? Let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble. For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.
\[29]Why will ye contend with me? Ye have all transgressed against me, says Jehovah.
\[30]In vain I have smitten your sons. They received no correction. Your own sword has devoured your prophets like a destroying lion.
\[31]O generation, see ye the word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, or a land of thick darkness? Why do my people say, We have broken loose. We will come no more to thee?
\[32]Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
\[33]How thou trim thy way to seek love! Therefore even the wicked women thou have taught thy ways.
\[34]Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor. Thou did not find them breaking in. But it is because of all these things.
\[35]Yet thou said, I am innocent. Surely his anger is turned away from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee because thou say, I have not sinned.
\[36]Why do thou gad about so much to change thy way? Thou shall be ashamed of Egypt also, as thou were ashamed of Assyria.
\[37]Thou shall also go forth from there with thy hands upon thy head. For Jehovah has rejected those in whom thou trust. And thou shall not prosper with them.

hey say, If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him, and become another man's, will he return to her again? Will not that land be greatly polluted? But thou have played the harlot with many lovers. Yet return again to me, says Jehovah.
\[2]Lift up thine eyes to the bare heights, and see. Where have thou not been lain with? By the ways thou have sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness, and thou have polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.
\[3]Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain. Yet thou have a harlot's forehead; thou refused to be ashamed.
\[4]Will thou not from this time cry to me, My Father, thou are the guide of my youth?
\[5]Will he retain his anger forever? Will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou have spoken, and have done evil things, and have had thy way.
\[6]Moreover Jehovah said to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have thou seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the harlot.
\[7]And I said after she had done all these things, She will return to me, but she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
\[8]And I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement, yet treacherous Judah her sister feared not, but she also went and played the harlot.
\[9]And it came to pass through the frivolity of her whoredom, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks.
\[10]And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not returned to me with her whole heart, but in pretense, says Jehovah.
\[11]And Jehovah said to me, Backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.
\[12]Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, says Jehovah, I will not look in anger upon you, for I am merciful, says Jehovah. I will not keep anger forever.
\[13]Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou have transgressed against Jehovah thy God, and have scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, says Jehovah.
\[14]Return, O backsliding sons, says Jehovah, for I am a husband to you. And I will take you, one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion.
\[15]And I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
\[16]And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, says Jehovah, they shall no more say, The ark of the covenant of Jehovah, nor shall it come to mind. Neither shall they remember it, nor shall they miss it. Neither shall it be made any more.
\[17]At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah, and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem. Neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
\[18]In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers.
\[19]But I said, How I will put thee among the sons, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of the nations! And I said, Ye shall call me My Father, and shall not turn away from following me.
\[20]Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so ye have dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, says Jehovah.
\[21]A voice is heard upon the bare heights, the weeping and the supplications of the sons of Israel, because they have perverted their way; they have forgotten Jehovah their God.
\[22]Return, ye backsliding sons, I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we have come to thee, for thou are Jehovah our God.
\[23]Truly it is in vain from the heights, the multitude on the mountains. Truly in Jehovah our God is the salvation of Israel.
\[24]But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
\[25]Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us, for we have sinned against Jehovah our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and we have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God.

f thou will return, O Israel, says Jehovah, if thou will return to me, and if thou will put away thine abominations out of my sight, then thou shall not be removed.
\[2]And thou shall swear, As Jehovah lives, in truth, in justice, and in righteousness. And the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him they shall glory.
\[3]For thus says Jehovah to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.
\[4]Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
\[5]Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem, and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land. Cry aloud and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.
\[6]Set up a standard toward Zion. Flee for safety, do not stay. For I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.
\[7]A lion has gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations. He is on his way, he has gone forth from his place, to make thy land desolate, that thy cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.
\[8]For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail, for the fierce anger of Jehovah is not turned back from us.
\[9]And it shall come to pass at that day, says Jehovah, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the rulers, and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.
\[10]Then I said, Ah, lord Jehovah! Surely thou have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace, whereas the sword reaches to the life.
\[11]At that time it shall be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse,
\[12]a full wind from these shall come for me. Now I will also utter judgments against them.
\[13]Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots as the whirlwind. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! For we are ruined.
\[14]O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou may be saved. How long shall thine evil thoughts lodge within thee?
\[15]For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim:
\[16]Make ye mention to the nations. Behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.
\[17]They are as keepers of a field against her round about, because she has been rebellious against me, says Jehovah.
\[18]Thy way and thy doings have procured these things to thee. This is thy wickedness, for it is bitter, for it reaches to thy heart.
\[19]My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart. My heart is disquieted in me. I cannot hold my peace, because thou have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.
\[20]Destruction upon destruction is cried, for the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, and my curtains in a moment.
\[21]How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?
\[22]For my people are foolish. They do not know me. They are sottish sons, and they have no understanding. They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
\[23]I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was waste and void, and the heavens, and they had no light.
\[24]I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved to and fro.
\[25]I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.
\[26]I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of Jehovah, and before his fierce anger.
\[27]For thus says Jehovah: The whole land shall be a desolation, yet I will not make a full end.
\[28]For this the earth shall mourn, and the heavens above be black, because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have not relented, nor will I turn back from it.
\[29]Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen. They go into the thickets, and climb up upon the rocks. Every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells in it.
\[30]And thou, when thou are made desolate, what will thou do? Though thou clothe thyself with scarlet, though thou deck thee with ornaments of gold, though thou enlarge thine eyes with paint, in vain thou make thyself fair. Thy lovers despise thee, they seek thy life.
\[31]For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her who brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps for breath, who spreads her hands, saying, Woe is me now! For my soul faints before the murderers.

un ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places of it, if ye can find a man, if there is any who does justly, who seeks truth, and I will pardon her.
\[2]And though they say, As Jehovah lives, surely they swear falsely.
\[3]O Jehovah, do not thine eyes look upon truth? Thou have stricken them, but they were not grieved. Thou have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction. They have made their faces harder than a rock. They have refused to return.
\[4]Then I said, Surely these are poor, they are foolish, for they know not the way of Jehovah, nor the law of their God.
\[5]I will go to the great men, and will speak to them, for they know the way of Jehovah, and the law of their God. But these with one accord have broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.
\[6]Therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them; a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them; a leopard shall watch against their cities. Everyone who goes out from there shall be torn in pieces, because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.
\[7]How can I pardon thee? Thy sons have forsaken me, and sworn by those who are no gods. When I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the harlots' houses.
\[8]They were as fed horses roaming at large; everyone neighed after his neighbor's wife.
\[9]Shall I not visit for these things? says Jehovah. And shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\[10]Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy, but make not a full end. Take away her branches, for they are not Jehovah's.
\[11]For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, says Jehovah.
\[12]They have denied Jehovah, and said, It is not he. Neither shall evil come upon us, nor shall we see sword nor famine.
\[13]And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them. Thus shall it be done to them.
\[14]Therefore thus says Jehovah, the God of hosts: Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
\[15]Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, says Jehovah. It is a mighty nation. It is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou know not, nor understand what they say.
\[16]Their quiver is an open sepulcher. They are all mighty men.
\[17]And they shall eat up thy harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should eat. They shall eat up thy flocks and thy herds. They shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees. They shall beat down thy fortified cities, wherein thou trust, with the sword.
\[18]But even in those days, says Jehovah, I will not make a full end with you.
\[19]And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Why has Jehovah our God done all these things to us? Then thou shall say to them, Just as ye have forsaken me, and served foreign gods in your land, so ye shall serve strangers in a land that is not yours.
\[20]Declare ye this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,
\[21]Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding, who have eyes, and see not, who have ears, and hear not:
\[22]Do ye not fear me? says Jehovah. Will ye not tremble at my presence, who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it? And though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet they cannot prevail, though they roar, yet they cannot pass over it.
\[23]But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart. They have revolted and gone.
\[24]Neither do they say in their heart, Let us now fear Jehovah our God, who gives rain, both the former and the latter, in its season, who preserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
\[25]Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld good from you.
\[26]For among my people are found wicked men. They watch as fowlers lie in wait. They set a trap; they catch men.
\[27]As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit. Therefore they have become great, and grown rich.
\[28]They have grown fat. They shine. Yea, they overflow in deeds of wickedness. They do not plead the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may prosper. And they do not judge the right of the needy.
\[29]Shall I not visit for these things? says Jehovah. Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\[30]An astonishing and horrible thing has come to pass in the land.
\[31]The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means. And my people love to have it so. And what will ye do in the end thereof?

lee for safety, ye sons of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem. And blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth-haccherem. For evil looks forth from the north, and a great destruction.
\[2]The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, I will cut off.
\[3]Shepherds with their flocks shall come to her. They shall pitch their tents against her round about. They shall feed every one in his place.
\[4]Prepare ye war against her. Arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! For the day declines; for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.
\[5]Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
\[6]For thus has Jehovah of hosts said: Hew ye down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem. This is the city to be visited. She has oppression completely in the midst of her.
\[7]As a well casts forth its waters, so she casts forth her wickedness. Violence and destruction is heard in her. Continually before me is sickness and wounds.
\[8]Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from thee, lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.
\[9]Thus says Jehovah of hosts: They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine. Turn again thy hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets.
\[10]To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken. Behold, the word of Jehovah has become to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.
\[11]Therefore I am full of the wrath of Jehovah. I am weary with holding in. Pour it out upon the sons in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together. For even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him who is full of days.
\[12]And their houses shall be turned to others, their fields and their wives together. For I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, says Jehovah.
\[13]For from the least of them even to the greatest of them everyone is given to covetousness. And from the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely.
\[14]They have also lightly healed the hurt of my people, saying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace.
\[15]Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, nor could they blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall. At the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, says Jehovah.
\[16]Thus says Jehovah, Stand ye in the ways and see. And ask for the old paths where is the good way. And walk in it, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk.
\[17]And I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.
\[18]Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.
\[19]Hear, O earth: Behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened to my words. And as for my law, they have rejected it.
\[20]To what purpose does there come to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing to me.
\[21]Therefore thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them. The neighbor and his friend shall perish.
\[22]Thus says Jehovah, Behold, a people comes from the north country, and a great nation shall be stirred up from the outermost parts of the earth.
\[23]They lay hold on bow and spear. They are cruel, and have no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride upon horses. Each one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Zion.
\[24]We have heard the report of it. Our hands grow feeble. Anguish has taken hold of us, and pangs as of a woman in travail.
\[25]Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way, for the sword of the enemy, and terror, are on every side.
\[26]O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes. Make thee mourning, as for an only son, a most bitter lamentation. For the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.
\[27]I have made thee a prover and a fortress among my people, that thou may know and try their way.
\[28]They are all grievous revolters, going about with slanders. They are brass and iron. They all of them deal corruptly.
\[29]The bellows blow fiercely, the lead is consumed of the fire. In vain do they go on refining, for the wicked are not plucked away.

he word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
\[2]Stand in the gate of Jehovah's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of Jehovah, all ye of Judah, who enter in at these gates to worship Jehovah.
\[3]Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
\[4]Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, are these.
\[5]For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor,
\[6]if ye do not oppress the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, nor walk after other gods to your own hurt,
\[7]then I will cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers from of old even for evermore.
\[8]Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.
\[9]Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods that ye have not known,
\[10]and then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered, that ye may do all these abominations?
\[11]Has this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it, says Jehovah.
\[12]But go ye now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.
\[13]And now, because ye have done all these works, says Jehovah. And I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not, and I called you, but ye answered not,
\[14]therefore I will do to the house, which is called by my name, in which ye trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.
\[15]And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, even the whole seed of Ephraim.
\[16]Therefore pray thou not for this people, nor lift up cry nor prayer for them. Neither make intercession to me, for I will not hear thee.
\[17]Do thou not see what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\[18]The sons gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.
\[19]Do they provoke me to anger? says Jehovah, and not themselves, to the confusion of their own faces?
\[20]Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, my anger and my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground. And it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
\[21]Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat ye flesh.
\[22]For I spoke not to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices.
\[23]But this thing I commanded them, saying, Hearken to my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people. And walk ye in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.
\[24]But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in their own counsels, in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.
\[25]Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them.
\[26]Yet they hearkened not to me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff. They did worse than their fathers.
\[27]And thou shall speak all these words to them, but they will not hearken to thee. Thou shall also call to them, but they will not answer thee.
\[28]And thou shall say to them, This is the nation that has not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God, nor received instruction. Truth has perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
\[29]Cut off thy hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights. For Jehovah has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.
\[30]For the sons of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight, says Jehovah. They have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.
\[31]And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, nor did it come into my mind.
\[32]Therefore, behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter. For they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place to bury.
\[33]And the dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth, and none shall frighten them away.
\[34]Then I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, for the land shall become a waste.

They shall not be gathered, nor be buried. They shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.
\[3]And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places where I have driven them, says Jehovah of hosts.
\[4]Moreover thou shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah: Shall men fall, and not rise up again? Shall he turn away, and not return?
\[5]Why then has this people of Jerusalem slid back by a perpetual backsliding? They hold firm deceit. They refuse to return.
\[6]I hearkened and heard, but they did not speak aright. No man repents of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? Everyone turns to his course as a horse that rushes headlong in the battle.
\[7]Yea, the stork in the heavens knows her appointed times, and the turtledove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming, but my people know not the law of Jehovah.
\[8]How can ye say, We are wise, and the law of Jehovah is with us? But behold, the false pen of the scribes has wrought falsely.
\[9]The wise men are put to shame. They are dismayed and taken. Lo, they have rejected the word of Jehovah, and what manner of wisdom is in them?
\[10]Therefore I will give their wives to others, and their fields to those who shall possess them. For everyone from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness. From the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely.
\[11]And they have lightly healed the hurt of the daughter of my people, saying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace.
\[12]Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, nor could they blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall. In the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, says Jehovah.
\[13]I will utterly consume them, says Jehovah. There shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade, and things I have given them shall pass away from them.
\[14]Why do we sit still? Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there. For Jehovah our God has put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against Jehovah.
\[15]We looked for peace, but no good came, for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!
\[16]The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan. At the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembles. For they have come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it, the city and those who dwell therein.
\[17]For, behold, I will send serpents, adders, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, says Jehovah.
\[18]Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow! My heart is faint within me.
\[19]Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land that is very far off: Is not Jehovah in Zion? Is not her King in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with foreign vanities?
\[20]The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
\[21]For the hurt of the daughter of my people I am hurt. I mourn. Dismay has taken hold on me.
\[22]Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?

h that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!
\[2]Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring men, that I might leave my people, and go from them! For they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.
\[3]And they bend their tongue-their bow-for falsehood, and they have grown strong in the land, but not for truth. For they proceed from evil to evil, and they do not know me, says Jehovah.
\[4]Take ye heed each one of his neighbor, and trust ye not in any brother, for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will go about with slanders.
\[5]And they will deceive each one his neighbor, and will not speak the truth. They have taught their tongue to speak lies. They weary themselves to commit iniquity.
\[6]Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit. Through deceit they refuse to know me, says Jehovah.
\[7]Therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will melt them, and try them, for how else should I do, because of the daughter of my people?
\[8]Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceit. He speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he lies wait for him.
\[9]Shall I not visit them for these things? says Jehovah. Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\[10]For the mountains I will take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passes through, nor can men hear the voice of the cattle. Both the birds of the heavens and the beasts have fled; they are gone.
\[11]And I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling-place of jackals. And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.
\[12]Who is the wise man, who may understand this, and he to whom the mouth of Jehovah has spoken, that he may declare it? Why has the land perished and burned up like a wilderness, so that none passes through?
\[13]And Jehovah says, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, nor walked in it,
\[14]but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baalim, which their fathers taught them.
\[15]Therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.
\[16]I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known. And I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them.
\[17]Thus says Jehovah of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come, and send for the skilful women, that they may come.
\[18]And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.
\[19]For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How we are ruined! We are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings.
\[20]Yet hear the word of Jehovah, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and each one her neighbor lamentation.
\[21]For death has come up into our windows. It has entered into our palaces, to cut off the sons from outside, the young men from the streets.
\[22]Speak, Thus says Jehovah: The dead bodies of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather.
\[23]Thus says Jehovah: Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, nor let the mighty man glory in his might. Let not the rich man glory in his riches,
\[24]but let him who boasts boast in this, that he has understanding, and knows me, that I am Jehovah who exercises loving kindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth. For in these things I delight, says Jehovah.
\[25]Behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that I will punish all those who are circumcised in their uncircumcision:
\[26]Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the sons of Ammon, and Moab, and all who have the corners of their hair cut off, who dwell in the wilderness. For all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.

ear ye the word which Jehovah speaks to you, O house of Israel.
\[2]Thus says Jehovah: Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven, for the nations are dismayed at them.
\[3]For the customs of the peoples are vanity. For a man cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe.
\[4]They deck it with silver and with gold. They fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it not move.
\[5]They are like a palm tree, of turned work, and do not speak. They must be carried, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, nor is it in them to do good.
\[6]There is none like thee, O Jehovah. Thou are great, and thy name is great in might.
\[7]Who should not fear thee, O King of the nations? For to thee it appertains, inasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like thee.
\[8]But they are together brutish and foolish, the instruction of idols! It is but a block of wood.
\[9]There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith, blue and purple for their clothing. They are all the work of skilful men.
\[10]But Jehovah is the true God. He is the living God, and an everlasting King. At his wrath the earth trembles, and the nations are not able to abide his indignation.
\[11]Thus ye shall say to them: The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.
\[12]He has made the earth by his power. He has established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding he has stretched out the heavens.
\[13]When he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings for the rain, and brings forth the wind out of his treasuries.
\[14]Every man has become brutish, without knowledge. Every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image. For his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
\[15]They are vanity, a work of delusion. In the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\[16]The portion of Jacob is not like these. For he is the former of all things, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance. Jehovah of hosts is his name.
\[17]Gather up thy wares out of the land, O thou who abides in the siege.
\[18]For thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel it.
\[19]Woe is me because of my hurt! My wound is grievous, but I said, Truly this is my grief, and I must bear it.
\[20]My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken. My sons have gone forth from me, and they are not. There is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
\[21]For the shepherds have become brutish, and have not inquired of Jehovah. Therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.
\[22]The voice of news. Behold, it comes, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.
\[23]O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself. It is not in man who walks to direct his steps.
\[24]O Jehovah, correct me, but in measure, not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.
\[25]Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name. For they have devoured Jacob. Yea, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.

he word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
\[2]Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
\[3]and say thou to them, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man who does not hear the words of this covenant,
\[4]which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you, so ye shall be my people, and I will be your God,
\[5]that I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day. Then I answered, and said, Truly, O Jehovah.
\[6]And Jehovah said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.
\[7]For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.
\[8]Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked each one in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did them not.
\[9]And Jehovah said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[10]They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words, and they have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.
\[11]Therefore thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape. And they shall cry to me, but I will not hearken to them.
\[12]Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense, but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
\[13]For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah, and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem ye have set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.
\[14]Therefore do not pray thou for this people, nor lift up cry nor prayer for them, for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble.
\[15]What has my beloved to do in my house, seeing she has wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh has passed from thee? When thou do evil, then thou rejoice.
\[16]Jehovah called thy name, A green olive tree, fair with goodly fruit. With the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.
\[17]For Jehovah of hosts, who planted thee, has pronounced evil against thee because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have wrought for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal.
\[18]And Jehovah gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it. Then thou showed me their doings.
\[19]But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter. And I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit of it. And let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may no more be remembered.
\[20]But, O Jehovah of hosts, who judges righteously, who tries the heart and the mind, I shall see thy vengeance on them, for to thee I have revealed my case.
\[21]Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek thy life, saying, Thou shall not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, that thou not die by our hand.
\[22]Therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword. Their sons and their daughters shall die by famine,
\[23]and there shall be no remnant to them. For I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.

hou are righteous, O Jehovah, when I contend with thee. Yet I would reason the case with thee. Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why are all those at ease who deal very treacherously?
\[2]Thou have planted them. Yea, they have taken root, they grow. Yea, they bring forth fruit. Thou are near in their mouth, and far from their heart.
\[3]But thou, O Jehovah, know me. Thou see me, and try my heart toward thee. Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
\[4]How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? For the wickedness of those who dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds, because they said, He shall not see our latter end.
\[5]If thou have run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how can thou contend with horses? And though in a land of peace thou are secure, yet how will thou do in the pride of the Jordan?
\[6]For even thy brothers, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee, even they have cried aloud after thee. Believe them not, though they speak fair words to thee.
\[7]I have forsaken my house. I have cast off my heritage. I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
\[8]My heritage has become to me as a lion in the forest. She has uttered her voice against me. Therefore I have hated her.
\[9]Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey? Are the birds of prey against her round about? Go ye, assemble all the beasts of the field; bring them to devour.
\[10]Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard. They have trodden my portion under foot. They have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
\[11]They have made it a desolation. It mourns to me, being desolate. The whole land is made desolate, because no man lays it to heart.
\[12]Destroyers have come upon all the bare heights in the wilderness. For the sword of Jehovah devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land. No flesh has peace.
\[13]They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns. They have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing. And ye shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.
\[14]Thus says Jehovah against all my evil neighbors, who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: Behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
\[15]And it shall come to pass, after I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them. And I will bring them again, each man to his heritage, and each man to his land.
\[16]And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As Jehovah lives, even as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they shall be built up in the midst of my people.
\[17]But if they will not hear, then I will pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, says Jehovah.

hus says Jehovah to me, Go, and buy thee a linen sash, and put it upon thy loins, and do not put it in water.
\[2]So I bought a sash according to the word of Jehovah, and put it upon my loins.
\[3]And the word of Jehovah came to me the second time, saying,
\[4]Take the sash that thou have bought, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.
\[5]So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as Jehovah commanded me.
\[6]And it came to pass after many days, that Jehovah said to me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the sash from there, which I commanded thee to hide there.
\[7]Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and took the sash from the place where I had hid it. And, behold, the sash was rotten. It was good for nothing.
\[8]Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[9]Thus says Jehovah, After this manner I will mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
\[10]This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and have gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this sash, which is good for nothing.
\[11]For as the sash clings to the loins of a man, so I have caused to cling to me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, says Jehovah, that they may be to me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory, but they would not hear.
\[12]Therefore thou shall speak to them this word. Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel: Every bottle shall be filled with wine. And they shall say to thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?
\[13]Then thou shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings who sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
\[14]And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, says Jehovah. I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.
\[15]Hear ye, and give ear, be not proud, for Jehovah has spoken.
\[16]Give glory to Jehovah your God, before he causes darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains. And, while ye look for light, he turns it into the shadow of death, and makes it gross darkness.
\[17]But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret for your pride. And my eye shall weep greatly, and run down with tears, because Jehovah's flock is taken captive.
\[18]Say thou to the king and to the queen-mother: Humble yourselves. Sit down, for your coronets have come down, even the crown of your glory.
\[19]The cities of the South are shut up, and there is none to open them. Judah is carried away captive, all of it. It is wholly carried away captive.
\[20]Lift up your eyes, and behold those who come from the north. Where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?
\[21]What will thou say when he shall set over thee as head those whom thou thyself have taught to be friends to thee? Shall not sorrows take hold of thee as of a woman in travail?
\[22]And if thou say in thy heart, Why have these things come upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity thy skirts are uncovered, and thy heels suffer violence.
\[23]Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then ye also may do good, who are accustomed to do evil.
\[24]Therefore I will scatter them as the stubble that passes away by the wind of the wilderness.
\[25]This is thy lot, the portion measured to thee from me, says Jehovah, because thou have forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.
\[26]Therefore I will also uncover thy skirts upon thy face, and thy shame shall appear.
\[27]I have seen thine abominations, even thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, on the hills, in the field. Woe to thee, O Jerusalem! Thou will not be made clean. How long shall it yet be?

he word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.
\[2]Judah mourns, and the gates thereof languish. They sit in black upon the ground, and the cry of Jerusalem has gone up.
\[3]And their ranking men send their little ones to the waters. They come to the cisterns, and find no water. They return with their vessels empty. They are put to shame and confounded, and cover their heads,
\[4]because of the ground which is cracked. Because no rain has been in the land, the plowmen are put to shame; they cover their heads.
\[5]Yea, the hind also in the field calves, and forsakes it because there is no grass.
\[6]And the wild donkeys stand on the bare heights. They pant for air like jackals. Their eyes fail because there is no herbage.
\[7]Though our iniquities testify against us, work thou for thy name's sake, O Jehovah. For our backslidings are many. We have sinned against thee.
\[8]O thou hope of Israel, the Savior of it in the time of trouble, why should thou be as a sojourner in the land, and as a wayfaring man who turns aside to tarry for a night?
\[9]Why should thou be as a man frightened, as a mighty man who cannot save? Yet thou, O Jehovah, are in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name. Do not leave us.
\[10]Thus says Jehovah to this people: Even so they have loved to wander. They have not restrained their feet. Therefore Jehovah does not accept them. Now he will remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.
\[11]And Jehovah said to me, Pray not for this people for good.
\[12]When they fast, I will not hear their cry. And when they offer burnt offering and meal offering, I will not accept them. But I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
\[13]Then I said, Ah, lord Jehovah! Behold, the prophets say to them, Ye shall not see the sword, nor shall ye have famine, but I will give you assured peace in this place.
\[14]Then Jehovah said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name. I did not send them, nor have I commanded them, nor did I speak to them. They prophesy to you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of naught, and the deceit of their own heart.
\[15]Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name, and I did not send them, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed.
\[16]And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword, and they shall have none to bury them-them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters. For I will pour their wickedness upon them.
\[17]And thou shall say this word to them: Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease. For the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.
\[18]If I go forth into the field, then, behold, the slain with the sword! And if I enter into the city, then, behold, those who are sick with famine! For both the prophet and the priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge.
\[19]Have thou utterly rejected Judah? Has thy soul loathed Zion? Why have thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came, and for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!
\[20]We acknowledge, O Jehovah, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers, for we have sinned against thee.
\[21]Do not abhor us. For thy name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory. Remember, do not break thy covenant with us.
\[22]Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? Or can the heavens give showers? Are not thou he, O Jehovah our God? Therefore we will wait for thee, for thou have made all these things.

\[2]And it shall come to pass, when they say to thee, Where shall we go forth? Then thou shall tell them, Thus says Jehovah: Such as are for death, to death, and such as are for the sword, to the sword, and such as are for the famine, to the famine, and such as are for captivity, to captivity.
\[3]And I will appoint over them four kinds, says Jehovah: the sword to kill, and the dogs to tear, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy.
\[4]And I will cause them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.
\[5]For who will have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? Or who will bemoan thee? Or who will turn aside to ask of thy welfare?
\[6]Thou have rejected me, says Jehovah. Thou have gone backward. Therefore I have stretched out my hand against thee, and destroyed thee. I am weary with relenting.
\[7]And I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land. I have bereaved them of sons. I have destroyed my people. They did not return from their ways.
\[8]Their widows have increased to me above the sand of the seas. I have brought upon them, against the mother of the young men, a destroyer at noonday. I have caused anguish and terrors to fall upon her suddenly.
\[9]She who has borne seven, languishes. She has given up the spirit. Her sun has gone down while it was yet day. She has been put to shame and confounded. And the residue of them I will deliver to the sword before their enemies, says Jehovah.
\[10]Woe is me, my mother, that thou have bore me, a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have not lent, nor have men lent to me, yet every one of them curses me.
\[11]Jehovah said, Truly I will strengthen thee for good. Truly I will cause the enemy to make supplication to thee in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
\[12]Can a man break iron, even iron from the north, and brass?
\[13]Thy substance and thy treasures I will give for a spoil without price. And that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.
\[14]And I will make them to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou know not. For a fire is kindled in my anger, which shall burn upon you.
\[15]O Jehovah, thou know. Remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors. Take me not away in thy longsuffering. Know that for thy sake I have suffered reproach.
\[16]Thy words were found, and I ate them. And thy words were to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart. For I am called by thy name, O Jehovah, God of hosts.
\[17]I did not sit in the assembly of those who make merry, nor did I rejoice. I sat alone because of thy hand, for thou have filled me with indignation.
\[18]Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? Will thou indeed be to me as a deceitful brook, as waters that fail?
\[19]Therefore thus says Jehovah: If thou return, then I will bring thee again that thou may stand before me. And if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shall be as my mouth. They shall return to thee, but thou shall not return to them.
\[20]And I will make thee to this people a fortified brazen wall. And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee. For I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, says Jehovah.

\[4]They shall die grievous deaths. They shall not be lamented, nor shall they be buried; they shall be as dung upon the face of the ground. And they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine. And their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth.
\[5]For thus says Jehovah, Enter not into the house of mourning, nor go to lament, nor bemoan them, for I have taken away my peace from this people, says Jehovah, even loving kindness and tender mercies.
\[6]Both great and small shall die in this land. They shall not be buried, nor shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them,
\[7]nor shall men break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead, nor shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
\[8]And thou shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink.
\[9]For thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
\[10]And it shall come to pass, when thou shall show this people all these words, and they shall say to thee, Why has Jehovah pronounced all this great evil against us? Or what is our iniquity? Or what is our sin that we have committed against Jehovah our God?
\[11]Then thou shall say to them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, says Jehovah, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshiped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law.
\[12]And ye have done evil more than your fathers, for, behold, ye walk each one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that ye hearken not to me.
\[13]Therefore I will cast you forth out of this land into the land that ye have not known, neither ye nor your fathers, and there ye shall serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.
\[14]Therefore, behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that it shall no more be said, As Jehovah lives who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,
\[15]but, As Jehovah lives who brought up the sons of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the countries where he had driven them. And I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers.
\[16]Behold, I will send for many fishermen, says Jehovah, and they shall fish them up. And afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.
\[17]For my eyes are upon all their ways. They are not hid from my face, nor is their iniquity concealed from my eyes.
\[18]And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things, and have filled my inheritance with their abominations.
\[19]O Jehovah, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge in the day of affliction, to thee the nations shall come from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies, even vanity and things in which there is no profit.
\[20]Shall a man make to himself gods, which yet are no gods?

\[3]O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy treasures for a spoil, and thy high places, because of sin, throughout all thy borders.
\[4]And thou, even of thyself, shall discontinue from thy heritage that I gave thee, and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou know not. For ye have kindled a fire in my anger which shall burn forever.
\[5]Thus says Jehovah: Cursed is the man who trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart departs from Jehovah.
\[6]For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good comes, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt land and not inhabited.
\[7]Blessed is the man who trusts in Jehovah, and whose trust Jehovah is.
\[8]For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, that spreads out its roots by the river, and shall not fear when heat comes, but its leaf shall be green, and shall not be worried in the year of drought, nor shall cease from yielding fruit.
\[9]The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is exceedingly corrupt. Who can know it?
\[10]I, Jehovah, search the mind. I try the heart, even to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings.
\[11]As the partridge that sits on eggs which she has not laid, so is he who gets riches, and not by right. In the midst of his days they shall leave him, and at his end he shall be a fool.
\[12]A glorious throne, set on high from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary.
\[13]O Jehovah, the hope of Israel, all who forsake thee shall be put to shame. Those who depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken Jehovah, the fountain of living waters.
\[14]Heal me, O Jehovah, and I shall be healed. Save me, and I shall be saved, for thou are my praise.
\[15]Behold, they say to me, Where is the word of Jehovah? Let it come now.
\[16]As for me, I have not hastened from being a shepherd after thee, nor have I desired the woeful day. Thou know. That which came out of my lips was before thy face.
\[17]Be not a terror to me. Thou are my refuge in the day of evil.
\[18]Let them be put to shame who persecute me, but let me not be put to shame. Let them be dismayed, but let me not be dismayed. Bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.
\[19]Thus Jehovah said to me, Go, and stand in the gate of the sons of the people, by which the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem.
\[20]And say to them, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who enter in by these gates.
\[21]Thus says Jehovah: Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem.
\[22]Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, nor do ye any work. But hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.
\[23]But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and might not receive instruction.
\[24]And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken to me, says Jehovah, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but to hallow the sabbath day, to do no work in it,
\[25]then there shall enter in by the gates of this city kings and rulers sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their rulers, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And this city shall remain forever.
\[26]And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the lowland, and from the hill-country, and from the South, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meal offerings, and frankincense, and bringing things of thanksgiving, to the house of Jehovah.
\[27]But if ye will not hearken to me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in the gates of it, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.

he word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
\[2]Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.
\[3]Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he was making a work on the wheels.
\[4]And when the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter, he made it another vessel again, as seemed good to the potter to make it.
\[5]Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[6]O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? says Jehovah. Behold, as the clay in the potter's hand, so are ye in my hand, O house of Israel.
\[7]At that instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it,
\[8]if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from their evil, I will relent of the evil that I thought to do to them.
\[9]And at that instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it,
\[10]if they do that which is evil in my sight, that they obey not my voice, then I will relent of the good with which I said I would benefit them.
\[11]Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you. Return ye now everyone from his evil way, and amend your ways and your doings.
\[12]But they say, It is in vain. For we will walk after our own devices, and we will do everyone according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.
\[13]Therefore thus says Jehovah: Ask ye now among the nations, Who has heard such things? The virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.
\[14]Shall the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field? Or shall the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up?
\[15]For my people have forgotten me. They have burned incense to false gods. And they have been made to stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in bypaths, in a way not cast up,
\[16]to make their land an astonishment, and a perpetual hissing, everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shake his head.
\[17]I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy. I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.
\[18]Then they said, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah. For the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.
\[19]Give heed to me, O Jehovah, and hearken to the voice of those who contend with me.
\[20]Shall evil be recompensed for good? For they have dug a pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before thee to speak good for them, to turn away thy wrath from them.
\[21]Therefore deliver up their sons to the famine, and give them over to the power of the sword, and let their wives become childless, and widows, and let their men be slain of death, and their young men smitten of the sword in battle.
\[22]Let a cry be heard from their houses when thou shall bring a troop suddenly upon them, for they have dug a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.
\[23]Yet, Jehovah, thou know all their counsel against me to kill me. Do not forgive their iniquity, nor blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee. Deal thou with them in the time of thine anger.

hus said Jehovah: Go, and buy a potter's earthen bottle, and take of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests,
\[2]and go forth to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee.
\[3]And say, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, which whoever hears, his ears shall tingle.
\[4]Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it to other gods that they knew not, they and their fathers and the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents,
\[5]and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons in the fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither did it come into my mind.
\[6]Therefore, behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that this place shall no more be called Topheth, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of Slaughter.
\[7]And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place. And I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. And I will give their dead bodies to be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth.
\[8]And I will make this city an astonishment, and a hissing. Everyone who passes by it shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues of it.
\[9]And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters. And they shall eat each one the flesh of his friend, in the siege and in the distress with which their enemies, and those who seek their life, shall distress them.
\[10]Then thou shall break the bottle in the sight of the men who go with thee,
\[11]and shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Even so I will break this people and this city, as a potter's vessel is broken, that cannot be made whole again. And they shall bury in Topheth till there be no place to bury.
\[12]Thus I will do to this place, says Jehovah, and to the inhabitants of it, even making this city as Topheth.
\[13]And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, shall be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.
\[14]Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where Jehovah had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of Jehovah's house, and said to all the people,
\[15]Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have made their neck stiff, that they may not hear my words.

ow Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the house of Jehovah, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
\[2]Then Pashhur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of Jehovah.
\[3]And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, Jehovah has not called thy name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib.
\[4]For thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends. And they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall kill them with the sword.
\[5]Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all the gains of it, and all the precious things of it, yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give into the hand of their enemies. And they shall make them a prey, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.
\[6]And thou, Pashhur, and all who dwell in thy house shall go into captivity. And thou shall come to Babylon, and there thou shall die, and there thou shall be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou have prophesied falsely.
\[7]O Jehovah, thou have persuaded me, and I was persuaded. Thou are stronger than I, and have prevailed. I have become a laughing-stock all the day; everyone mocks me.
\[8]For as often as I speak, I cry out. I cry, Violence and destruction! Because the word of Jehovah is made a reproach to me, and a derision, all the day.
\[9]And if I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I cannot.
\[10]For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him, say all my familiar friends, those who watch for my fall. Perhaps he will be persuaded, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.
\[11]But Jehovah is with me as an awesome mighty one. Therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail. They shall be utterly put to shame, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which shall never be forgotten.
\[12]But, O Jehovah of hosts, who tries the righteous, who sees the heart and the mind, let me see thy vengeance on them, for to thee I have revealed my cause.
\[13]Sing to Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah, for he has delivered the soul of the needy man from the hand of evildoers.
\[14]Cursed be the day in which I was born. Let not the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.
\[15]Cursed be the man who brought news to my father, saying, A man-child is born to thee, making him very glad.
\[16]And let that man be as the cities which Jehovah overthrew, and did not relent. And let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontime,
\[17]because he did not kill me from the womb, and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great.
\[18]Why did I come forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?

he word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchijah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, saying,
\[2]Inquire, I pray thee, of Jehovah for us. For Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon makes war against us. Perhaps Jehovah will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.
\[3]Then Jeremiah said to them, Thus ye shall say to Zedekiah:
\[4]Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans who besiege you, outside the walls. And I will gather them into the midst of this city.
\[5]And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation.
\[6]And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast. They shall die of a great pestilence.
\[7]And afterward, says Jehovah, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, even such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life, and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword. He shall not spare them, nor have pity, nor have mercy.
\[8]And thou shall say to this people, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
\[9]He who abides in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence. But he who goes out, and passes over to the Chaldeans who besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey.
\[10]For I have set my face upon this city for evil, and not for good, says Jehovah. It shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
\[11]And concerning the house of the king of Judah, hear ye the word of Jehovah.
\[12]O house of David, thus says Jehovah: Execute justice in the morning, and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
\[13]Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and of the rock of the plain, says Jehovah, you who say, Who shall come down against us? Or who shall enter into our habitations?
\[14]And I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, says Jehovah. And I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it shall devour all that is round about her.

hus said Jehovah: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,
\[2]and say, Hear the word of Jehovah, O king of Judah, who sits upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people who enter in by these gates.
\[3]Thus says Jehovah: Execute ye justice and righteousness. And deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor. And do no wrong. Do no violence to the sojourner, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place.
\[4]For if ye do this thing indeed, then there shall enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.
\[5]But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, says Jehovah, that this house shall become a desolation.
\[6]For thus says Jehovah concerning the house of the king of Judah: Thou are Gilead to me, and the head of Lebanon, yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, cities which are not inhabited.
\[7]And I will prepare destroyers against thee, each one with his weapons, and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.
\[8]And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say each man to his neighbor, Why has Jehovah done thus to this great city?
\[9]Then they shall answer, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah their God, and worshiped other gods, and served them.
\[10]Weep ye not for him who is dead, nor bemoan him. But weep greatly for him who goes away, for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.
\[11]For thus says Jehovah concerning Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went forth out of this place: He shall not return there any more.
\[12]But in the place where they have led him captive, there he shall die, and he shall see this land no more.
\[13]Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by injustice, who uses his neighbor's service without wages, and gives him not his hire,
\[14]who says, I will build me a wide house and spacious chambers, and cuts out windows for himself, and it is overlaid with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
\[15]Shall thou reign, because thou strive to excel in cedar? Did not thy father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him.
\[16]He judged the cause of the poor and needy man, then it was well. Was not this to know me? says Jehovah.
\[17]But thine eyes and thy heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.
\[18]Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah. They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! They shall not lament for him, saying Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!
\[19]He shall be buried with the burial of a donkey, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
\[20]Go up to Lebanon, and cry. And lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from Abarim. For all thy lovers are destroyed.
\[21]I spoke to thee in thy prosperity, but thou said, I will not hear. This has been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyed not my voice.
\[22]The wind shall feed all thy shepherds, and thy loved ones shall go into captivity. Surely then thou shall be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.
\[23]O inhabitant of Lebanon, who makes thy nest in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied thou shall be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!
\[24]As I live, says Jehovah, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet I would pluck thee from there,
\[25]and I will give thee into the hand of those who seek thy life, and into the hand of those of whom thou are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\[26]And I will cast thee out, and thy mother who bore thee, into another country where ye were not born, and there ye shall die.
\[27]But to the land to which their soul longs to return, there they shall not return.
\[28]Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel? Is he a vessel in which none delights? Why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into the land which they know not?
\[29]O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Jehovah.
\[30]Thus says Jehovah: Write ye this man childless, a man who shall not prosper in his days. For no more shall a man of his seed prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling in Judah.

\[2]Therefore thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, against the shepherds who feed my people: Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them. Behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, says Jehovah.
\[3]And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds, and they shall be fruitful and multiply.
\[4]And I will set up shepherds over them who shall feed them. And they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed. Neither shall any be lacking, says Jehovah.
\[5]Behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
\[6]In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely. And this is his name by which he shall be called: Jehovah our righteousness.
\[7]Therefore, behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that they shall no more say, As Jehovah lives, who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,
\[8]but, As Jehovah lives, who brought up and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries where I had driven them. And they shall dwell in their own land.
\[9]Concerning the prophets: My heart within me is broken. All my bones shake. I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, because of Jehovah, and because of his holy words.
\[10]For the land is full of adulterers. For because of swearing the land mourns. The pastures of the wilderness are dried up. And their course is evil, and their might is not right.
\[11]For both prophet and priest are profane. Yea, in my house I have found their wickedness, says Jehovah.
\[12]Therefore their way shall be to them as slippery places in the darkness. They shall be driven on, and fall in it. For I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, says Jehovah.
\[13]And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria. They prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.
\[14]In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing. They commit adultery, and walk in lies. And they strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that none returns from his wickedness. They have all of them become to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
\[15]Therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall. For from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone forth into all the land.
\[16]Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Hearken not to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They teach you vanity. They speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of Jehovah.
\[17]They say continually to those who despise me, Jehovah has said, Ye shall have peace. And to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, No evil shall come upon you.
\[18]For who has stood in the council of Jehovah, that he should perceive and hear his word? Who has marked my word, and heard it?
\[19]Behold, the tempest of Jehovah, wrath, has gone forth, yea, a whirling tempest. It shall burst upon the head of the wicked.
\[20]The anger of Jehovah shall not return until he has executed, and till he has performed the intents of his heart. In the latter days ye shall understand it perfectly.
\[21]I did not send these prophets, yet they ran. I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.
\[22]But if they had stood in my council, then they would have caused my people to hear my words, and would have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
\[23]Am I a God at hand, says Jehovah, and not a God afar off?
\[24]Can any man hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see him? says Jehovah. Do I not fill heaven and earth? says Jehovah.
\[25]I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
\[26]How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?
\[27]Who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgot my name for Baal.
\[28]The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream. And he who has my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat? says Jehovah.
\[29]Is not my word like fire? says Jehovah, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?
\[30]Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, says Jehovah, who steal my words each one from his neighbor.
\[31]Behold, I am against the prophets, says Jehovah, who use their tongues, and say, He says.
\[32]Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, says Jehovah, and tell them. And cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting. Yet I sent them not, nor commanded them, neither do they profit this people at all, says Jehovah.
\[33]And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of Jehovah? Then thou shall say to them, What burden! I will cast you off, says Jehovah.
\[34]And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, who shall say, The burden of Jehovah, I will even punish that man and his house.
\[35]Thus ye shall say each one to his neighbor, and each one to his brother: What has Jehovah answered? and, What has Jehovah spoken?
\[36]And the burden of Jehovah ye shall mention no more, for every man's own word shall be his burden. For ye have perverted the words of the living God, of Jehovah of hosts our God.
\[37]Thus thou shall say to the prophet: What has Jehovah answered thee? and, What has Jehovah spoken?
\[38]But if ye say, The burden of Jehovah, therefore thus says Jehovah: Because ye say this word, The burden of Jehovah, and I have sent to you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of Jehovah,
\[39]therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you. And I will cast you off, and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers, away from my presence.
\[40]And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.

\[2]One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first ripe, and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten they were so bad.

\[9]I will even give them up to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I shall drive them.

\[2]which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,
\[3]From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three years, the word of Jehovah has come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking. But ye have not hearkened.
\[4]And Jehovah has sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, (but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear),
\[5]saying, Return ye now each one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Jehovah has given to you and to your fathers, from of old and even for evermore.
\[6]And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the work of your hands. And I will do you no hurt.

\[9]behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, says Jehovah, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants of it, and against all these nations round about. And I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.
\[10]Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.
\[11]And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment. And these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
\[12]And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, says Jehovah, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and I will make it desolate forever.
\[13]And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
\[14]For many nations and great kings shall make bondmen of them, even of them, and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.
\[15]For thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, to me: Take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.
\[16]And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.
\[17]Then I took the cup at Jehovah's hand, and made all the nations to drink, to whom Jehovah had sent me:
\[18]Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings of it, and the rulers of it, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day,
\[19]Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his rulers, and all his people,
\[20]and all the mixed people, and all the kings of the land of the Uz, and all the kings of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,
\[21]Edom, and Moab, and the sons of Ammon,
\[22]and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea,
\[23]Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all who have the corners of their hair cut off,
\[24]and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness,
\[25]and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,
\[26]and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth. And the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
\[27]And thou shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.
\[28]And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, then thou shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Ye shall surely drink.
\[29]For, lo, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished. For I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, says Jehovah of hosts.
\[30]Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say to them, Jehovah will roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation. He will mightily roar against his fold. He will give a shout, as those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
\[31]A noise shall come even to the end of the earth, for Jehovah has a controversy with the nations. He will enter into judgment with all flesh. As for the wicked, he will give them to the sword, says Jehovah.
\[32]Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be raised up from the outermost parts of the earth.
\[33]And the slain of Jehovah shall be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth. They shall not be lamented, nor gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the face of the ground.
\[34]Wail, ye shepherds, and cry. And wallow, ye principal men of the flock. For the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions have fully come, and ye shall fall like a goodly vessel.
\[35]And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal men of the flock to escape.
\[36]A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the wailing of the principal men of the flock! For Jehovah lays waste their pasture.
\[37]And the peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.
\[38]He has left his covert as the lion. For their land has become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppressing sword, and because of his fierce anger.

n the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word from Jehovah came, saying,
\[2]Thus says Jehovah: Stand in the court of Jehovah's house, and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in Jehovah's house, all the words that I command thee to speak to them, diminish not a word.
\[3]It may be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may relent of the evil which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings.
\[4]And thou shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah: If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,
\[5]to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send to you, even rising up early and sending them, but ye have not hearkened,
\[6]then I will make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
\[7]And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jehovah.
\[8]And it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that Jehovah had commanded him to speak to all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him, saying, Thou shall surely die.
\[9]Why have thou prophesied in the name of Jehovah, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant? And all the people were gathered to Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah.
\[10]And when the rulers of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of Jehovah, and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Jehovah's house.
\[11]Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the rulers and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy of death, for he has prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.
\[12]Then Jeremiah spoke to all the rulers and to all the people, saying, Jehovah sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.
\[13]Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of Jehovah your God, and Jehovah will relent of the evil that he has pronounced against you.
\[14]But as for me, behold, I am in your hand. Do with me as is good and right in your eyes.
\[15]Only know ye for certain that, if ye put me to death, ye will bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants of it. For of a truth Jehovah has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.
\[16]Then the rulers and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets. This man is not worthy of death, for he has spoken to us in the name of Jehovah our God.
\[17]Then certain of the elders of the land rose up, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,
\[18]Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
\[19]Did Hezekiah king of Judah, and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear Jehovah, and entreat the favor of Jehovah. And Jehovah relented of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we commit great evil against our own souls.
\[20]And there was also a man who prophesied in the name of Jehovah, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath-jearim. And he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.
\[21]And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the rulers, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death, but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt.
\[22]And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt,
\[23]and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who killed him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
\[24]But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.

n the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
\[2]Thus says Jehovah to me: Make thee bonds and bars, and put them upon thy neck.
\[3]And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the sons of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.
\[4]And give them a charge to their masters, saying, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Thus ye shall say to your masters:
\[5]I have made the earth, the men and the beasts that are upon the face of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and I give it to whom it seems right to me.
\[6]And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant. And the beasts of the field I have also given him to serve him.
\[7]And all the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the time of his own land comes. And then many nations and great kings shall make him their bondman.
\[8]And it shall come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will punish, says Jehovah, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.
\[9]But as for you, hearken ye not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon.
\[10]For they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.
\[11]But the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, that nation I will let remain in their own land, says Jehovah, and they shall till it, and dwell therein.
\[12]And I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
\[13]Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as Jehovah has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
\[14]And hearken not to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon, for they prophesy a lie to you.
\[15]For I have not sent them, says Jehovah, but they prophesy falsely in my name, that I may drive you out, and that ye may perish, ye, and the prophets who prophesy to you.
\[16]Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus says Jehovah: Hearken not to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of Jehovah's house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon, for they prophesy a lie to you.
\[17]Hearken not to them. Serve the king of Babylon, and live. Why should this city become a desolation?
\[18]But if they are prophets, and if the word of Jehovah is with them, let them now make intercession to Jehovah of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, not go to Babylon.
\[19]For thus says Jehovah of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the stands, and concerning the residue of the vessels that are left in this city,
\[20]which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem.
\[21]Yea, thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem:
\[22]They shall be carried to Babylon, and there they shall be until the day that I visit them, says Jehovah. Then I will bring them up, and restore them to this place.

nd it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of Jehovah, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,
\[2]Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
\[3]Within two full years I will bring again into this place all the vessels of Jehovah's house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon.
\[4]And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, who went to Babylon, says Jehovah, for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
\[5]Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of Jehovah,
\[6]even the prophet Jeremiah said, Truly! Jehovah do so. Jehovah perform thy words which thou have prophesied, to bring again the vessels of Jehovah's house, and all those of the captivity, from Babylon to this place.
\[7]Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people:
\[8]The prophets who have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
\[9]The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then the prophet shall be known that Jehovah has truly sent him.
\[10]Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and broke it.
\[11]And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus says Jehovah: Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
\[12]Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
\[13]Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus says Jehovah: Thou have broken the bars of wood, but I have made in their stead bars of iron.
\[14]For thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may served Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they shall serve him. And I have given him the beasts of the field also.
\[15]Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah. Jehovah has not sent thee, but thou make this people to trust in a lie.
\[16]Therefore thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will send thee away from off the face of the earth. This year thou shall die because thou have spoken rebellion against Jehovah.
\[17]So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.

ow these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon,
\[2](after Jeconiah the king, and the queen-mother, and the eunuchs, and the rulers of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem),
\[3]by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), saying,
\[4]Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the captivity whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon:
\[5]Build ye houses, and dwell in them, and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
\[6]Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters. And take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters, and multiply ye there, and be not diminished.
\[7]And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray to Jehovah for it, for in the peace of it ye shall have peace.
\[8]For thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Let not your prophets who are in the midst of you, and your diviners, deceive you, nor hearken ye to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.
\[9]For they prophesy falsely to you in my name. I have not sent them, says Jehovah.
\[10]For thus says Jehovah, After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place.
\[11]For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says Jehovah, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope in your latter end.
\[12]And ye shall call upon me, and ye shall go and pray to me, and I will hearken to you.
\[13]And ye shall seek me, and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart.
\[14]And I will be found by you, says Jehovah, and I will turn again your captivity. And I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, says Jehovah, and I will bring you again to the place from where I caused you to be carried away captive.
\[15]Because ye have said, Jehovah has raised us up prophets in Babylon,
\[16]thus says Jehovah concerning the king who sits upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your brothers who have not gone forth with you into captivity,
\[17]thus says Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten they are so bad.
\[18]And I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an execration, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations where I have driven them,
\[19]because they have not hearkened to my words, says Jehovah, with which I sent to them my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them. But ye would not hear, says Jehovah.
\[20]Hear ye therefore the word of Jehovah, all ye of the captivity whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.
\[21]Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in my name. Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall kill them before your eyes.
\[22]And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah that are in Babylon, saying, Jehovah make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,
\[23]because they have wrought folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I did not command them. And I am he who knows, and am witness, says Jehovah.
\[24]And concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou shall speak, saying,
\[25]Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou have sent letters in thine own name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
\[26]Jehovah has made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in the house of Jehovah, for every man who is mad, and makes himself a prophet, that thou should put him in the stocks and in shackles.
\[27]Now therefore, why have thou not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you,
\[28]inasmuch as he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, It is long. Build ye houses, and dwell in them, and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them?
\[29]And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
\[30]Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,
\[31]Send to all those of the captivity, saying, Thus says Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I did not send him, and he has caused you to trust in a lie,
\[32]therefore thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed. He shall not have a man to dwell among this people, nor shall he behold the good that I will do to my people, says Jehovah, because he has spoken rebellion against Jehovah.

he word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
\[2]Thus speaks Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken to thee in a book.
\[3]For, lo, the days come, says Jehovah, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, says Jehovah, and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
\[4]And these are the words that Jehovah spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
\[5]For thus says Jehovah: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.
\[6]Ask ye now, and see whether a man travails with child. Why do I see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
\[7]Alas! For that day is great, so that none is like it. It is even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.
\[8]And it shall come to pass in that day, says Jehovah of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds. And strangers shall no more make him their bondman,
\[9]but they shall serve Jehovah their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.
\[10]Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, says Jehovah, nor be dismayed, O Israel. For, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity, and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.
\[11]For I am with thee, says Jehovah, to save thee. For I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered thee, but I will not make a full end of thee. But I will correct thee in measure, and will in no way leave thee unpunished.
\[12]For thus says Jehovah, Thy hurt is incurable, and thy wound grievous.
\[13]There is none to plead thy cause, that thou may be bound up; thou have no healing medicines.
\[14]All who love thee have forgotten thee; they seek thee not. For I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased.
\[15]Why do thou cry for thy hurt? Thy pain is incurable, for the greatness of thine iniquity. Because thy sins were increased, I have done these things to thee.
\[16]Therefore all those who devour thee shall be devoured, and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity. And those who despoil thee shall be a spoil, and all who prey upon thee I will give for a prey.
\[17]For I will restore health to thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, says Jehovah, because they have called thee an outcast, saying, It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.
\[18]Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places. And the city shall be built upon its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner.
\[19]And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry. And I will multiply them, and they shall not be few. I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
\[20]Their sons also shall be as formerly, and their congregation shall be established before me. And I will punish all who oppress them.
\[21]And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them. And I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach to me. For who is he who has had boldness to approach to me? says Jehovah.
\[22]And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
\[23]Behold, the tempest of Jehovah-wrath-has gone forth, a sweeping tempest. It shall burst upon the head of the wicked.
\[24]The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not return until he has executed, and till he has performed the intents of his heart. In the latter days ye shall understand it.

t that time, says Jehovah, I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.
\[2]Thus says Jehovah: The people who were left of the sword found favor in the wilderness, even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.
\[3]Jehovah appeared of old to me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love. Therefore with loving kindness I have drawn thee.
\[4]Again I will build thee, and thou shall be built, O virgin of Israel. Again thou shall be adorned with thy tambourine, and shall go forth in the dances of those who make merry.
\[5]Again thou shall plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria. The planters shall plant, and shall enjoy it.
\[6]For there shall be a day that the watchmen upon the hills of Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion to Jehovah our God.
\[7]For thus says Jehovah: Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout for the chief of the nations. Publish ye, praise ye, and say, O Jehovah, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.
\[8]Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the outermost parts of the earth, and with them the blind man and the lame man, the woman with child, and she who travails with child together. They shall return here a great company.
\[9]They shall come with weeping. And I will lead them with supplications. I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way in which they shall not stumble. For I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.
\[10]Hear the word of Jehovah, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He who scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd does his flock.
\[11]For Jehovah has ransomed Jacob, and redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he.
\[12]And they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow to the goodness of Jehovah, to the grain, and to the new wine, and to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd. And their soul shall be as a watered garden, and they shall not sorrow any more at all.
\[13]Then the virgin shall rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together, for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
\[14]And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, says Jehovah.
\[15]Thus says Jehovah: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping. Rachel weeping for her children, she refused to be comforted for her children, because they are not.
\[16]Thus says Jehovah: Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears, for thy work shall be rewarded, says Jehovah, and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.
\[17]And there is hope for thy latter end, says Jehovah, and thy sons shall come again to their own border.
\[18]I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself saying, Thou have chastised me, and I was chastised as a calf unaccustomed to the yoke. Turn thou me back, and I shall be turned back, for thou are Jehovah my God.
\[19]Surely after that I was turned back. I repented, and after I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh. I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I bore the reproach of my youth.
\[20]Is Ephraim my dear son? Is he a darling child? For as often as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still. Therefore my heart yearns for him. I will surely have mercy upon him, says Jehovah.
\[21]Set thee up road marks. Make thee guideposts. Set thy heart toward the highway, even the way by which thou went. Turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.
\[22]How long will thou go here and there, O thou backsliding daughter? For Jehovah has created a new thing in the earth: a woman shall encompass a man.
\[23]Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Yet again they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof when I shall bring again their captivity: Jehovah bless thee, O habitation of righteousness, O mountain of holiness.
\[24]And Judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell in there together, the husbandmen, and those who go about with flocks.
\[25]For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul I have replenished.
\[26]Upon this I awoke, and beheld, and my sleep was sweet to me.
\[27]Behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.
\[28]And it shall come to pass that, just as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says Jehovah.
\[29]In those days they shall no more say, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the son's teeth are set on edge.
\[30]But everyone shall die for his own iniquity. Every man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.
\[31]Behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah,
\[32]not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in my covenant, and I disregarded them, says Jehovah.
\[33]But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says Jehovah: I will give my laws into their mind, and I will write them on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
\[34]And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah, for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says Jehovah. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
\[35]Thus says Jehovah, who gives the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirs up the sea, so that the waves thereof roar. Jehovah of hosts is his name.
\[36]If these ordinances depart from before me, says Jehovah, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me forever.
\[37]Thus says Jehovah: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, says Jehovah.
\[38]Behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that the city shall be built to Jehovah from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner.
\[39]And the measuring line shall go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb, and shall turn about to Goah.
\[40]And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields, to the brook Kidron, to the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy to Jehovah. It shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more forever.

he word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
\[2]Now at that time the king of Babylon's army was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah's house.
\[3]For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do thou prophesy, and say, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.
\[4]And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes.
\[5]And he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall be until I visit him, says Jehovah. Though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?
\[6]And Jeremiah said, The word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[7]Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come to thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth. For the right of redemption is thine to buy it.
\[8]So Hanamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Jehovah, and said to me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin. For the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine. Buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of Jehovah.
\[9]And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle's son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.
\[10]And I signed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.
\[11]So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, according to the law and custom, and that which was open,
\[12]and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.
\[13]And I charged Baruch before them, saying,
\[14]Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue many days.
\[15]For thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land.
\[16]Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to Jehovah, saying,
\[17]Ah lord Jehovah! Behold, thou have made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for thee,
\[18]who show loving kindness to thousands, and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them, the great, the mighty God. Jehovah of hosts is his name,
\[19]great in counsel, and mighty in work, whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings,
\[20]who set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, both in Israel and among other men, and made thee a name, as at this day,
\[21]and brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror,
\[22]and gave them this land, which thou swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.
\[23]And they came in, and possessed it, but they obeyed not thy voice, nor walked in thy law. They have done nothing of all that thou commanded them to do. Therefore thou have caused all this evil to come upon them.
\[24]Behold, the mounds. They have come to the city to take it. And the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence. And what thou have spoken has come to pass, and, behold, thou see it.
\[25]And thou have said to me, O lord Jehovah, Buy thee the field for money, and call witnesses, whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\[26]Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,
\[27]Behold, I am Jehovah, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for me?
\[28]Therefore thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it.
\[29]And the Chaldeans, who fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses upon whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.
\[30]For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth. For the sons of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says Jehovah.
\[31]For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day, that I should remove it from before my face,
\[32]because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and of the sons of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their rulers, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[33]And they have turned the back to me, and not the face. And though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.
\[34]But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.
\[35]And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech, which I did not command them, nor did it come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
\[36]And now therefore thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning this city, of which ye say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:
\[37]Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation. And I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely.
\[38]And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
\[39]And I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for the good of them, and of their sons after them.
\[40]And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good. And I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.
\[41]Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good. And I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
\[42]For thus says Jehovah: Just as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.
\[43]And fields shall be bought in this land, of which ye say, It is desolate, without man or beast. It is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\[44]Men shall buy fields for money, and sign the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South. For I will cause their captivity to return, says Jehovah.

oreover the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard, saying,
\[2]Thus says Jehovah who does it, Jehovah who forms it to establish it; Jehovah is his name:
\[3]Call to me, and I will answer thee, and will show thee great things, and difficult, which thou know not.
\[4]For thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down to defend against the mounds and against the sword,
\[5]while men come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in my anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city:
\[6]Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them. And I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth.
\[7]And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them as at the first.
\[8]And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against me. And I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against me, and by which they have transgressed against me.
\[9]And this city shall be to me for a name of joy, for a praise and for a glory, before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them, and shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I procure to it.
\[10]Thus says Jehovah: Yet again there shall be heard in this place-of which ye say, It is waste, without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without beast-
\[11]the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, Give thanks to Jehovah of hosts, for Jehovah is good, for his loving kindness is forever, and of those who bring thanksgiving into the house of Jehovah. For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, says Jehovah.
\[12]Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Yet again there shall be in this place, which is waste, without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.
\[13]In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks shall again pass under the hands of him who numbers them, says Jehovah.
\[14]Behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.
\[15]In those days, and at that time, I will cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David, and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
\[16]In those days Judah shall be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely. And this is the name whereby she shall be called: Jehovah our righteousness.
\[17]For thus says Jehovah: David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel,
\[18]neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to burn meal offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.
\[19]And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,
\[20]Thus says Jehovah: If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, so that there shall not be day and night in their season,
\[21]then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he shall not have a son to reign upon his throne, and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
\[22]As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured, so I will multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister to me.
\[23]And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,
\[24]Consider thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which Jehovah chose, he has cast them off? Thus they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.
\[25]Thus says Jehovah: If my covenant of day and night stand not, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth,
\[26]then I will also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will cause their captivity to return, and will have mercy on them.

he word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,
\[2]Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel: Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
\[3]And thou shall not escape out of his hand, but shall surely be taken, and delivered into his hand. And thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shall go to Babylon.
\[4]Yet hear the word of Jehovah, O Zedekiah king of Judah. Thus says Jehovah concerning thee, Thou shall not die by the sword;
\[5]thou shall die in peace. And with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings who were before thee, so shall they make a burning for thee. And they shall lament thee, saying, Ah lord! For I have spoken the word, says Jehovah.
\[6]Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah, king of Judah in Jerusalem,
\[7]when the king of Babylon's army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah, for these alone remained of the cities of Judah, fortified cities.
\[8]The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, after the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them,
\[9]that every man should let his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free, that none should make bondmen of them, namely, of a Jew his brother.
\[10]And all the rulers and all the people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant, that everyone should let his man-servant, and everyone his maid-servant, go free, that none should make bondmen of them any more. They obeyed, and let them go.
\[11]But afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.
\[12]Therefore the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
\[13]Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,
\[14]At the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to thee, and has served thee six years. Thou shall let him go free from thee. But your fathers hearkened not to me, nor inclined their ear.
\[15]And ye were now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor. And ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name.
\[16]But ye turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had let go free at their pleasure, to return. And ye brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.
\[17]Therefore thus says Jehovah: Ye have not hearkened to me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor. Behold, I proclaim to you a liberty, says Jehovah-to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine. And I will make you to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth.
\[18]And I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between the parts of it,
\[19]the rulers of Judah, and the rulers of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf,
\[20]I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life. And their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the earth.
\[21]And I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, and his rulers, into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army that has gone away from you.
\[22]Behold, I will command, says Jehovah, and cause them to return to this city. And they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire. And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.

he word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
\[2]Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of Jehovah, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.
\[3]Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites.
\[4]And I brought them into the house of Jehovah, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was by the chamber of the rulers, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold.
\[5]And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups, and I said to them, Drink ye wine.
\[6]But they said, We will drink no wine. For Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons, forever.
\[7]Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any, but all your days ye shall dwell in tents, that ye may live many days in the land in which ye sojourn.
\[8]And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters,
\[9]nor to build houses for us to dwell in. Neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed,
\[10]but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
\[11]But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians. So we dwell at Jerusalem.
\[12]Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,
\[13]Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Go, and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? says Jehovah.
\[14]The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed. And to this day they drink none, for they obey their father's commandment. But I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking, and ye have not hearkened to me.
\[15]I have also sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers. But ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened to me.
\[16]Inasmuch as the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not hearkened to me,
\[17]therefore thus says Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard, and I have called to them, but they have not answered.
\[18]And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he commanded you,
\[19]therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me forever.

nd it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
\[2]Take thee a roll of a book, and write in it all the words that I have spoken to thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to thee, from the days of Josiah, even to this day.
\[3]It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them, that they may return every man from his evil way, that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
\[4]Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah. And Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah, which he had spoken to him, upon a roll of a book.
\[5]And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up. I cannot go into the house of Jehovah.
\[6]Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou have written from my mouth, the words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in Jehovah's house upon the fast-day. And also thou shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities.
\[7]It may be they will present their supplication before Jehovah, and will return each one from his evil way, for great is the anger and the wrath that Jehovah has pronounced against this people.
\[8]And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of Jehovah in Jehovah's house.
\[9]Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Jehovah.
\[10]Then Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Jehovah's house, in the ears of all the people.
\[11]And when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of Jehovah,
\[12]he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber. And, lo, all the rulers were sitting there: Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the rulers.
\[13]Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.
\[14]Therefore all the rulers sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take in thy hand the roll from which thou have read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came to them.
\[15]And they said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.
\[16]Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.
\[17]And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did thou write all these words at his mouth?
\[18]Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.
\[19]Then the rulers said to Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah, and let no man know where ye are.
\[20]And they went in to the king into the court, but they had laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and they told all the words in the ears of the king.
\[21]So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll, and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the rulers who stood beside the king.
\[22]Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month, and the brazier was burning before him.
\[23]And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that the king cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.
\[24]And they were not afraid, nor tore their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all these words.
\[25]Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll, but he would not hear them.
\[26]And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but Jehovah hid them.
\[27]Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
\[28]Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.
\[29]And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah thou shall say, Thus says Jehovah: Thou have burned this roll, saying, Why have thou written in it, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from there man and beast?
\[30]Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David. And his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.
\[31]And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity. And I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they did not hearken.
\[32]Then Jeremiah took another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote in it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire, and there were added besides to them many like words.

nd Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.
\[2]But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, hearkened to the words of Jehovah, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.
\[3]And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to Jehovah our God for us.
\[4]Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people, for they had not put him into prison.
\[5]And Pharaoh's army came forth out of Egypt. And when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they broke away from Jerusalem.
\[6]Then the word of Jehovah came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
\[7]Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me: Behold, Pharaoh's army, which has come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.
\[8]And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and they shall take it, and burn it with fire.
\[9]Thus says Jehovah: Do not deceive yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us. For they shall not depart.
\[10]For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yea they would rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.
\[11]And it came to pass that, when the army of the Chaldeans was broken away from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,
\[12]then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin to receive his portion there in the midst of the people.
\[13]And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah. And he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou are falling away to the Chaldeans.
\[14]Then Jeremiah said, It is false. I am not falling away to the Chaldeans. But he did not hearken to him. So Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the rulers.
\[15]And the rulers were angry with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe, for they had made that the prison.
\[16]When Jeremiah came into the dungeon-house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days,
\[17]then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him. And the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from Jehovah? And Jeremiah said, There is. He also said, Thou shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.
\[18]Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, How have I sinned against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?
\[19]Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?
\[20]And now hear, I pray thee, O my lord the king. Let my supplication, I pray thee, be presented before thee, that thou not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
\[21]Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard. And they gave him a loaf of bread daily out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.

nd Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying,
\[2]Thus says Jehovah: He who abides in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, but he who goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey, and he shall live.
\[3]Thus says Jehovah: This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.
\[4]Then the rulers said to the king, Let this man, we pray thee, be put to death, inasmuch as he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them. For this man seeks not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
\[5]And Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand, for the king is not he who can do anything against you.
\[6]Then they took Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king's son, that was in the court of the guard. And they let Jeremiah down with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire, and Jeremiah sank in the mire.
\[7]Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin),
\[8]Ebed-melech went forth out of the king's house, and spoke to the king, saying,
\[9]My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the dungeon. And he is likely to die in the place where he is because of the famine, for there is no more bread in the city.
\[10]Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from here thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he dies.
\[11]So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
\[12]And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Now put these rags and worn-out garments under thine armpits under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.
\[13]So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
\[14]Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of Jehovah. And the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.
\[15]Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to thee, will thou not surely put me to death? And if I give thee counsel, thou will not hearken to me.
\[16]So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, As Jehovah lives, who made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, nor will I give thee into the hand of these men who seek thy life.
\[17]Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, Thus says Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel. If thou will go forth to the king of Babylon's rulers, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and thou shall live, and thy house.
\[18]But if thou will not go forth to the king of Babylon's rulers, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shall not escape out of their hand.
\[19]And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews who have fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they abuse me.
\[20]But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of Jehovah, in that which I speak to thee, so it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live.
\[21]But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that Jehovah has shown me:
\[22]Behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's rulers. And those women shall say, Thy familiar friends have set upon thee, and have prevailed over thee. Since thy feet are sunk in the mire, they have turned back away.
\[23]And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy sons to the Chaldeans. And thou shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. And thou shall cause this city to be burned with fire.
\[24]Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shall not die.
\[25]But if the rulers hear that I have talked with thee, and they come to thee, and say to thee, Declare to us now what thou have said to the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death, also what the king said to thee,
\[26]then thou shall say to them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house to die there.
\[27]Then all the rulers came to Jeremiah, and asked him. And he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him, for the matter was not perceived.
\[28]So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.

nd it came to pass when Jerusalem was taken, in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem, and besieged it.
\[2]In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city.
\[3]And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, to wit, Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.
\[4]And it came to pass that, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, through the gate between the two walls, and he went out toward the Arabah.
\[5]But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he gave judgment upon him.
\[6]Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes. Also the king of Babylon killed all the nobles of Judah.
\[7]Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him in fetters to carry him to Babylon.
\[8]And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
\[9]Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people that remained in the city, the deserters also that fell away to him, and the residue of the people that remained.
\[10]But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, that had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
\[11]Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,
\[12]Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm, but do to him even as he shall say to thee.
\[13]So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon.
\[14]And they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home. So he dwelt among the people.
\[15]Now the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,
\[16]Go, and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good, and they shall be accomplished before thee in that day.
\[17]But I will deliver thee in that day, says Jehovah, and thou shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou are afraid.
\[18]For I will surely save thee, and thou shall not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey to thee, because thou have put thy trust in me, says Jehovah.

he word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were carried away captive to Babylon.
\[2]And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, Jehovah thy God pronounced this evil upon this place,
\[3]and Jehovah has brought it, and done according as he spoke. Because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing has come upon you.
\[4]And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which are upon thy hand. If it seem good to thee to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will look well to thee, but if it seems ill to thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear. Behold, all the land is before thee, where it seems good and right to thee to go, there go.
\[5]Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back then to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people, or go wherever it seems right to thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him food and a present, and let him go.
\[6]Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people who were left in the land.
\[7]Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, and women, and sons, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon,
\[8]then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, namely, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
\[9]And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
\[10]As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who shall come to us. But ye, gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.
\[11]Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the sons of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan,
\[12]then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered very much wine and summer fruits.
\[13]Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
\[14]and said to him, Do thou know that Baalis the king of the sons of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take thy life? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them.
\[15]Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it. Why should he take thy life, that all the Jews who are gathered to thee should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?
\[16]But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shall not do this thing, for thou speak falsely of Ishmael.

ow it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal and one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and there they ate bread together in Mizpah.
\[2]Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him, arose and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
\[3]Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him, namely, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.
\[4]And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,
\[5]that men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having their beards shaven and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Jehovah.
\[6]And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went. And it came to pass, as he met them, he said to them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
\[7]And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men who were with him.
\[8]But ten men were found among those who said to Ishmael, Kill us not, for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he held back, and did not kill them among their brothers.
\[9]Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain by the side of Gedaliah (the same was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were slain.
\[10]Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people who were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the sons of Ammon.
\[11]But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
\[12]then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.
\[13]Now it came to pass that, when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, then they were glad.
\[14]So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.
\[15]But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the sons of Ammon.
\[16]Then Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, namely, the men of war, and the women, and the sons, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon.
\[17]And they departed, and dwelt in Geruth Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt
\[18]because of the Chaldeans, for they were afraid of them because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land.

\[3]that Jehovah thy God may show us the way in which we should walk, and the thing that we should do.
\[4]Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to Jehovah your God according to your words, and it shall come to pass that whatever thing Jehovah shall answer you, I will declare it to you. I will keep nothing back from you.
\[5]Then they said to Jeremiah, Jehovah be a true and faithful witness amongst us, if we do not according to all the word with which Jehovah thy God shall send thee to us.
\[6]Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of Jehovah our God, to whom we send thee, that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of Jehovah our God.

\[10]If ye will still abide in this land, then I will build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up, for I relent of the evil that I have done to you.
\[11]Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid. Be not afraid of him, says Jehovah, for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.
\[12]And I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.
\[13]But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, so that ye do not obey the voice of Jehovah your God,
\[14]saying, No, but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread, and we will dwell there-
\[15]Now therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, O remnant of Judah. Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: If ye indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there,
\[16]then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, of which ye are afraid, shall follow hard after you there in Egypt, and there ye shall die.
\[17]So shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there. They shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.
\[18]For thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: As my anger and my wrath has been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured forth upon you when ye shall enter into Egypt. And ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach. And ye shall see this place no more.
\[19]Jehovah has spoken concerning you, O remnant of Judah, Go ye not into Egypt. Know certainly that I have testified to you this day.
\[20]For ye have dealt deceitfully against your own souls. For ye sent me to Jehovah your God, saying, Pray for us to Jehovah our God, and according to all that Jehovah our God shall say, so declare to us, and we will do it.
\[21]And I have this day declared it to you. But ye have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah your God in anything for which he has sent me to you.
\[22]Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place where ye desire to go to sojourn there.

he word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who dwelt in the land of Egypt, who dwelt at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying,
\[2]Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah. And, behold, this day they are a desolation. And no man dwells therein
\[3]because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, that they knew not, neither they, nor ye, nor your fathers.
\[4]However I sent all my servants the prophets to you, rising up early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not do this abominable thing that I hate.
\[5]But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to other gods.
\[6]Therefore my wrath and my anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they are wasted and desolate, as it is this day.
\[7]Therefore now thus says Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Why do ye commit this great evil against your own souls, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, to leave you none remaining,
\[8]in that ye provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where ye have gone to sojourn, that ye may be cut off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
\[9]Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives which they committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\[10]They are not humbled even to this day. Neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.
\[11]Therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah.
\[12]And I will take the remnant of Judah, who have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed. In the land of Egypt they shall fall. They shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine. They shall die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine, and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
\[13]For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence,
\[14]so that none of the remnant of Judah who have gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or be left to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there. For none shall return except such as shall escape.
\[15]Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, even all the people who dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
\[16]As for the word that thou have spoken to us in the name of Jehovah, we will not hearken to thee.
\[17]But we will certainly perform every word that has gone forth out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our rulers, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem. For then we had plenty of food, and were well, and saw no evil.
\[18]But since we left off burning incense to the queen of heaven, and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.
\[19]And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her, without our husbands?
\[20]Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people who had given him that answer, saying,
\[21]The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your rulers, and the people of the land, did Jehovah not remember them, and did it not come into his mind?
\[22]So that Jehovah could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed. Therefore your land has become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day.
\[23]Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies, therefore this evil has happened to you, as it is this day.
\[24]Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of Jehovah, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt:
\[25]Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her. Establish then your vows, and perform your vows.
\[26]Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, says Jehovah, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the lord Jehovah lives.
\[27]Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good. And all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there is an end of them.
\[28]And those who escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number. And all the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs.
\[29]And this shall be the sign to you, says Jehovah, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:
\[30]Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those who seek his life, as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy, and sought his life.

\[2]Of Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh-neco king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
\[3]Prepare ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
\[4]Harness the horses, and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets. Furbish the spears. Put on the coats of mail.
\[5]Why have I seen it? They are dismayed and have turned backward. And their mighty ones are beaten down, and have fled apace, and do not look back. Terror is on every side, says Jehovah.
\[6]Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape. In the north by the river Euphrates they have stumbled and fallen.
\[7]Who is this that rises up like the Nile, whose waters toss themselves like the rivers?
\[8]Egypt rises up like the Nile, and his waters toss themselves like the rivers. And he says, I will rise up. I will cover the earth. I will destroy cities and the inhabitants thereof.
\[9]Go up, ye horses, and rage, ye chariots. And let the mighty men go forth: Cush and Put, who handle the shield, and the Ludim, who handle and bend the bow.
\[10]For that day is a day of the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries. And the sword shall devour and be satiate, and shall drink its fill of their blood, for the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, has a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.
\[11]Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt. In vain do thou use many medicines; there is no healing for thee.
\[12]The nations have heard of thy shame, and the earth is full of thy cry. For the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty; they are fallen, both of them together.
\[13]The word that Jehovah spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, how that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt.
\[14]Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes. Say ye, Stand forth, and prepare thee, for the sword has devoured round about thee.
\[15]Why are thy strong ones swept away? They stood not, because Jehovah drove them.
\[16]He made many to stumble, yea, they fell one upon another. And they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.
\[17]They cried there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise. He has let the appointed time pass by.
\[18]As I live, says the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts, surely like Tabor among the mountains, and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.
\[19]O thou daughter who dwells in Egypt, prepare thyself to go into captivity. For Memphis shall become a desolation, and shall be burnt up, without inhabitant.
\[20]Egypt is a very fair heifer, but destruction out of the north has come, it has come.
\[21]Also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall, for they also are turned back. They have fled away together. They did not stand, for the day of their calamity has come upon them, the time of their visitation.
\[22]The sound thereof shall go like the serpent, for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.
\[23]They shall cut down her forest, says Jehovah, though it cannot be searched because they are more than the locusts, and are innumerable.
\[24]The daughter of Egypt shall be put to shame. She shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.
\[25]Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, says, Behold, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings, even Pharaoh, and those who trust in him.
\[26]And I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants. And afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, says Jehovah.
\[27]But fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, nor be dismayed, O Israel. For, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity. And Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.
\[28]Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, says Jehovah, for I am with thee. For I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven thee, but I will not make a full end of thee. But I will correct thee in measure, and will in no way leave thee unpunished.

he word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh smote Gaza.
\[2]Thus says Jehovah: Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall become an overflowing stream, and shall overflow the land and all that is therein, the city and those who dwell therein. And the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail
\[3]at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels. The fathers do not look back to their sons for feebleness of hands,
\[4]because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains. For Jehovah will destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphtor.
\[5]Baldness has come upon Gaza. Ashkelon is brought to naught, the remnant of their valley. How long will thou cut thyself?
\[6]O thou sword of Jehovah, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? Put up thyself into thy scabbard. Rest, and be still.
\[7]How can thou be quiet, since Jehovah has given thee a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea-shore. He has appointed it there.

f Moab. Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Woe to Nebo! For it is laid waste. Kiriathaim is put to shame; it is taken. Misgab is put to shame and broken down.
\[2]The praise of Moab is no more. In Heshbon they have devised evil against her: Come, and let us cut her off from being a nation. Thou also, O madmen, shall be brought to silence. The sword shall pursue thee.
\[3]The sound of a cry from Horonaim: Desolation and great destruction!
\[4]Moab is destroyed. Her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
\[5]For they shall go up by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping, for at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.
\[6]Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
\[7]For, because thou have trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou also shall be taken. And Chemosh shall go forth into captivity, his priests and his rulers together.
\[8]And the destroyer shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape. The valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as Jehovah has spoken.
\[9]Give wings to Moab, that she may fly and get her away. And her cities shall become a desolation, without any to dwell therein.
\[10]Cursed be he who does the work of Jehovah negligently, and cursed be he who keeps back his sword from blood.
\[11]Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees, and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, nor has he gone into captivity. Therefore his taste remains in him, and his scent is not changed.
\[12]Therefore, behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that I will send to him those who pour off, and they shall pour him off. And they shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles in pieces.
\[13]And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.
\[14]How can ye say, We are mighty men, and valiant men for the war?
\[15]Moab is laid waste, and they have gone up into his cities. And his chosen young men have gone down to the slaughter, says the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.
\[16]The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hastens fast.
\[17]All ye who are round about him, bemoan him, and all ye who know his name, say, How the strong staff has broken, the beautiful rod!
\[18]O thou daughter who dwells in Dibon, come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst, for the destroyer of Moab has come up against thee. He has destroyed thy strongholds.
\[19]O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and watch. Ask him who flees, and her who escapes. Say, What has been done?
\[20]Moab is put to shame, for it is broken down. Wail and cry, tell ye it by the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.
\[21]And judgment has come upon the plain country: upon Holon, and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath,
\[22]and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim,
\[23]and upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon,
\[24]and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.
\[25]The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, says Jehovah.
\[26]Make ye him drunken, for he magnified himself against Jehovah. And Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.
\[27]For was not Israel a derision to thee? Was he found among thieves? For as often as thou speak of him, thou wag the head.
\[28]O ye inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of an abyss.
\[29]We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud, his loftiness, and his pride, and his arrogance, and the haughtiness of his heart.
\[30]I know his wrath, says Jehovah, that it is nothing. His boastings have wrought nothing.
\[31]Therefore I will wail for Moab, yea, I will cry out for all Moab. For they shall mourn the men of Kir-heres.
\[32]With more than the weeping of Jazer I will weep for thee, O vine of Sibmah. Thy branches passed over the sea. They reached even to the sea of Jazer. The destroyer has fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.
\[33]And gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab. And I have caused wine to cease from the winepresses. None shall tread with shouting. The shouting shall be no shouting.
\[34]From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh, even to Jahaz they have uttered their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim, to Eglath-shelishiyah. For the waters of Nimrim also shall become desolate.
\[35]Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, says Jehovah, him who offers in the high place, and him who burns incense to his gods.
\[36]Therefore my heart sounds for Moab like pipes, and my heart sounds like pipes for the men of Kir-heres. Therefore the abundance that he has gotten is perished.
\[37]For every head is bald, and every beard clipped. Upon all the hands are cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.
\[38]On all the housetops of Moab and in the streets thereof there is lamentation everywhere. For I have broken Moab like a vessel of which none delights, says Jehovah.
\[39]How it is broken down! How they do wail! How Moab has turned the back with shame! So Moab shall become a derision and a horror to all who are round about him.
\[40]For thus says Jehovah: Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread out his wings against Moab.
\[41]Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds are seized, and the heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
\[42]And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he has magnified himself against Jehovah.
\[43]Fear and the pit and the snare are upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, says Jehovah.
\[44]He who flees from the fear shall fall into the pit, and he who gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare. For I will bring upon him, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, says Jehovah.
\[45]Those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon. For a fire has gone forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and has devoured the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
\[46]Woe to thee, O Moab! The people of Chemosh is undone, for thy sons are taken away captive, and thy daughters into captivity.
\[47]Yet I will bring back the captivity of Moab in the latter days, says Jehovah. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.

oncerning the sons of Ammon. Thus says Jehovah: Has Israel no sons? Has he no heir? Why then does Malcam possess Gad, and his people dwell in the cities thereof?
\[2]Therefore, behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and it shall become a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire. Then Israel shall possess those who possessed him, says Jehovah.
\[3]Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste. Cry, ye daughters of Rabbah. Gird you with sackcloth. Lament, and run to and fro among the fences. For Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his rulers together.
\[4]Why do thou glory in the valleys, thy flowing valley? O backsliding daughter, who trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come to me?
\[5]Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, from all who are round about thee. And ye shall be driven out every man straight forth, and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives.
\[6]But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the sons of Ammon, says Jehovah.
\[7]Of Edom. Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom vanished?
\[8]Flee ye, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan. For I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I shall visit him.
\[9]If grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? If thieves by night, would they not destroy till they had enough?
\[10]But I have made Esau bare. I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself. His seed is destroyed, and his brothers, and his neighbors, and he is not.
\[11]Leave thy fatherless sons; I will preserve them alive. And let thy widows trust in me.
\[12]For thus says Jehovah: Behold, those to whom it did not pertain to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink. And are thou he who shall go altogether unpunished? Thou shall not go unpunished, but thou shall surely drink.
\[13]For I have sworn by myself, says Jehovah, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse, and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.
\[14]I have heard news from Jehovah. And an ambassador is sent among the nations, saying, Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.
\[15]For, behold, I have made thee small among the nations, and despised among men.
\[16]As for thy formidableness, the pride of thy heart has deceived thee, O thou who dwells in the clefts of the rock, who holds the height of the hill. Though thou should make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from there, says Jehovah.
\[17]And Edom shall become an astonishment. Everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues of it.
\[18]As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, says Jehovah, no man shall dwell there, nor shall any son of man sojourn in it.
\[19]Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation. For I will suddenly make them run away from it. And he who is chosen, him I will appoint over it. For who is like me, and who will appoint a time for me, and who is the shepherd who will stand before me?
\[20]Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah that he has taken against Edom, and his purposes, that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall drag them away, even the little ones of the flock. Surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.
\[21]The earth trembles at the noise of their fall. There is a cry; the noise of it is heard in the Red Sea.
\[22]Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah. And the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
\[23]Of Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad, for they have heard evil news. They are melted away. There is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.
\[24]Damascus has grown feeble. She turns herself to flee, and trembling has seized on her. Anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.
\[25]How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy?
\[26]Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, says Jehovah of hosts.
\[27]And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.
\[28]Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote. Thus says Jehovah: Arise ye. Go up to Kedar, and destroy the sons of the east.
\[29]They shall take their tents and their flocks. They shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels. And they shall cry to them, Terror on every side!
\[30]Flee ye. Wander far off. Dwell in the depths, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, says Jehovah. For Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you, and has conceived a purpose against you.
\[31]Arise, get you up to a nation that is at ease, that dwells without worry, says Jehovah, that has neither gates nor bars, that dwells alone.
\[32]And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil. And I will scatter to all winds those who have the corners of their hair cut off. And I will bring their calamity from every side of them, says Jehovah.
\[33]And Hazor shall be a dwelling-place of jackals, a desolation forever. No man shall dwell there, nor shall any son of man sojourn therein.

\[35]Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.
\[36]And upon Elam I will bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds. And there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.
\[37]And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before those who seek their life. And I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, says Jehovah. And I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them.
\[38]And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from there king and rulers, says Jehovah.
\[39]But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, says Jehovah.

he word that Jehovah spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet.
\[2]Declare ye among the nations and publish, and set up a standard, publish, and conceal not. Say, Babylon is taken. Bel is put to shame. Merodach is dismayed. Her images are put to shame; her idols are dismayed.
\[3]For out of the north there comes up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein. They are fled. They are gone, both man and beast.
\[4]In those days, and in that time, says Jehovah, the sons of Israel shall come, they and the sons of Judah together. They shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek Jehovah their God.
\[5]They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces toward it, saying, Come ye, and join yourselves to Jehovah in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten.
\[6]My people have been lost sheep. Their shepherds have caused them to go astray. They have turned them away on the mountains. They have gone from mountain to hill. They have forgotten their resting-place.
\[7]All who found them have devoured them, and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Jehovah, the habitation of righteousness, even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers.
\[8]Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flocks.
\[9]For, lo, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country, and they shall set themselves in array against her. From there she shall be taken. Their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man; none shall return in vain.
\[10]And Chaldea shall be a prey. All who prey upon her shall be satisfied, says Jehovah.
\[11]Because ye are glad, because ye rejoice, O ye who plunder my heritage, because ye are wanton as a heifer that treads out the grain, and neigh as strong horses,
\[12]your mother shall be utterly put to shame. She who bore you shall be confounded. Behold, she shall be the hindermost of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
\[13]Because of the wrath of Jehovah she shall not be inhabited, but she shall be wholly desolate. Everyone who goes by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.
\[14]Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all ye who bend the bow. Shoot at her; spare no arrows. For she has sinned against Jehovah.
\[15]Shout against her round about. She has submitted herself. Her bulwarks are fallen. Her walls are thrown down. For it is the vengeance of Jehovah. Take vengeance upon her. As she has done, do to her.
\[16]Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest. For fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn each one to his people, and they shall flee each one to his own land.
\[17]Israel is a hunted sheep, the lions have driven him away. First, the king of Assyria devoured him, and now at last Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones.
\[18]Therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.
\[19]And I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.
\[20]In those days, and in that time, says Jehovah, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none, and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found. For I will pardon those whom I leave as a remnant.
\[21]Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod. Kill and utterly destroy after them, says Jehovah, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.
\[22]A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.
\[23]How the hammer of the whole earth is cut apart and broken! How Babylon has become a desolation among the nations!
\[24]I have laid a snare for thee, and thou are also taken, O Babylon, and thou were not aware. Thou are found, and also caught, because thou have striven against Jehovah.
\[25]Jehovah has opened his armory, and has brought forth the weapons of his indignation, for the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, has a work in the land of the Chaldeans.
\[26]Come against her from the utmost border. Open her store-houses. Cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be left.
\[27]Kill all her bullocks. Let them go down to the slaughter. Woe to them! For their day has come, the time of their visitation.
\[28]The voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God, the vengeance of his temple.
\[29]Call together the archers against Babylon, all those who bend the bow. Encamp against her round about; let none thereof escape. Recompense her according to her work. According to all that she has done, do to her. For she has been proud against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel.
\[30]Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, says Jehovah.
\[31]Behold, I am against thee, O thou proud one, says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, for thy day has come, the time that I will visit thee.
\[32]And the proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up. And I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all who are round about him.
\[33]Thus says Jehovah of hosts: The sons of Israel and the sons of Judah are oppressed together, and all who took them captive hold them firm; they refuse to let them go.
\[34]Their Redeemer is strong. Jehovah of hosts is his name. He will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
\[35]A sword is upon the Chaldeans, says Jehovah, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her rulers, and upon her wise men.
\[36]A sword is upon the boasters, and they shall become fools. A sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.
\[37]A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mixed people who are in the midst of her, and they shall become as women. A sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed.
\[38]A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up. For it is a land of graven images, and they are mad over idols.
\[39]Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein. And it shall no more be inhabited forever, nor shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
\[40]As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, says Jehovah, so shall no man dwell there, nor shall any son of man sojourn in it.
\[41]Behold, a people comes from the north, and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the outermost parts of the earth.
\[42]They lay hold on bow and spear. They are cruel, and have no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride upon horses, each one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
\[43]The king of Babylon has heard the news of them, and his hands grow feeble. Anguish has taken hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.
\[44]Behold, the enemy shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation. For I will suddenly make them run away from it, and he who is chosen, him I will appoint over it. For who is like me, and who will appoint a time for me, and who is the shepherd who can stand before me?
\[45]Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, that he has taken against Babylon, and his purposes, that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away, even the little ones of the flock. Surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.

\[3]Against him who bends let the archer bend his bow, and against him who lifts himself up in his coat of mail. And spare ye not her young men. Destroy ye utterly all her host.
\[4]And they shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and thrust through in her streets.
\[5]For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah, of his God, of Jehovah of hosts, though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.
\[6]Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save every man his life. Be not cut off in her iniquity, for it is the time of Jehovah's vengeance; he will render to her a recompense.
\[7]Babylon has been a golden cup in Jehovah's hand, that made all the earth drunken. The nations have drunk of her wine, therefore the nations are mad.
\[8]Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed. Wail for her. Take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.
\[9]We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed. Forsake her, and let us go each one into his own country. For her judgment reaches to heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.
\[10]Jehovah has brought forth our righteousness. Come, and let us declare in Zion the work of Jehovah our God.
\[11]Make sharp the arrows. Hold firm the shields. Jehovah has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes, because his purpose is against Babylon, to destroy it. For it is the vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance of his temple.
\[12]Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon. Make the watch strong. Set the watchmen. Prepare the ambushes. For Jehovah has both purposed and done that which he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.
\[13]O thou who dwell upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end has come, the measure of thy covetousness.
\[14]Jehovah of hosts has sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men as with the canker-worm, and they shall lift up a shout against thee.
\[15]He has made the earth by his power. He has established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding he has stretched out the heavens.
\[16]When he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings for the rain, and brings forth the wind out of his treasuries.
\[17]Every man has become brutish, without knowledge. Every goldsmith is put to shame by his image, for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
\[18]They are vanity, a work of delusion. In the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\[19]The portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the former of all things, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance. Jehovah of hosts is his name.
\[20]Thou are my battle-axe and weapons of war. And with thee I will break in pieces the nations, and with thee I will destroy kingdoms,
\[21]and with thee I will break in pieces the horse and his rider,
\[22]and with thee I will break in pieces the chariot and him who rides in it, and with thee I will break in pieces man and woman, and with thee I will break in pieces the old man and the youth, and with thee I will break in pieces the young man and the virgin,
\[23]and with thee I will break in pieces the shepherd and his flock, and with thee I will break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen, and with thee I will break in pieces governors and deputies.
\[24]And I will render to Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, says Jehovah.
\[25]Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, says Jehovah, which destroys all the earth. And I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.
\[26]And they shall not take from thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations, but thou shall be desolate forever, says Jehovah.
\[27]Set ye up a standard in the land. Blow the trumpet among the nations. Prepare the nations against her. Call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz. Appoint a marshal against her. Cause the horses to come up as the rough canker-worm.
\[28]Prepare against her the nations, the kings of the Medes, the governors of it, and all the deputies of it, and all the land of their dominion.
\[29]And the land trembles and is in pain, for the purposes of Jehovah against Babylon stand, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.
\[30]The mighty men of Babylon have ceased fighting; they remain in their strongholds. Their might has failed. They have become as women. Her dwelling-places are set on fire. Her bars are broken.
\[31]One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to met another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter.
\[32]And the passages are seized, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are frightened.
\[33]For thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor at the time when it is trodden. Yet a little while, and the time of harvest shall come for her.
\[34]Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me. He has crushed me. He has made me an empty vessel. He has, like a monster, swallowed me up. He has filled his stomach with my delicacies. He has cast me out.
\[35]The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, the inhabitant of Zion shall say. And, My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, Jerusalem shall say.
\[36]Therefore thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee. And I will dry up her sea, and make her fountain dry.
\[37]And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling-place for jackals, an astonishment, and a hissing, without inhabitant.
\[38]They shall roar together like young lions. They shall growl as lions' whelps.
\[39]When they are heated, I will make their feast. And I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, says Jehovah.
\[40]I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats.
\[41]How Sheshach is taken, and the praise of the whole earth seized! How Babylon has become a desolation among the nations!
\[42]The sea has come up upon Babylon. She is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.
\[43]Her cities have become a desolation, a dry land, and a desert, a land in which no man dwells, nor does any son of man pass thereby.
\[44]And I will execute judgment upon Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up. And the nations shall not flow any more to him. Yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.
\[45]My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and save yourselves each man from the fierce anger of Jehovah.
\[46]And let not your heart faint. Neither fear ye for the news that shall be heard in the land. For news shall come one year, and after that in another year, news, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.
\[47]Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will execute judgment upon the graven images of Babylon. And her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
\[48]Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for joy over Babylon. For the destroyers shall come to her from the north, says Jehovah.
\[49]As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the land.
\[50]Ye who have escaped the sword, go ye; do not stand still. Remember Jehovah from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
\[51]We are confounded, because we have heard reproach. Confusion has covered our faces. For strangers have come into the sanctuaries of Jehovah's house.
\[52]Therefore, behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that I will execute judgment upon her graven images, and through all her land the wounded shall groan.
\[53]Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me destroyers shall come to her, says Jehovah.
\[54]The sound of a cry from Babylon, and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
\[55]For Jehovah lays Babylon waste, and destroys the great voice out of her, and their waves roar like many waters; the noise of their voice is uttered.
\[56]For the destroyer has come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken. Their bows are broken in pieces. For Jehovah is a God of recompenses; he will surely requite.
\[57]And I will make drunk her rulers and her wise men, her governors and her deputies, and her mighty men. And they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, says the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.
\[58]Thus says Jehovah of hosts: The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates shall be burned with fire. And the peoples shall labor for vanity, and the nations for the fire, and they shall be weary.
\[59]The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain.
\[60]And Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that would come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.
\[61]And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou come to Babylon, then see that thou read all these words.
\[62]And say, O Jehovah, thou have spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate forever.
\[63]And it shall be, when thou have made an end of reading this book, that thou shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates.
\[64]And thou shall say, Thus Babylon shall sink, and shall not rise again because of the evil that I will bring upon her, and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.

edekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\[2]And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
\[3]For it came to pass through the anger of Jehovah, in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
\[4]And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army against Jerusalem, and encamped against it. And they built forts against it round about.
\[5]So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
\[6]In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
\[7]Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden, (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about), and they went toward the Arabah.
\[8]But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him.
\[9]Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he gave judgment upon him.
\[10]And the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. He also killed all the rulers of Judah in Riblah.
\[11]And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah. And the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
\[12]Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem.
\[13]And he burned the house of Jehovah, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem. Even every great house, he burned with fire.
\[14]And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
\[15]Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude.
\[16]But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.
\[17]And the pillars of brass that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of Jehovah, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
\[18]The pots also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, they took away.
\[19]And the cups, and the fire pans, and the basins, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the spoons, and the bowls-that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver-the captain of the guard took away.
\[20]The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah-the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
\[21]And as for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a line of twelve cubits encompassed it, and the thickness of it was four fingers; it was hollow.
\[22]And a capital of brass was upon it. And the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass. And the second pillar also had like these, and pomegranates.
\[23]And there were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides. All the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network round about.
\[24]And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold.
\[25]And from the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war, and seven men of those who saw the king's face, who were found in the city, and the scribe of the captain of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city.
\[26]And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
\[27]And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.
\[28]This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: In the seventh year three thousand twenty-three Jews.
\[29]In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons.
\[30]In the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty-five persons. All the persons were four thousand six hundred.
\[31]And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty-fifth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison.
\[32]And he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon,
\[33]and changed his prison garments. And he ate bread before him continually all the days of his life.
\[34]And for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.

ow the city sits solitary, that was full of people! She has become as a widow, who was great among the nations! She who was a princess among the provinces has become tributary!
\[2]She weeps bitterly in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks. Among all her loved ones she has none to comfort her. All her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they have become her enemies.
\[3]Judah has gone into captivity because of affliction. And because of great servitude she dwells among the nations. She finds no rest. All her persecutors overtook her in the distress.
\[4]The ways of Zion mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly. All her gates are desolate. Her priests sigh. Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.
\[5]Her adversaries have become the head. Her enemies prosper. For Jehovah has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions. Her young sons have gone into captivity before the adversary.
\[6]And from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed. Her rulers have become like harts that find no pasture. And they have gone without strength before the pursuer.
\[7]Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old. When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none helped her, the adversaries saw her; they mocked at her desolations.
\[8]Jerusalem has grievously sinned, therefore she has become as an unclean thing. All who honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness. Yea, she sighs, and turns backward.
\[9]Her filthiness was in her skirts. She did not think of her latter end. Therefore she has come down astonishingly. She has no comforter. Behold, O Jehovah, my affliction, for the enemy has magnified himself.
\[10]The adversary has spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things. For she has seen that the nations have entered into her sanctuary, concerning whom thou commanded that they should not enter into thine assembly.
\[11]All her people sigh. They seek bread. They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul. See, O Jehovah, and, behold, for I have become abject.
\[12]Is it nothing to you, all ye who pass by? Behold, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, which is brought upon me. Therewith Jehovah has afflicted in the day of his fierce anger.
\[13]From on high he has sent fire into my bones, and it prevails against them. He has spread a net for my feet. He has turned me back. He has made me desolate and faint all the day.
\[14]The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand. They are knit together. They have come up upon my neck. He has made my strength to fail. The Lord has delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand.
\[15]The Lord has trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me. He has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men. The Lord has trodden the virgin daughter of Judah as in a winepress.
\[16]For these things I weep. My eye, my eye runs down with water, because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me. My sons are desolate, because the enemy has prevailed.
\[17]Zion spreads forth her hands. There is none to comfort her. Jehovah has commanded concerning Jacob, that those who are round about him should be his adversaries. Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.
\[18]Jehovah is righteous, for I have rebelled against his commandment. Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow. My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity.
\[19]I called for my loved ones, but they deceived me. My priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city, while they sought food for themselves to refresh their souls.
\[20]Behold, O Jehovah, for I am in distress. My heart is troubled. My heart is turned within me. For I have grievously rebelled. Abroad the sword bereaves; at home there is as death.
\[21]They have heard that I sigh. There is none to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my trouble. They are glad that thou have done it. Thou will bring the day that thou have proclaimed, and they shall be like me.
\[22]Let all their wickedness come before thee, and do to them, as thou have done to me for all my transgressions. For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.

ow the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger! He has cast down the beauty of Israel from heaven to the earth, and has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
\[2]The Lord has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and has not pitied. In his wrath he has thrown down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah. He has brought them down to the ground. He has profaned the kingdom and the rulers thereof.
\[3]In fierce anger he has cut off all the horn of Israel. He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy. And he has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire which devours round about.
\[4]He has bent his bow like an enemy. He has stood with his right hand as an adversary, and has slain all who were pleasant to the eye. He has poured out his wrath like fire in the tent of the daughter of Zion.
\[5]The Lord has become as an enemy. He has swallowed up Israel. He has swallowed up all her palaces. He has destroyed his strongholds. And he has multiplied mourning and lamentation in the daughter of Judah.
\[6]And he has taken away his tabernacle violently, as a garden. He has destroyed his place of assembly. Jehovah has caused solemn assembly and sabbath to be forgotten in Zion. And in the indignation of his anger has despised the king and the priest.
\[7]The Lord has cast off his altar. He has abhorred his sanctuary. He has given up the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy. They have made a noise in the house of Jehovah, as in the day of a solemn assembly.
\[8]Jehovah has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion. He has stretched out the line. He has not withdrawn his hand from destroying. And he has made the rampart and wall to lament, they languish together.
\[9]Her gates are sunk into the ground. He has destroyed and broken her bars. Her king and her rulers are among the nations where the law is not. Yea, her prophets find no vision from Jehovah.
\[10]The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground. They keep silence. They have cast up dust upon their heads. They have girded themselves with sackcloth. The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
\[11]My eyes fail with tears, my heart is troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, because the young sons and the sucklings faint in the streets of the city.
\[12]They say to their mothers, Where is grain and wine? when they faint as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul is poured out into their mothers' bosom.
\[13]What shall I testify to thee? What shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I compare to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? For thy breach is great like the sea; who can heal thee?
\[14]Thy prophets have seen false and foolish visions for thee. And they have not uncovered thine iniquity, to bring back thy captivity, but have seen for thee false oracles and causes of banishment.
\[15]All who pass by clap their hands at thee. They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?
\[16]All thine enemies have opened their mouth wide against thee. They hiss and gnash the teeth. They say, We have swallowed her up. Certainly this is the day that we looked for. We have found, we have seen it.
\[17]Jehovah has done that which he purposed. He has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old. He has thrown down, and has not pitied. And he has caused the enemy to rejoice over thee. He has exalted the horn of thine adversaries.
\[18]Their heart cried to the Lord. O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night. Give thyself no respite. Let not the apple of thine eye cease.
\[19]Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches. Pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord. Lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young sons, who faint for hunger at the head of every street.
\[20]See, O Jehovah, and behold to whom thou have done thus! Shall the women eat their fruit, the sons who are dandled in the hands? Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?
\[21]The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets. My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword. Thou have slain them in the day of thine anger. Thou have slaughtered, and not pitied.
\[22]Thou have called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side. And there was none who escaped or remained in the day of Jehovah's anger. My enemy has consumed those whom I have dandled and brought up.

\[23]They are new every morning. Great is thy faithfulness.

\[28]Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he has laid it upon him.
\[29]Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.
\[30]Let him give his cheek to him who smites him. Let him be filled full with reproach.
\[31]For the Lord will not cast off forever.
\[32]For though he causes grief, yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.
\[33]For he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the sons of men.
\[34]To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,
\[35]to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,
\[36]to subvert a man in his cause, the Lord does not approve.

\[50]till Jehovah looks down, and beholds from heaven.
\[51]My eye stirs my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.
\[52]They have chased me grievously like a bird, those who are my enemies without cause.
\[53]They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone upon me.
\[54]Waters flowed over my head. I said, I am cut off.
\[55]I called upon thy name, O Jehovah, out of the lowest dungeon.
\[56]Thou heard my voice. Hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
\[57]Thou drew near in the day that I called upon thee. Thou said, Fear not.

\[14]They wander as blind men in the streets. They are polluted with blood, so that men cannot touch their garments.
\[15]Depart ye, they cried to them. Unclean! Depart, depart, do not touch! When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They shall no more sojourn here.
\[16]The anger of Jehovah has scattered them. He will no more regard them. They did not respect the persons of the priests. They did not favor the elders.

\[3]the word of Jehovah came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar, and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him.
\[4]And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst of it, as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.
\[5]And out of the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance. They had the likeness of a man.
\[6]And each one had four faces, and each one of them had four wings.
\[7]And their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot, and they sparkled like burnished brass.
\[8]And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides. And those four had their faces and their wings thus:
\[9]Their wings were joined one to another. They did not turn when they went; they went each one straight forward.
\[10]As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man. And those four had the face of a lion on the right side, and those four had the face of an ox on the left side, those four also had the face of an eagle.
\[11]And their faces and their wings were separate above, two wings of each one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
\[12]And they went each one straight forward. Where the spirit was to go, they went. They did not turn when they went.
\[13]As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. It went up and down among the living creatures, and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
\[14]And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
\[15]Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, one wheel was upon the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces of it.
\[16]The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl. And those four had one likeness, and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.
\[17]When they went, they went in their four directions. They did not turn when they went.
\[18]As for their rims, they were high and fearful. And those four had their rims full of eyes round about.
\[19]And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them. And when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
\[20]Wherever the spirit was to go, they went; there the spirit was to go. And the wheels were lifted up beside them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\[21]When those went, these went, and when those stood, these stood, and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\[22]And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like awesome crystal to look upon, stretched forth over their heads above.
\[23]And under the firmament their wings were straight, the one toward the other. Each one had two which covered their bodies on this side, and each one had two which covered on that side.
\[24]And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host. When they stood, they let down their wings.
\[25]And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads. When they stood, they let down their wings.
\[26]And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone. And upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.
\[27]And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward. And from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire. And there was brightness round about him.
\[28]As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice speaking.

\[2]And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me upon my feet. And I heard him who spoke to me.
\[3]And he said to me, Son of man, I send thee to the sons of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day.
\[4]And the sons are impudent and stiff hearted. I send thee to them, and thou shall say to them, Thus says the lord Jehovah.
\[5]And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them.
\[6]And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and thou dwell among scorpions. Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
\[7]And thou shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are most rebellious.
\[8]But thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee. Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house. Open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.
\[9]And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth to me, and, lo, a roll of a book was in it,

\[3]And he said to me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
\[4]And he said to me, Son of man, go, get thee to the house of Israel, and speak to them with my words.
\[5]For thou are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel,
\[6]not to many peoples of a strange speech, and of a hard language, whose words thou cannot understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken to thee.
\[7]But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee, for they will not hearken to me. For all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and of a stiff heart.
\[8]Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.
\[9]As an adamant, harder than flint, I have made thy forehead. Fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
\[10]Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to thee, receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.
\[11]And go, get thee to those of the captivity, to the sons of thy people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus says the lord Jehovah, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
\[12]Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place.
\[13]And I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched each other, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.
\[14]So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away. And I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.
\[15]Then I came to those of the captivity at Tel-abib, who dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt. And I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.
\[16]And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[17]Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
\[18]When I say to a wicked man, Thou shall surely die, and thou give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked man from his wicked way, to save his life, the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at thy hand.
\[19]Yet if thou warn the wicked man, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity, but thou have delivered thy soul.
\[20]Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. Because thou have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered, but I will require his blood at thy hand.
\[21]Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous man not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning, and thou have delivered thy soul.
\[22]And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me, and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will talk with thee there.
\[23]Then I arose, and went forth into the plain. And, behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar, and I fell on my face.
\[24]Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet. And he spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.
\[25]But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shall not escape from them.
\[26]And I will make thy tongue cling to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shall be mute, and shall not be a reprover to them, for they are a rebellious house.
\[27]But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shall say to them, Thus says the lord Jehovah. He who hears, let him hear, and he who forbears, let him forbear, for they are a rebellious house.

\[3]And take thou to thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city. And set thy face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.
\[4]Moreover lie thou upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it. According to the number of the days that thou shall lie upon it, thou shall bear their iniquity.

\[6]And again, when thou have accomplished these, thou shall lie on thy right side, and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days, each day for a year. I have appointed it to thee.

\[13]And Jehovah said, Even thus shall the sons of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations where I will drive them.
\[14]Then I said, Ah lord Jehovah! Behold, my soul has not been polluted. For from my youth up even till now I have not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn of beasts, neither has abominable flesh come into my mouth.
\[15]Then he said to me, See, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shall prepare thy bread of it.

\[3]And thou shall take from it a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.

\[6]And she has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her, for they have rejected my ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.
\[7]Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Because ye are more disorderly than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, nor have kept my ordinances, no, ye have not even done according to the ordinances of the nations that are round about you,
\[8]therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and I will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.
\[9]And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and of which I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.
\[10]Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers. And I will execute judgments on thee, and I will scatter to all the winds the whole remnant of thee.
\[11]Therefore, as I live, says the lord Jehovah, surely, because thou have defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore I also will diminish thee, nor shall my eye spare. And I also will have no pity.
\[12]A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and they shall be consumed with famine in the midst of thee, and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee, and a third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.
\[13]Thus my anger shall be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I shall be comforted. And they shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath upon them.
\[14]Moreover I will make thee a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all who pass by.
\[15]So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, a lesson and an astonishment, to the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments on thee in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes-I, Jehovah, have spoken it-
\[16]when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you. And I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread.
\[17]And I will send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee. And pestilence and blood shall pass through thee. And I will bring the sword upon thee. I, Jehovah, have spoken it.

And they shall loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.

\[12]He who is far off shall die of the pestilence, and he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine. Thus I will accomplish my wrath upon them.

\[11]Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth. Neither shall there be eminency among them.

They shall not satisfy their souls, nor fill their bowels, because it has been the stumbling block of their iniquity.

\[21]And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil, and they shall profane it.
\[22]I will also turn my face from them, and they shall profane my secluded place. And robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.
\[23]Make the chain, for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.

\[25]Destruction comes. And they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.
\[26]Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor. And they shall seek a vision of the prophet, but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.

\[11]And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel. And in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, each man with his censer in his hand, and the odor of the cloud of incense went up.
\[12]Then he said to me, Son of man, have thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, each man in his chambers of imagery? For they say, Jehovah does not see us. Jehovah has forsaken the land.

And, behold, at the door of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah, and their faces toward the east, and they were worshiping the sun toward the east.

\[14]And each one had four faces. The first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third face the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
\[15]And the cherubim mounted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.
\[16]And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them. And when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also did not turn from beside them.
\[17]When they stood, these stood, and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them, for the spirit of the living creature was in them.
\[18]And the glory of Jehovah went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.
\[19]And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them. And they stood at the door of the east gate of Jehovah's house, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
\[20]This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar, and I knew that they were cherubim.
\[21]Each one had four faces, and each one four wings. And the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.
\[22]And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves. They went each one straight forward.

oreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of Jehovah's house, which looks eastward. And, behold, at the door of the gate twenty-five men. And I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, rulers of the people.
\[2]And he said to me, Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who give wicked counsel in this city,
\[3]who say, The time is not near to build houses. This city is the caldron, and we are the flesh.
\[4]Therefore prophesy against them. Prophesy, O son of man.
\[5]And the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and he said to me, Speak, Thus says Jehovah: Thus ye have said, O house of Israel, for I know the things that come into your mind.
\[6]Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.
\[7]Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron, but ye shall be brought forth out of the midst of it.
\[8]Ye have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, says the lord Jehovah.
\[9]And I will bring you forth out of the midst of it, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.
\[10]Ye shall fall by the sword. I will judge you in the border of Israel, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[11]This city shall not be your caldron, nor shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof. I will judge you in the border of Israel,
\[12]and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. For ye have not walked in my statutes, nor have ye executed my ordinances, but have done according to the ordinances of the nations that are round about you.
\[13]And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah lord Jehovah! Will thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?
\[14]And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[15]Son of man, thy brothers, even thy brothers, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, are those to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from Jehovah. This land is given to us for a possession.
\[16]Therefore say, Thus says the lord Jehovah: Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet I will be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they have come.
\[17]Therefore say, Thus says the lord Jehovah. I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
\[18]And they shall come there, and they shall take away from there all the detestable things of it and all the abominations of it.
\[19]And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. And I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh,
\[20]that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
\[21]But as for those whose heart walks according to the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way upon their own heads, says the lord Jehovah.
\[22]Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
\[23]And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.
\[24]And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to those of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.
\[25]Then I spoke to those of the captivity all the things that Jehovah had shown me.

he word of Jehovah also came to me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, thou dwell in the midst of the rebellious house, that have eyes to see, and see not, that have ears to hear, and hear not, for they are a rebellious house.
\[3]Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for moving, and move by day in their sight. And thou shall move from thy place to another place in their sight. It may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.
\[4]And thou shall bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for moving. And thou shall go forth thyself at evening in their sight, as when men go forth into exile.
\[5]Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out by that.
\[6]Thou shall bear it upon thy shoulder in their sight, and carry it forth in the dark. Thou shall cover thy face, that thou not see the land. For I have set thee for a sign to the house of Israel.
\[7]And I did so as I was commanded. I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for moving, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought it forth in the dark, and bore it upon my shoulder in their sight.
\[8]And in the morning the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[9]Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to thee, What are thou doing?
\[10]Say thou to them, Thus says the lord Jehovah: This burden concerns the ruler in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.
\[11]Say, I am your sign. Just as I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall go into exile, into captivity.
\[12]And the ruler who is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth. They shall dig through the wall to carry out by it. He shall cover his face, because he shall not see the land with his eyes.
\[13]I will also spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there.
\[14]And I will scatter toward every wind all who are round about him to help him, and all his groups. And I will draw out the sword after them.
\[15]And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.
\[16]But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they come. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[17]Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[18]Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with fearfulness.
\[19]And say to the people of the land, Thus says the lord Jehovah concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate of all that is in it, because of the violence of all those who dwell therein.
\[20]And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[21]And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[22]Son of man, what is this proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?
\[23]Tell them therefore, Thus says the lord Jehovah: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel, but say to them, The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision.
\[24]For there shall no more be any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.
\[25]For I am Jehovah. I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall be performed. It shall be no more deferred. For in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak the word, and will perform it, says the lord Jehovah.
\[26]Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[27]Son of man, behold, those of the house of Israel say, The vision that he sees is for many day to come, and he prophesies of times that are far off.
\[28]Therefore say to them, Thus says the lord Jehovah: There shall none of my words be deferred any more, but the word which I shall speak shall be performed, says the lord Jehovah.

nd the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say thou to those who prophesy out of their own heart, Hear ye the word of Jehovah.
\[3]Thus says the lord Jehovah: Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
\[4]O Israel, thy prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.
\[5]Ye have not gone up into the gaps, nor built up the wall for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of Jehovah.
\[6]They have seen falsehood and lying divination, who say, Jehovah says, but Jehovah has not sent them. And they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed.
\[7]Have ye not seen a false vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, in that ye say, Jehovah says, albeit I have not spoken?
\[8]Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Because ye have spoken falsehood, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, says the lord Jehovah.
\[9]And my hand shall be against the prophets who see false visions, and who divine lies. They shall not be in the council of my people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel. And ye shall know that I am the lord Jehovah.
\[10]Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace, and there is no peace, and when a man builds up a wall, behold, they daub it with untempered mortar,
\[11]say to those who daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall. There shall be an overflowing shower, and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall, and a stormy wind shall rend it.
\[12]Lo, when the wall has fallen, shall it not be said to you, Where is the daubing with which ye have daubed it?
\[13]Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my wrath, and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.
\[14]So I will break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be uncovered. And it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst of it. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[15]Thus I will accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon those who have daubed it with untempered mortar. And I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who daubed it,
\[16]namely, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, says the lord Jehovah.
\[17]And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, who prophesy out of their own heart, and prophesy thou against them.
\[18]And say, Thus says the lord Jehovah: Woe to the women who sew pillows upon all elbows, and make headdresses for the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves?
\[19]And ye have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls who should not die, and to save the souls alive who should not live, by your lying to my people who listen to lies.
\[20]Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against your pillows, with which ye hunt the souls there to make fly, and I will tear them from your arms. And I will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make fly.
\[21]I will also tear your headdresses, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall no more be in your hand to be hunted. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[22]Because with lies ye have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad, and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive.
\[23]Therefore ye shall no more see false visions, nor divine divinations. And I will deliver my people out of your hand. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah.

hen certain of the elders of Israel came to me, and sat before me.
\[2]And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[3]Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face. Should I be inquired of at all by them?
\[4]Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus says the lord Jehovah: Every man of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet, I Jehovah will answer him in it according to the multitude of his idols,
\[5]that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
\[6]Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the lord Jehovah: Return ye, and turn yourselves from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
\[7]For everyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel, that separates himself from me, and takes his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet to inquire for himself of me, I Jehovah will answer him by myself.
\[8]And I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb. And I will cut him off from the midst of my people. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[9]And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, Jehovah, have deceived that prophet. And I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
\[10]And they shall bear their iniquity. The iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him who seeks him,
\[11]that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, nor defile themselves any more with all their transgressions, but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, says the lord Jehovah.
\[12]And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[13]Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand upon it, and break the staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast,
\[14]though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, says the lord Jehovah.
\[15]If I cause evil beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the beasts,
\[16]though these three men were in it, as I live, says the lord Jehovah, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, they only would be delivered, but the land would be desolate.
\[17]Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land, so that I cut off from it man and beast,
\[18]though these three men were in it, as I live, says the lord Jehovah, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only would be delivered themselves.
\[19]Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast,
\[20]though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, says the lord Jehovah, they would deliver neither son nor daughter, they would but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.
\[21]For thus says the lord Jehovah: How much more when I send my four severe judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the evil beasts, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast!
\[22]Yet, behold, there shall be left a remnant in it that shall be carried forth, both sons and daughters. Behold, they shall come forth to you, and ye shall see their way and their doings. And ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.
\[23]And they shall comfort you when ye see their way and their doings. And ye shall know that I have not done all that I have done in it without cause, says the lord Jehovah.

\[4]Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel. The fire has devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it profitable for any work?
\[5]Behold, when it was whole, it was fit for no work. How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be fit for any work!

gain the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,
\[3]and say, Thus says the lord Jehovah to Jerusalem: Thy birth and thy nativity is from the land of the Canaanite. The Amorite was thy father, and thy mother was a Hittite.
\[4]And as for thy nativity, in the day thou were born thy navel was not cut, nor were thou washed in water to cleanse thee. Thou were not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.
\[5]No eye pitied thee, to do any of these things to thee, to have compassion upon thee, but thou were cast out in the open field. For thy person was abhorred, in the day that thou were born.
\[6]And when I passed by thee, and saw thee weltering in thy blood, I said to thee, in thy blood, Live! Yea, I said to thee, in thy blood, Live!
\[7]I caused thee to multiply as that which grows in the field, and thou increased and grew great. And thou attained to excellent ornament, thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair was grown. Yet thou were naked and bare.
\[8]Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love. And I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness. Yea, I swore to thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, says the lord Jehovah, and thou became mine.
\[9]Then I washed thee with water. Yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.
\[10]I also clothed thee with embroidered work, and shod thee with a certain skin. And I girded thee around with fine linen, and covered thee with silk.
\[11]And I decked thee with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.
\[12]And I put a ring upon thy nose, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.
\[13]Thus thou were decked with gold and silver, and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and embroidered work. Thou ate fine flour, and honey, and oil. And thou were very beautiful, and thou prospered to royalty.
\[14]And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty. For it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put upon thee, says the lord Jehovah.
\[15]But thou trusted in thy beauty, and played the harlot because of thy renown, and poured out thy whoredoms on everyone who passed by; his it was.
\[16]And thou took of thy garments, and made high places for thee, decked with various colors, and played the harlot upon them, things which should not come, nor should it be.
\[17]Thou also took thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and made for thee images of men, and played the harlot with them.
\[18]And thou took thy embroidered garments, and covered them, and set my oil and my incense before them.
\[19]My bread also which I gave thee, fine flour and oil and honey, with which I fed thee, thou even set it before them for a sweet savor, and thus it was, says the lord Jehovah.
\[20]Moreover thou have taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou have borne to me, and thou have sacrificed these to them to be devoured. Were thy whoredoms a small matter,
\[21]that thou have slain my children, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through the fire to them?
\[22]And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou have not remembered the days of thy youth when thou were naked and bare, and were weltering in thy blood.
\[23]And it has come to pass according to all thy wickedness, (woe, woe to thee! says the lord Jehovah),
\[24]that thou have built thyself a vaulted place, and have made thee a lofty place in every street.
\[25]Thou have built thy lofty place at the head of every way, and have made thy beauty an abomination. And have opened thy feet to everyone who passed by, and multiplied thy whoredom.
\[26]Thou have also committed fornication with the Egyptians, thy neighbors, great of flesh, and have multiplied thy whoredom, to provoke me to anger.
\[27]Behold therefore, I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thy portion, and delivered thee to the will of those who hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of thy lewd way.
\[28]Thou have played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because thou were insatiable. Yea, thou have played the harlot with them, and yet thou were not satisfied.
\[29]Thou have moreover multiplied thy whoredom to the land of traffic, to Chaldea, and yet thou were not satisfied with this.
\[30]How weak is thy heart, says the lord Jehovah, seeing thou do all these things, the work of an impudent harlot,
\[31]in that thou build thy vaulted place at the head of every way, and make thy lofty place in every street. And have not even been as a harlot, in that thou scorn hire.
\[32]A wife who commits adultery, who takes strangers instead of her husband!
\[33]They give gifts to all harlots, but thou give thy gifts to all thy lovers, and bribe them, that they may come to thee on every side for thy whoredoms.
\[34]And thou are different from other women in thy whoredoms, in that none follows thee to play the harlot. And whereas thou give a wage, and no wage is given to thee, therefore thou are different.
\[35]Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah.
\[36]Thus says the lord Jehovah: Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness uncovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and because of all the idols of thy abominations, and for the blood of thy sons, that thou gave to them,
\[37]therefore, behold, I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou have taken pleasure, and all those whom thou have loved, with all those whom thou have hated, I will even gather them against thee on every side. And I will uncover thy nakedness to them, that they may see all thy nakedness.
\[38]And I will judge thee, as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged. And I will bring upon thee the blood of wrath and jealousy.
\[39]I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thy vaulted place, and break down thy lofty places. And they shall strip thee of thy clothes, and take thy fair jewels, and they shall leave thee naked and bare.
\[40]They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.
\[41]And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women. And I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shall also give no wage any more.
\[42]So I will cause my wrath toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will no more be angry.
\[43]Because thou have not remembered the days of thy youth, but have raged against me in all these things, therefore, behold, I also will bring thy way upon thy head, says the lord Jehovah. And thou shall not commit this lewdness with all thine abominations.
\[44]Behold, everyone who uses proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.
\[45]Thou are the daughter of thy mother, who loathes her husband and her sons. And thou are the sister of thy sisters, who loathed their husbands and their sons. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
\[46]And thine elder sister is Samaria, who dwells at thy left hand, she and her daughters. And thy younger sister, who dwells at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.
\[47]Yet thou have not walked in their ways, nor done according to their abominations, but, like it was a very little thing, thou were more corrupt than they in all thy ways.
\[48]As I live, says the lord Jehovah, Sodom thy sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as thou have done, thou and thy daughters.
\[49]Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters, and she did not strengthen the hand of a poor and needy man.
\[50]And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me. Therefore I took them away as I saw fit.
\[51]Neither has Samaria committed half of thy sins, but thou have multiplied thine abominations more than they, and have justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou have done.
\[52]Thou also, bear thou thine own shame, in that thou have given judgment for thy sisters, through thy sins that thou have committed more abominable than they. They are more righteous than thou. Yea, be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, in that thou have justified thy sisters.
\[53]And I will turn back again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them,
\[54]that thou may bear thine own shame, and may be ashamed because of all that thou have done, in that thou are a comfort to them.
\[55]And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.
\[56]For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,
\[57]before thy wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all who are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, who do despite to thee round about.
\[58]Thou have borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, says Jehovah.
\[59]For thus says the lord Jehovah: I will also deal with thee as thou have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant.
\[60]Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish to thee an everlasting covenant.
\[61]Then thou shall remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shall receive thy sisters, thine elder sisters and thy younger, and I will give them to thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.
\[62]And I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shall know that I am Jehovah,
\[63]that thou may remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I have forgiven thee all that thou have done, says the lord Jehovah.

\[2]Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel,
\[3]and say, Thus says the lord Jehovah: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, full of feathers, which had various colors, came to Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar.
\[4]He cropped off the topmost of the young twigs of it, and carried it to a land of merchandise. He set it in a city of merchants.
\[5]He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil. He placed it beside many waters. He set it as a willow tree.
\[6]And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots of it were under him. So it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.
\[7]There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers. And, behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it.
\[8]It was planted in a good soil by many waters that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit that it might be a goodly vine.
\[9]Say thou, Thus says the lord Jehovah: Shall it flourish? Shall he not pull up the roots of it, and cut off the fruit of it, that it may wither? It shall wither in all its fresh springing leaves, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots of it.
\[10]Yea, behold, being planted, shall it flourish? Shall it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It shall wither in the beds where it grew.
\[11]Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[12]Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? Tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took the king of it, and the rulers of it, and brought them to him to Babylon.
\[13]And he took of the seed royal, and made a covenant with him. He also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land,
\[14]that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.
\[15]But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt that they might give him horses and many people. Shall he prosper? Shall he escape who does such things? Shall he break the covenant, and yet escape?
\[16]As I live, says the lord Jehovah, surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.
\[17]Nor shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war when they cast up mounds and build forts to cut off many persons.
\[18]For he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant. And, behold, he had given his hand, and yet has done all these things. He shall not escape.
\[19]Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: As I live, surely my oath that he has despised, and my covenant that he has broken, I will even bring it upon his own head.
\[20]And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me.
\[21]And all his fugitives in all his groups shall fall by the sword, and those who remain shall be scattered toward every wind. And ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
\[22]Thus says the lord Jehovah: I will also take of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it. I will crop off a tender one from the topmost of its young twigs, and I will plant it upon a high and lofty mountain.
\[23]I will plant it in the mountain of the height of Israel, and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar. And all birds of every wing shall dwell under it; they shall dwell in the shade of the branches thereof.
\[24]And all the trees of the field shall know that I, Jehovah, have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish. I, Jehovah, have spoken and have done it.

he word of Jehovah came to me again, saying,
\[2]What do ye mean, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the son's teeth are set on edge?
\[3]As I live, says the lord Jehovah, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.
\[4]Behold, all souls are mine, as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine. The soul that sins, it shall die.
\[5]But if a man be just, and does that which is lawful and right,
\[6]and has not eaten upon the mountains, nor has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, nor has defiled his neighbor's wife, nor has come near to a woman in her impurity,
\[7]and has not wronged any man, but has restored to the debtor his pledge, has taken nothing by robbery, has given his bread to a hungry man, and has covered a naked man with a garment,
\[8]he who has not given forth upon interest, nor has taken any increase, who has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, has executed true justice between man and man,
\[9]has walked in my statutes, and has kept my ordinances, to deal truly, he is just. He shall surely live, says the lord Jehovah.
\[10]If he begets a son who is a robber, a shedder of blood, and who does any one of these things,
\[11]and who does not do any of those duties, but has even eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbor's wife,
\[12]has wronged the poor and needy man, has taken by robbery, has not restored the pledge, and has lifted up his eyes to the idols, has committed abomination,
\[13]has given forth upon interest, and has taken increase, shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominations. He shall surely die. His blood shall be upon him.
\[14]Now, lo, if he begets a son, who sees all his father's sins, which he has done, and fears, and does not do such like,
\[15]who has not eaten upon the mountains, nor has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, has not defiled his neighbor's wife,
\[16]nor has wronged any man, has not taken anything to pledge, nor has taken by robbery, but has given his bread to a hungry man, and has covered a naked man with a garment,
\[17]who has withdrawn his hand from a poor man, who has not received interest nor increase, has executed my ordinances, has walked in my statutes, he shall not die for the iniquity of his father. He shall surely live.
\[18]As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he shall die in his iniquity.
\[19]Yet ye say, Why does not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live.
\[20]The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, nor shall the father bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of a righteous man shall be upon him, and the wickedness of a wicked man shall be upon him.
\[21]But if a wicked man turns from all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all my statutes, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live. He shall not die.
\[22]None of his transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him. In his righteousness that he has done he shall live.
\[23]Have I any pleasure in the death of a wicked man? says the lord Jehovah, and not rather that he should return from his way, and live?
\[24]But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that a wicked man does, shall he live? None of his righteous deeds that he has done shall be remembered. In his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them he shall die.
\[25]Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equitable. Hear now, O house of Israel. Is not my way equitable? Are not your ways inequitable?
\[26]When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies in it, in his iniquity that he has done, he shall die.
\[27]Again, when a wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.
\[28]Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live. He shall not die.
\[29]Yet the house of Israel says, The way of the Lord is not equitable. O house of Israel, are not my ways equitable? Are not your ways inequitable?
\[30]Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, each one according to his ways, says the lord Jehovah. Return ye, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions, so iniquity shall not be your ruin.
\[31]Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which ye have transgressed, and make you a new heart and a new spirit. For why will ye die, O house of Israel?
\[32]For I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies, says the lord Jehovah, therefore turn yourselves back, and live.

\[3]And she brought up one of her whelps. He became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey. He devoured men.
\[4]The nations also heard of him. He was taken in their pit, and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
\[5]Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.
\[6]And he went up and down among the lions. He became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey. He devoured men.
\[7]And he knew their palaces, and laid waste their cities. And the land was desolate, and the fullness of it, because of the noise of his roaring.
\[8]Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and they spread their net over him. He was taken in their pit.
\[9]And they put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon. They brought him into strongholds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
\[10]Thy mother was like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters. It was fruitful and full of branches because of many waters.
\[11]And it had strong twigs for the scepters of those who bore rule. And their stature was exalted among the thick boughs, and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches.
\[12]But it was plucked up in fury. It was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit. Its strong twigs were broken off and withered. The fire consumed them.
\[13]And now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.
\[14]And fire has gone out of the twigs of its branches. It has devoured its fruit, so that there is no strong twig in it to be a scepter to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.

nd it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Jehovah, and sat before me.
\[2]And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[3]Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the lord Jehovah: Is it to inquire of me that ye have come? As I live, says the lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.
\[4]Will thou judge them, son of man, will thou judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers,
\[5]and say to them, Thus says the lord Jehovah: In the day when I chose Israel, and swore to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, I am Jehovah your God,
\[6]I swore to them in that day, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.
\[7]And I said to them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am Jehovah your God.
\[8]But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken to me. They did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
\[9]But I worked for my name's sake (that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them) in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.
\[10]So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.
\[11]And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my ordinances, which if a man does, he shall live in them.
\[12]Moreover I also gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Jehovah who sanctifies them.
\[13]But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not walk in my statutes, and they rejected my ordinances, which if a man keeps, he shall live in them. And they greatly profaned my sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
\[14]But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.
\[15]Moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands,
\[16]because they rejected my ordinances, and did not walk in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths, for their heart went after their idols.
\[17]Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I did not destroy them, nor did I make a full end of them in the wilderness.
\[18]And I said to their sons in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers. Neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols.
\[19]I am Jehovah your God. Walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them,
\[20]and hallow my sabbaths, and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am Jehovah your God.
\[21]But the sons rebelled against me. They did not walk in my statutes, nor kept my ordinances to do them, which if a man does, he shall live in them. They profaned my sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
\[22]Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth.
\[23]Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries,
\[24]because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.
\[25]Moreover I also gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances in which they will not live.
\[26]And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that opens the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Jehovah.
\[27]Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the lord Jehovah: In this moreover your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
\[28]For when I had brought them into the land, which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering. There also they made their sweet savor, and they poured out there their drink offerings.
\[29]Then I said to them, What does the high place to which ye go mean? So the name of it is called Bamah to this day.
\[30]Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the lord Jehovah: Do ye pollute yourselves according to the manner of your fathers, and play ye the harlot according to their abominations?
\[31]And when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, do ye pollute yourselves with all your idols to this day? And shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, says the lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.
\[32]And that which comes into your mind shall not be at all, in that ye say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
\[33]As I live, says the lord Jehovah, surely with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, I will be king over you.
\[34]And I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries in which ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out,
\[35]and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples. And there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.
\[36]Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, says the lord Jehovah.
\[37]And I will cause you to pass under the rod. And I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
\[38]And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and those who transgress against me. I will bring them forth out of the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[39]As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the lord Jehovah: Go ye. Serve each one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken to me. But ye shall no more profane my holy name with your gifts, and with your idols.
\[40]For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, says the lord Jehovah, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them, serve me in the land. There I will accept them, and there I will require your offerings, and the first-fruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.
\[41]I will accept you as a sweet savor when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries in which ye have been scattered. And I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations.
\[42]And ye shall know that I am Jehovah when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country which I swore to give to your fathers.
\[43]And there ye shall remember your ways, and all your doings, by which ye have polluted yourselves. And ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.
\[44]And ye shall know that I am Jehovah when I have dealt with you for my name's sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, says the lord Jehovah.
\[45]And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[46]Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South.
\[47]And say to the forest of the South, Hear the word of Jehovah. Thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree. The flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burnt by it.
\[48]And all flesh shall see that I, Jehovah, have kindled it. It shall not be quenched.

\[3]And say to the land of Israel, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee. And will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.
\[4]Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore my sword shall go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north.
\[5]And all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath. It shall not return any more.
\[6]Sigh therefore, thou son of man. With the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness thou shall sigh before their eyes.
\[7]And it shall be, when they say to thee, Why do thou sigh? That thou shall say, Because of the news. For it comes, and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water. Behold, it comes, and it shall be done, says the lord Jehovah.
\[8]And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[9]Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says Jehovah: Say, A sword, a sword. It is sharpened, and also furbished.
\[10]It is sharpened that it may make a slaughter. It is polished that it may be as lightning. Shall we then make mirth? It scorns the scepter of my son, every tree.
\[11]And it is given to be polished, that it may be handled. The sword, it is sharpened, yea, it is polished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
\[12]Cry and wail, son of man, for it is upon my people. It is upon all the rulers of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with my people. Smite therefore upon thy thigh.
\[13]For there is a trial, and what if even the rod that scorns shall be no more? says the lord Jehovah.
\[14]Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thy hands together. And let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded. It is the sword of the great man who is deadly wounded, which enters into their chambers.
\[15]I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied. Ah! It is made as lightning. It is pointed for slaughter.
\[16]Gather thee together. Go to the right. Set thyself in array. Go to the left, wherever thy face is set.
\[17]I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest. I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
\[18]The word of Jehovah came to me again, saying,
\[19]Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways that the sword of the king of Babylon may come. Those two shall come forth out of one land. And mark out a place. Mark it out at the head of the way to the city.
\[20]Thou shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.
\[21]For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination. He shook the arrows to and fro. He consulted the teraphim. He looked in the liver.
\[22]In his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.
\[23]And it shall be to them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths to them. But he brings iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.
\[24]Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear, because ye have come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.
\[25]And thou, O deadly wounded wicked man, the ruler of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the iniquity of the end,
\[26]thus says the lord Jehovah: Remove the miter, and take off the crown. This shall be no more the same. Exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.
\[27]I will overturn, overturn, overturn it. This also shall be no more, until he comes whose right it is. And I will give it.
\[28]And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the lord Jehovah concerning the sons of Ammon, and concerning their reproach. And say thou, A sword, a sword is drawn. It is polished for the slaughter, to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning,
\[29]while they see for thee false visions, while they divine lies to thee, to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked who are deadly wounded, whose day has come in the time of the iniquity of the end.
\[30]Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where thou were created, in the land of thy birth, I will judge thee.
\[31]And I will pour out my indignation upon thee. I will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath, and I will deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, skilful to destroy.
\[32]Thou shall be for fuel to the fire. Thy blood shall be in the midst of the land. Thou shall no more be remembered. For I, Jehovah, have spoken it.

\[5]Those that are near, and those that are far from thee, shall mock thee, thou infamous one, full of tumult.
\[6]Behold, the rulers of Israel, each one according to his power, have been in thee to shed blood.
\[7]In thee they have made light of father and mother. In the midst of thee they have dealt with the sojourner by oppression. In thee they have wronged the fatherless and the widow.

\[26]Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things. They have made no distinction between the holy and the common, nor have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
\[27]Her rulers in the midst of it are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain.
\[28]And her prophets have daubed for them with untempered mortar, seeing false visions, and divining lies to them, saying, Thus says the lord Jehovah, when Jehovah has not spoken.
\[29]The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery. Yea, they have vexed the poor and needy man, and have oppressed the sojourner wrongfully.
\[30]And I sought for a man among them who should build up the wall, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none.

\[2]Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.
\[3]And they played the harlot in Egypt. They played the harlot in their youth. There their breasts were pressed, and there was handled the bosom of their virginity.
\[4]And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister. And they became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.
\[5]And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine, and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors,
\[6]who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.
\[7]And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them. And on whomever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself.
\[8]Neither has she left her whoredoms since Egypt. For in her youth they lie with her, and they handled the bosom of her virginity, and they poured out their whoredom upon her.
\[9]Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
\[10]These uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and her daughters, and they killed her with the sword. And she became a byword among women, for they executed judgments upon her.
\[11]And her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her doting than she, and in her whoredoms which were more than the whoredoms of her sister.
\[12]She doted upon the Assyrians, governors and rulers, her neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.
\[13]And I saw that she was defiled. They both took one way.
\[14]And she increased her whoredoms, for she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,
\[15]girded with belts upon their loins, with flowing turbans upon their heads, all of them rulers to look upon, according to the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their nativity.
\[16]And as soon as she saw them she doted upon them, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.
\[17]And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love. And they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them.
\[18]So she uncovered her whoredoms, and uncovered her nakedness. Then my soul was alienated from her, just as my soul was alienated from her sister.
\[19]Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, remembering the days of her youth in which she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
\[20]And she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
\[21]Thus thou called to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in the handling of thy bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts of thy youth.
\[22]Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side:
\[23]the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and rulers all of them, rulers and men of renown, all of them riding upon horses.
\[24]And they shall come against thee with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples. They shall set themselves against thee with buckler and shield and helmet round about. And I will commit the judgment to them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.
\[25]And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal with thee in fury. They shall take away thy nose and thine ears, and thy residue shall fall by the sword. They shall take thy sons and thy daughters, and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.
\[26]They shall also strip thee of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.
\[27]Thus I will make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom from the land of Egypt, so that thou shall not lift up thine eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.
\[28]For thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of those whom thou hate, into the hand of those from whom thy soul is alienated.
\[29]And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take away all thy labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare. And the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be uncovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
\[30]These things shall be done to thee, because thou have played the harlot after the nations, and because thou are polluted with their idols.
\[31]Thou have walked in the way of thy sister, therefore I will give her cup into thy hand.
\[32]Thus says the lord Jehovah: Thou shall drink of thy sister's cup, which is deep and large. Thou shall be laughed to scorn and had in derision. It contains much.
\[33]Thou shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.
\[34]Thou shall even drink it and drain it out. And thou shall gnaw the shards of it, and shall tear thy breasts, for I have spoken it, says the lord Jehovah.
\[35]Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Because thou have forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore thou also bear thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
\[36]Jehovah said moreover to me, Son of man, will thou judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations.
\[37]For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands. And with their idols they have committed adultery. And they have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through the fire for them to be devoured.
\[38]Moreover they have done this to me: They have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.
\[39]For when they had slain their sons to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it, and, lo, thus they have done in the midst of my house.
\[40]And furthermore ye have sent for men who come from far, to whom a messenger was sent. And, lo, they came, for whom thou washed thyself, painted thine eyes, and decked thyself with ornaments,
\[41]and sat upon a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon thou did set my incense and my oil.
\[42]And the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her. And with men of the common sort, were brought drunkards from the wilderness, and they put bracelets upon the hands of those two women, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.
\[43]Then I said of her who was old in adulteries, Now they will play the harlot with her, and she with them.
\[44]And they went in to her, as they go in to a harlot. So they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.
\[45]And righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands.
\[46]For thus says the lord Jehovah: I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed.
\[47]And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords. They shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.
\[48]Thus I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do according to your lewdness.
\[49]And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols. And ye shall know that I am the lord Jehovah.

gain, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this selfsame day; the king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this selfsame day.
\[3]And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus says the lord Jehovah: Set on the caldron. Set it on, and also pour water into it.
\[4]Gather the pieces of it into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.
\[5]Take the choice of the flock, and also a pile of wood for the bones under the caldron. Make it boil well, yea, let the bones of it be boiled in the midst of it.
\[6]Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city, to the caldron whose rust is therein, and whose rust has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece. No lot has fallen upon it.
\[7]For her blood is in the midst of her. She set it upon the bare rock. She did not pour it upon the ground to cover it with dust.
\[8]That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be covered.
\[9]Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.
\[10]Heap on the wood; make the fire hot. Boil the flesh well, and make the broth thick. And let the bones be burned.
\[11]Then set it empty upon the coals of it, that it may be hot, and the brass of it may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.
\[12]She has wearied herself with toil, yet her great scum does not go forth out of her, her scum by fire.
\[13]In thy filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed thee and thou were not cleansed, thou shall not be cleansed from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my wrath toward thee to rest.
\[14]I, Jehovah, have spoken it. It shall come to pass, and I will do it. I will not go back. I will neither spare, nor will I relent. According to thy ways, and according to thy doings, they shall judge thee, says the lord Jehovah.
\[15]Also the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[16]Son of man, behold, I take the desire of thine eyes away from thee with a stroke. Yet thou shall neither mourn nor weep. Neither shall thy tears run down.
\[17]Sigh, but not aloud. Make no mourning for the dead. Bind thy headdress upon thee, and put thy shoes upon thy feet. And do not cover thy lips, and do not eat the bread of men.
\[18]So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. And I did in the morning as I was commanded.
\[19]And the people said to me, Will thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou do so?
\[20]Then I said to them, The word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[21]Speak to the house of Israel, Thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul has compassion. And your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by the sword.
\[22]And ye shall do as I have done. Ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.
\[23]And your coverings shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet. Ye shall not mourn nor weep, but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another.
\[24]Thus Ezekiel shall be to you a sign, according to all that he has done ye shall do. When this comes, then ye shall know that I am the lord Jehovah.
\[25]And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that upon which they set their heart-their sons and their daughters-
\[26]that in that day he who escapes shall come to thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?
\[27]In that day thy mouth shall be opened to him who is escaped, and thou shall speak, and no more be mute. So thou shall be a sign to them, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

\[4]therefore, behold, I will deliver thee to the sons of the east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in thee, and make their dwellings in thee. They shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.
\[5]And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the sons of Ammon a couching-place for flocks. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[6]For thus says the lord Jehovah: Because thou have clapped thy hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the spite of thy soul against the land of Israel,
\[7]therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the nations. And I will cut thee off from the peoples, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries. I will destroy thee, and thou shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[8]Thus says the lord Jehovah: Because Moab and Seir say, Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations,
\[9]therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country-Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim-
\[10]open to the sons of the east, against the sons of Ammon. And I will give them for a possession, that the sons of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations.
\[11]And I will execute judgments upon Moab, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[12]Thus says the lord Jehovah: Because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them,
\[13]therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: I will stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it, and I will make it desolate. From Teman, even to Dedan they shall fall by the sword.
\[14]And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath. And they shall know my vengeance, says the lord Jehovah.
\[15]Thus says the lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with spite of soul to destroy with perpetual enmity,
\[16]therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.

\[2]Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken, the gate of the peoples. She has turned around to me. I shall be replenished, now that she is laid waste,
\[3]therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causes its waves to come up.
\[4]And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers. I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock.
\[5]She shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken it, says the lord Jehovah. And she shall become a spoil to the nations,
\[6]and her daughters who are in the field shall be slain with the sword. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[7]For thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring upon Tyre, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and a company, and many people.
\[8]He shall kill thy daughters in the field with the sword. And he shall make forts against thee, and cast up a mound against thee, and raise up the buckler against thee.
\[9]And he shall set his battering engines against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.
\[10]Because of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee. Thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city in which a breach is made.
\[11]With the hoofs of his horses he shall tread down all thy streets. He shall kill thy people with the sword, and the pillars of thy strength shall go down to the ground.
\[12]And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise. And they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses, and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the waters.
\[13]And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease, and the sound of thy harps shall no more be heard.
\[14]And I will make thee a bare rock; thou shall be a place for the spreading of nets. Thou shall be built no more, for I Jehovah have spoken it, says the lord Jehovah.
\[15]Thus says the lord Jehovah to Tyre: Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded groan, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?
\[16]Then all the rulers of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lie aside their robes, and strip off their broidered garments. They shall clothe themselves with trembling. They shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble every moment, and be astonished at thee.
\[17]And they shall take up a lamentation over thee, and say to thee, How thou are destroyed, who were inhabited by seafaring men, the renowned city that was strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, who caused their terror to be on all who dwelt there!
\[18]Now the isles shall tremble in the day of thy fall. Yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be dismayed at thy departure.
\[19]For thus says the lord Jehovah: When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited, when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and the great waters shall cover thee,
\[20]then I will bring thee down with those who descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and will make thee to dwell in the nether parts of the earth, in the places that are desolate of old, with those who go down to the pit, that thou not be inhabited. And I will set glory in the land of the living.
\[21]I will make thee a horror, and thou shall no more have any being. Though thou be sought for, yet thou shall never be found again, says the lord Jehovah.

\[4]Thy borders are in the heart of the seas. Thy builders have perfected thy beauty.
\[5]They have made all thy planks of fir trees from Senir. They have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for thee.
\[6]Of the oaks of Bashan they have made thine oars. They have made thy benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood, from the isles of Kittim.
\[7]Of fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thy sail, that it might be to thee for an ensign. Blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was thine awning.
\[8]The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were thy rowers. Thy wise men, O Tyre, were in thee; they were thy pilots.
\[9]The old men of Gebal and the wise men thereof were thy caulkers in thee. All the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to deal in thy merchandise.
\[10]Persia and Lud and Put were in thine army, thy men of war. They hung the shield and helmet in thee. They set forth thy comeliness.
\[11]The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about, and valorous men were in thy towers. They hung their shields upon thy walls round about. They have perfected thy beauty.
\[12]Tarshish was thy merchant because of the multitude of all kinds of riches, with silver, iron, tin, and lead. They traded for thy wares.
\[13]Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants. They traded the persons of men, and vessels of brass for thy merchandise.
\[14]Those of the house of Togarmah traded for thy wares with horses and war-horses and mules.
\[15]The men of Dedan were thy merchants. Many isles were the mart of thy hand. They brought thee in exchange horns of ivory and ebony.
\[16]Syria was thy merchant because of the multitude of thy handiworks. They traded for thy wares with emeralds, purple, and embroidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and rubies.
\[17]Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants. They traded for thy merchandise wheat of Minnith, and pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.
\[18]Damascus was thy merchant for the multitude of thy handiworks, because of the multitude of all kinds of riches, with the wine of Helbon, and white wool.

\[22]The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants. They traded for thy wares with the chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.
\[23]Haran and Canneh and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur and Chilmad, were thy merchants.
\[24]These were thy merchants in choice wares, in wrappings of blue and embroidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.
\[25]The ships of Tarshish were thy caravans for thy merchandise. And thou were replenished, and made very glorious in the heart of the seas.
\[26]Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters. The east wind has broken thee in the heart of the seas.
\[27]Thy riches, and thy wares, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy caulkers, and the dealers in thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, who are in thee, with all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy ruin.

\[31]And they shall make themselves bald for thee, and gird with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning.
\[32]And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, saying, Who is there like Tyre, like her that is brought to silence in the midst of the sea?
\[33]When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filled many peoples. Thou enriched the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.
\[34]In the time that thou were broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, thy merchandise and all thy company fell in the midst of thee.
\[35]All the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee, and their kings are horribly afraid; they are troubled in their countenance.

\[19]Thus I will execute judgments upon Egypt, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[20]And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[21]Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And, lo, it has not been bound up, to apply medicines, to put a bandage to bind it, that it be strong to hold the sword.
\[22]Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt. And I will break his arms, the strong arm, and that which was broken, and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.
\[23]And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
\[24]And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand. But I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a mortally wounded man.
\[25]And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down. And they shall know that I am Jehovah when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.
\[26]And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.

nd it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude, Whom are thou like in thy greatness?
\[3]Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a forest-like shade, and of high stature, and its top was among the thick boughs.
\[4]The waters nourished it. The deep made it to grow. The rivers of it ran round about its plantation, and it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field.
\[5]Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field, and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long because of many waters, when it shot them forth.
\[6]All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs, and under its branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young, and under its shadow dwelt all great nations.
\[7]Thus it was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches, for its root was by many waters.
\[8]The cedars in the garden of God could not dim it. The fir trees were not like its boughs, and the plane trees were not as its branches, nor was any tree in the garden of God like it in its beauty.
\[9]I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied it.
\[10]Therefore thus said the lord Jehovah: Because thou are exalted in stature, and he has set his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height,
\[11]I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations. He shall surely deal with him; I have driven him out for his wickedness.
\[12]And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him. Upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land. And all the peoples of the earth have gone down from his shadow, and have left him.
\[13]All the birds of the heavens shall dwell upon his ruin, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches,
\[14]to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, neither set their top among the thick boughs, nor that their mighty ones stand up on their height, even all that drink water. For they are all delivered to death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the sons of men, with those who go down to the pit.
\[15]Thus says the lord Jehovah: In the day when he went down to Sheol I caused a mourning. I covered the deep for him. And I restrained the rivers of it, and the great waters were stayed. And I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
\[16]I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall when I cast him down to Sheol with those who descend into the pit. And all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
\[17]They also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain by the sword, yea, those who were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the nations.
\[18]To whom are thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? Yet thou shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the nether parts of the earth. Thou shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the lord Jehovah.

\[2]Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, Thou were compared to a young lion of the nations. Yet thou are as a monster in the seas, and thou broke forth with thy rivers, and troubled the waters with thy feet, and fouled their rivers.
\[3]Thus says the lord Jehovah: I will spread out my net upon thee with a company of many peoples, and they shall bring thee up in my net.
\[4]And I will leave thee upon the land. I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the birds of the heavens to settle upon thee, and I will satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with thee.
\[5]And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.
\[6]I will also water the land, in which thou swim, with thy blood, even to the mountains. And the watercourses shall be full of thee.
\[7]And when I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heavens, and make the stars of it dark. I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light.
\[8]All the bright lights of heaven I will make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, says the lord Jehovah.
\[9]I will also vex the hearts of many peoples when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou have not known.
\[10]Yea, I will make many peoples amazed at thee. And their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee when I shall brandish my sword before them. And they shall tremble at every moment, each man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.
\[11]For thus says the lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.
\[12]By the swords of the mighty I will cause thy multitude to fall. They are all the terrible of the nations. And they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude of it shall be destroyed.
\[13]I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside many waters. Neither the foot of man shall trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.
\[14]Then I will make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, says the lord Jehovah.
\[15]When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of that of which it was full, when I shall smite all those who dwell therein, then they shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[16]This is the lamentation with which they shall lament. The daughters of the nations shall lament with that over Egypt, and over all her multitude. They shall lament with that, says the lord Jehovah.
\[17]It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[18]Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, to the nether parts of the earth, with those who go down into the pit.
\[19]Whom do thou pass in beauty? Go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.
\[20]They shall fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword. She is delivered to the sword. Draw her away and all her multitudes.
\[21]The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with those who help him. They have gone down. They lie still, even the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.
\[22]Asshur is there and all her company. Her graves are round about her, all of them slain, fallen by the sword,
\[23]whose graves are set in the outermost parts of the pit. And her company is round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.
\[24]There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who have gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit.
\[25]They have set a bed for her in the midst of the slain with all her multitude. Her graves are round about her, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword. For their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit. He is put in the midst of those who are slain.
\[26]There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude. Their graves are round about them, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, for they caused their terror in the land of the living.
\[27]And they shall not lie with the mighty who are fallen of the uncircumcised, who have gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads. But their iniquities are upon their bones, for they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
\[28]But thou shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shall lie with those who are slain by the sword.
\[29]There is Edom, its kings and all its rulers, who in their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword. They shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with those who go down to the pit.
\[30]There are the rulers of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain. In the terror which they caused by their might they are put to shame. And they lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.
\[31]Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, says the lord Jehovah.

\[2]Son of man, speak to the sons of thy people, and say to them, When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman,
\[3]if, when he sees the sword come upon the land, he blows the trumpet, and warns the people,
\[4]then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and takes no warning, if the sword comes, and takes him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.
\[5]He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took no warning; his blood shall be upon him. Whereas if he had taken warning, he would have delivered his soul.
\[6]But if the watchman sees the sword come, and does not blow the trumpet, and the people are not warned, and the sword comes, and takes any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at the watchman's hand.
\[7]So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
\[8]When I say to the wicked man, O wicked man, thou shall surely die, and thou do not speak to warn the wicked man from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at thy hand.
\[9]Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked man of his way to turn from it, and he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity, but thou have delivered thy soul.
\[10]And thou, son of man, say to the house of Israel, Thus ye speak, saying, Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we pine away in them. How then can we live?
\[11]Say to them, As I live, says the lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked man, but that the wicked man turn from his way and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
\[12]And thou, son of man, say to the sons of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous man shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression. And as for the wickedness of the wicked man, he shall not fall by it in the day that he turns from his wickedness, nor shall he who is righteous be able to live by it in the day that he sins.
\[13]When I say to the righteous man, that he shall surely live, if he trusts his righteousness, and commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered, but in his iniquity that he has committed, in it he shall die.
\[14]Again, when I say to the wicked man, Thou shall surely die, if he turns from his sin, and does that which is lawful and right,
\[15]if the wicked man restores the pledge, gives again that which he had taken by robbery, walks in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
\[16]None of his sins that he has committed shall be remembered against him. He has done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
\[17]Yet the sons of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equitable. But as for them, their way is not equitable.
\[18]When the righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, he shall even die in it.
\[19]And when the wicked man turns from his wickedness, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.
\[20]Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equitable. O house of Israel, I will judge you everyone according to his ways.
\[21]And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that a man who had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is smitten.
\[22]Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me in the evening, before he who escaped came. And he had opened my mouth until he came to me in the morning. And my mouth was opened, and I was no more mute.
\[23]And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\[24]Son of man, those who inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land, but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.
\[25]Therefore say to them, Thus says the lord Jehovah: Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood. And shall ye possess the land?
\[26]Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every man his neighbor's wife. And shall ye possess the land?
\[27]Thus shall thou say to them. Thus says the lord Jehovah: As I live, surely those who are in the waste places shall fall by the sword, and he who is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.
\[28]And I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment. And the pride of her power shall cease. And the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, so that none shall pass through.
\[29]Then they shall know that I am Jehovah when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all their abominations which they have committed.
\[30]And as for thee, son of man, the sons of thy people talk of thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, each one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that comes forth from Jehovah.
\[31]And they come to thee as the people come, and they sit before thee as my people. And they hear thy words, but do not do them. For with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their gain.
\[32]And, lo, thou are to them as a very lovely song of he who has a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument. For they hear thy words, but they do not do them.
\[33]And when this comes to pass, (behold, it comes), then they shall know that a prophet has been among them.

\[2]Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy, and say to them, even to the shepherds, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the sheep?
\[3]Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe yourselves with the wool. Ye kill the fatlings, but ye do not feed the sheep.
\[4]Ye have not strengthened the diseased, nor have ye healed that which was sick, nor have ye bound up that which was broken, nor have ye brought back that which was driven away, nor have ye sought that which was lost, but ye have ruled over them with force and with rigor.
\[5]And they were scattered because there was no shepherd. And they became food to all the beasts of the field, and were scattered.
\[6]My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill. Yea, my sheep were scattered upon all the face of the earth, and there was none who searched or sought.
\[7]Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:
\[8]As I live, says the lord Jehovah, surely inasmuch as my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to all the beasts of the field, because there was no shepherd, nor did my shepherds search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and did not feed my sheep,
\[9]therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah.
\[10]Thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep. Neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more, and I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, that they may not be food for them.
\[11]For thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.
\[12]As a shepherd seeks out his flock, in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad, so I will seek out my sheep, and I will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
\[13]And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land. And I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
\[14]I will feed them with good pasture, and their fold shall be upon the mountains of the height of Israel. There they shall lie down in a good fold, and on fat pasture they shall feed upon the mountains of Israel.
\[15]I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, says the lord Jehovah.
\[16]I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick, but I will destroy the fat and the strong. I will feed them in justice.
\[17]And as for you, O my flock, thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams and the he-goats.
\[18]Does it seem a small thing to you to have fed upon the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture, and to have drunk of the clear waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?
\[19]And as for my sheep, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.
\[20]Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah to them: Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
\[21]Because ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad,
\[22]therefore I will save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey. And I will judge between sheep and sheep.
\[23]And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David. He shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
\[24]And I, Jehovah, will be their God, and my servant David ruler among them. I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
\[25]And I will make a covenant of peace with them, and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
\[26]And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing, and I will cause the shower to come down in its season; there shall be showers of blessing.
\[27]And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land. And they shall know that I am Jehovah when I have broken the bars of their yoke, and have delivered them out of the hand of those who made bondmen of them.
\[28]And they shall no more be a prey to the nations, nor shall the beasts of the earth devour them, but they shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid.
\[29]And I will raise up to them a plantation for renown, and they shall no more be consumed with famine in the land, nor bear the shame of the nations any more.
\[30]And they shall know that I, Jehovah, their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, says the lord Jehovah.

\[10]And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it, and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be built.
\[11]And I will multiply upon you man and beast, and they shall increase and be fruitful. And I will cause you to be inhabited according to your former estate, and will do better to you than at your beginnings. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[12]Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel, and they shall possess thee, and thou shall be their inheritance, and thou shall no more henceforth bereave them of sons.

\[17]Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings. Their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.
\[18]Therefore I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood which they had poured out upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols.
\[19]And I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. I judged them according to their way and according to their doings.
\[20]And when they came to the nations where they went, they profaned my holy name, in that men said of them, These are the people of Jehovah, and have gone forth out of his land.
\[21]But I had regard for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they went.
\[22]Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the lord Jehovah: I do this not for your sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations where ye went.
\[23]And I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them. And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, says the lord Jehovah, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
\[24]For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.
\[25]And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean. I will cleanse you from all your filthiness, and from all your idols.
\[26]I will also give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. And I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.
\[27]And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my ordinances, and do them.
\[28]And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
\[29]And I will save you from all your uncleannesses. And I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine upon you.
\[30]And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye may no more receive the reproach of famine among the nations.
\[31]Then ye shall remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good. And ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.
\[32]I do this not for your sake, says the lord Jehovah; be it known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.
\[33]Thus says the lord Jehovah: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be built.
\[34]And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all who passed by.
\[35]And they shall say, This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden. And the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.
\[36]Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I, Jehovah, have built the ruined places, and planted that which was desolate. I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and I will do it.
\[37]Thus says the lord Jehovah: For this, moreover, I will be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them. I will increase them with men like a flock.
\[38]As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.

\[7]So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
\[8]And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above, but there was no breath in them.
\[9]Then he said to me, Prophesy to the wind. Prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus says the lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.
\[10]So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceedingly great army.
\[11]Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost. We are clean cut off.
\[12]Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people, and I will bring you into the land of Israel.
\[13]And ye shall know that I am Jehovah when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people.
\[14]And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live. And I will place you in your own land. And ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it and performed it, says Jehovah.
\[15]The word of Jehovah came again to me, saying,
\[16]And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the sons of Israel his companions. Then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions.
\[17]And join them one to another into one stick for thyself, that they may become one in thy hand.
\[18]And when the sons of thy people shall speak to thee, saying, Will thou not show us what thou mean by these?
\[19]say to them, Thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions, and I will put them with it, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.
\[20]And the sticks on which thou write shall be in thy hand before their eyes.
\[21]And say to them, Thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land.
\[22]And I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king to them all. And they shall no more be two nations, nor shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.
\[23]Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions, but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. So they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
\[24]And my servant David shall be king over them, and they all shall have one shepherd. They shall also walk in my ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.
\[25]And they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, in which your fathers dwelt. And they shall dwell therein, they, and their sons, and their son's sons, forever. And David my servant shall be their ruler forever.
\[26]Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them. It shall be an everlasting covenant with them, and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.
\[27]My tabernacle shall also be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
\[28]And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.

\[2]Son of man, set thy face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the ruler of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him.
\[3]And say, Thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, ruler of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal.
\[4]And I will turn thee about, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them handling swords,
\[5]Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet,
\[6]Gomer, and all his hordes, the house of Togarmah in the outermost parts of the north, and all his hordes, even many peoples with thee.
\[7]Be thou prepared. Yea, prepare thyself, thou, and all thy companies that are assembled to thee, and be thou a guard to them.
\[8]After many days thou shall be visited. In the latter years thou shall come into the land that is brought back from the sword, that is gathered out of many peoples, upon the mountains of Israel, which have been a continual waste, but it is brought forth out of the peoples, and they shall dwell securely, all of them.
\[9]And thou shall ascend. Thou shall come like a storm. Thou shall be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy hordes, and many peoples with thee.
\[10]Thus says the lord Jehovah: It shall come to pass in that day, that things shall come into thy mind, and thou shall devise an evil plan.
\[11]And thou shall say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages. I will go to those who are at rest, who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,
\[12]to take the spoil and to take the prey, to turn thy hand against the waste places that are now inhabited, and against the people who are gathered out of the nations, who have gotten cattle and goods, who dwell in the middle of the earth.
\[13]Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions of it, shall say to thee, Have thou come to take the spoil? Have thou assembled thy company to take the prey, to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take great spoil?
\[14]Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say to Gog, Thus says the lord Jehovah: In that day when my people Israel dwell securely, shall thou not know it?
\[15]And thou shall come from thy place out of the outermost parts of the north, thou, and many peoples with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company and a mighty army.
\[16]And thou shall come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land. It shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring thee against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.
\[17]Thus says the lord Jehovah: Are thou he of whom I spoke in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days for many years that I would bring thee against them?
\[18]And it shall come to pass in that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, says the lord Jehovah, that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils.
\[19]For I have spoken in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath. Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel,
\[20]so that the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men who are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence. And the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.
\[21]And I will call for a sword against him to all my mountains, says the lord Jehovah. Every man's sword shall be against his brother.
\[22]And I will enter into judgment with him with pestilence and with blood. And I will rain upon him, and upon his hordes, and upon the many peoples who are with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.
\[23]And I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.

\[3]And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.

\[5]Thou shall fall upon the open field, for I have spoken it, says the lord Jehovah.
\[6]And I will send a fire on Magog, and on those who dwell securely in the isles. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.
\[7]And I will make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel, nor will I allow my holy name to be profaned any more. And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, the Holy One in Israel.
\[8]Behold, it comes, and it shall be done, says the lord Jehovah. This is the day of which I have spoken.
\[9]And those who dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall make fires of the weapons and burn them, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the hand staves, and the spears. And they shall make fires of them seven years,
\[10]so that they shall take no wood out of the field, nor cut down any out of the forests, for they shall make fires of the weapons. And they shall plunder those who plundered them, and rob those who robbed them, says the lord Jehovah.
\[11]And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give to Gog a place for burial in Israel: the valley of those who pass through on the east of the sea. And it shall stop those who pass through, and they shall bury Gog and all his multitude there. And they shall call it The valley of Hamon-gog.
\[12]And the house of Israel shall be burying them seven months, that they may cleanse the land.
\[13]Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them, and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified, says the lord Jehovah.
\[14]And they shall set apart men of continual employment, who shall pass through the land. And, with those who pass through, those that bury those who remain upon the face of the land, to cleanse it, after the end of seven months they shall search.
\[15]And those who pass through the land shall pass through, and when any man sees a man's bone, then he shall set up a sign by it till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.
\[16]And Hamonah shall also be the name of a city. Thus they shall cleanse the land.
\[17]And thou, son of man, thus says the lord Jehovah: Speak to the birds of every sort, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come. Gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood.
\[18]Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the rulers of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
\[19]And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
\[20]And ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, says the lord Jehovah.
\[21]And I will set my glory among the nations. And all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.
\[22]So the house of Israel shall know that I am Jehovah their God, from that day and forward.
\[23]And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity, because they trespassed against me, and I hid my face from them. So I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they fell all of them by the sword.
\[24]I did to them according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions. And I hid my face from them.
\[25]Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Now I will bring back the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel. And I will be jealous for my holy name.
\[26]And they shall bear their shame, and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me, when they shall dwell securely in their land. And none shall make them afraid
\[27]when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations.
\[28]And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations, and have gathered them to their own land. And I will leave none of them any more there,
\[29]nor will I hide my face any more from them. For I have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, says the lord Jehovah.

n the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me there.
\[2]He brought me in the visions of God into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, upon which was as it were the frame of a city on the south.
\[3]And he brought me there, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed. And he stood in the gate.
\[4]And the man said to me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee. For thou are brought here to the intent that I may show them to thee. Declare all that thou see to the house of Israel.
\[5]And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each. So he measured the thickness of the building, one reed, and the height, one reed.
\[6]Then he came to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up the steps of it. And he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad, and the other threshold, one reed broad.
\[7]And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad, and the space between the little chambers was five cubits. And the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.
\[8]He also measured the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.
\[9]Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits, and the posts thereof, two cubits. And the porch of the gate was toward the house.
\[10]And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; those three were of one measure. And the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.
\[11]And he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits, and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits,
\[12]and a border before the little chambers, one cubit on this side, and a border, one cubit on that side, and the little chambers, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
\[13]And he measured the gate from the roof of the one little chamber to the roof of the other, a breadth of twenty-five cubits, door against door.
\[14]He also made posts, sixty cubits. And the court reached to the posts, round about the gate.
\[15]And from the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.
\[16]And there were closed windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches. And windows were round about inward, and upon each post were palm trees.
\[17]Then he brought me into the outer court. And, lo, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about; thirty chambers were upon the pavement.
\[18]And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable to the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.
\[19]Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside, a hundred cubits, both on the east and on the north.
\[20]And the gate of the outer court whose view is toward the north, he measured the length of it and the breadth of it.
\[21]And the little chambers of it were three on this side and three on that side. And the posts of it and the arches of it were according to the measure of the first gate: the length of it was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
\[22]And the windows of it, and the arches of it, and the palm trees of it, were according to the measure of the gate whose view is toward the east. And they went up to it by seven steps, and the arches of it were before them.
\[23]And there was a gate to the inner court opposite the other gate, both on the north and on the east, and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.
\[24]And he led me toward the south. And, behold, a gate toward the south. And he measured the posts of it and the arches of it according to these measures.
\[25]And there were windows in it, and in the arches of it round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
\[26]And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches of it were before them. And it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts of it.
\[27]And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south. And he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.
\[28]Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate. And he measured the south gate according to these measures,
\[29]and the little chambers of it, and the posts of it, and the arches of it, according to these measures. And there were windows in it and in the arches of it round about. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits broad.
\[30]And there were arches round about, twenty-five cubits long, and five cubits broad.
\[31]And the arches of it were toward the outer court, and palm trees were upon the posts of it. And the ascent to it had eight steps.
\[32]And he brought me into the inner court toward the east. And he measured the gate according to these measures,
\[33]and the little chambers of it, and the posts of it, and the arches of it, according to these measures. And there were windows in it and in the arches of it round about. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits broad.
\[34]And the arches of it were toward the outer court, and palm trees were upon the posts of it, on this side, and on that side. And the ascent to it had eight steps.
\[35]And he brought me to the north gate. And he measured it according to these measures,
\[36]the little chambers of it, the posts of it, and the arches of it. And there were windows in it round about. The length was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
\[37]And the posts of it were toward the outer court, and palm trees were upon the posts of it, on this side, and on that side. And the ascent to it had eight steps.
\[38]And a chamber with the door of it was by the posts at the gates. There they washed the burnt offering.
\[39]And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to kill on it the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.
\[40]And on the one side outside, at the going up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables, and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.
\[41]Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate, eight tables, upon which they killed the sacrifices.
\[42]And there were four tables for the burnt offering, of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high, upon which they laid the instruments of which they killed the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
\[43]And the hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened inside round about. And upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation.
\[44]And outside the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate, and their view was toward the south, one at the side of the east gate having the view toward the north.
\[45]And he said to me, This chamber, whose view is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.
\[46]And the chamber whose view is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Jehovah to minister to him.
\[47]And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare. And the altar was before the house.
\[48]Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side. And the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
\[49]The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, even by the steps by which they went up to it. And there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.

nd he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.
\[2]And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits. And the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side. And he measured the length of it, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.
\[3]Then he went inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits, and the entrance, six cubits, and the breadth of the entrance, seven cubits.
\[4]And he measured the length of it, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple. And he said to me, This is the most holy place.
\[5]Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits, and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.
\[6]And the side-chambers were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order. And they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side-chambers round about, that they might be attached to it, and not be attached to the wall of the house.
\[7]And the side-chambers were broader as they circled the house higher and higher, for the circling of the house went higher and higher round about the house. Therefore the breadth of the house continued upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the middle chamber.
\[8]I also saw that the house had a raised basement round about. The foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.
\[9]The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers, on the outside, was five cubits. And that which was left was the place of the side-chambers that belonged to the house.
\[10]And between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.
\[11]And the doors of the side-chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south. And the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.
\[12]And the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad, and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length of it ninety cubits.
\[13]So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long, and the separate place, and the building, with the walls of it, a hundred cubits long,
\[14]also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.
\[15]And he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at the back of it, and the galleries of it on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits, and the inner temple, and the porches of the court,
\[16]the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, opposite the threshold, paneled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),
\[17]to the space above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall round about inside and outside, by measure.
\[18]And it was made with cherubim and palm trees, and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub. And every cherub had two faces,
\[19]so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side, made through all the house round about.
\[20]Cherubim and palm trees were made from the ground to above the door. Thus was the wall of the temple.
\[21]As for the temple, the door-posts were squared. And as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance was as the appearance of the temple.
\[22]The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length of it two cubits, and the corners of it, and the length of it, and the walls of it, were of wood. And he said to me, This is the table that is before Jehovah.
\[23]And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
\[24]And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves, two for the one door, and two leaves for the other.
\[25]And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, just as were made upon the walls. And there was a threshold of wood upon the face of the porch outside.
\[26]And there were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch. Thus were the side-chambers of the house, and the thresholds.

hen he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north. And he brought me into the chamber that was opposite the separate place, and which was opposite the building toward the north.
\[2]In front was the north door, the length of a hundred cubits, and the breadth was fifty cubits.
\[3]Opposite the twenty which belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third story.
\[4]And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits' breadth inward, a way of one cubit, and their doors were toward the north.
\[5]Now the upper chambers were shorter, for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middlemost, in the building.
\[6]For they were in three stories, and they did not have pillars as the pillars of the courts. Therefore the uppermost was narrowed more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.
\[7]And the wall that was outside by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court before the chambers, the length of it was fifty cubits.
\[8]For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits. And, lo, of those on the front of the temple were a hundred cubits.
\[9]And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as going into them from the outer court.
\[10]In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were chambers.
\[11]And the way before them was like the appearance of the way of the chambers which were toward the north. According to their length so was their breadth. And all their exits were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
\[12]And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as entering into them.
\[13]Then he said to me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they are the holy chambers, where the priests that are near to Jehovah shall eat the most holy things. There they shall lay the most holy things, and the meal offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering, for the place is holy.
\[14]When the priests enter in, then they shall not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but they shall lay their garments there in which they minister, for they are holy. And they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which pertains to the people.
\[15]Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose view is toward the east, and measured it round about.
\[16]He measured on the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
\[17]He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.
\[18]He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
\[19]He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
\[20]He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall round about, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common.

\[3]And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city. And the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar. And I fell upon my face.

\[5]And the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.
\[6]And I heard speaking to me out of the house, and a man stood by me.
\[7]And he said to me, Son of man, this is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel forever. And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, and by the dead bodies of their kings in their high places,
\[8]in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their door-post beside my door-post, and there was but the wall between me and them. And they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed. Therefore I have consumed them in my anger.
\[9]Now let them put away their whoredom, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them forever.
\[10]Thou, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities, and let them measure the pattern.
\[11]And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, and the fashion of it, and the exits of it, and the entrances of it, and all the forms of it, and all the ordinances of it, and all the forms of it, and all the laws of it. And write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form of it, and all the ordinances of it, and do them.
\[12]This is the law of the house. Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit of it round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.
\[13]And these are the measures of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth). The bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border of it by the edge of it round about a span. And this shall be the base of the altar.
\[14]And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit. And from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit.
\[15]And the upper altar shall be four cubits. And from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns.
\[16]And the altar hearth shall be twelve long by twelve broad, square in the four sides of it.
\[17]And the ledge shall be fourteen long by fourteen broad in the four sides of it. And the border about it shall be half a cubit, and the bottom of it shall be a cubit round about. And the steps of it shall look toward the east.
\[18]And he said to me, Son of man, thus says the lord Jehovah: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings on it, and to sprinkle blood on it.
\[19]Thou shall give to the priests the Levites who are of the seed of Zadok, who are near to me, to minister to me, says the lord Jehovah, a young bullock for a sin offering.
\[20]And thou shall take of the blood of it, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the border round about. Thus thou shall cleanse it and make atonement for it.
\[21]Thou shall also take the bullock of the sin offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary.
\[22]And on the second day thou shall offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin offering. And they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the bullock.
\[23]When thou have made an end of cleansing it, thou shall offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
\[24]And thou shall bring them near before Jehovah, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to Jehovah.
\[25]Seven days thou shall prepare each day a goat for a sin offering. They shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.
\[26]Seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it. So they shall consecrate it.
\[27]And when they have accomplished the days, it shall be that upon the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings. And I will accept you, says the lord Jehovah.

hen he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looks toward the east. And it was shut.
\[2]And Jehovah said to me, This gate shall be shut. It shall not be opened, nor shall any man enter in by it, for Jehovah, the God of Israel, has entered in by it. Therefore it shall be shut.
\[3]As for the ruler, he shall sit in it as ruler to eat bread before Jehovah. He shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.
\[4]Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house. And I looked, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah. And I fell upon my face.
\[5]And Jehovah said to me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say to thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of Jehovah, and all the laws of it. And mark well the entrance of the house, with every exit of the sanctuary.
\[6]And thou shall say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus says the lord Jehovah: O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,
\[7]in that ye have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood. And they have broken my covenant, to add to all your abominations.
\[8]And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things, but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
\[9]Thus says the lord Jehovah: No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners that are among the sons of Israel.
\[10]But the Levites who went far from me, when Israel went astray, who went astray from me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity.
\[11]Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house. They shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.
\[12]Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have lifted up my hand against them, says the lord Jehovah, and they shall bear their iniquity.
\[13]And they shall not come near to me, to execute the office of priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, to the things that are most holy, but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.
\[14]Yet I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service of it, and for all that shall be done in it.
\[15]But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, who kept the charge of my sanctuary when the sons of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me. And they shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood, says the lord Jehovah:
\[16]they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my charge.
\[17]And it shall be that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments, and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.
\[18]They shall have linen headdresses upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins. They shall not gird themselves with anything that causes sweat.
\[19]And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they minister, and lay them in the holy chambers. And they shall put on other garments, that they not sanctify the people with their garments.
\[20]Neither shall they shave their heads, nor allow their locks to grow long. They shall only cut off the hair of their heads.
\[21]Neither shall any of the priests drink wine when they enter into the inner court.
\[22]Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her who is put away, but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest.
\[23]And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.
\[24]And in a controversy they shall stand to judge. They shall judge it according to my ordinances. And they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts, and they shall hallow my sabbaths.
\[25]And they shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves. But for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister who has had no husband, they may defile themselves.
\[26]And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon to him seven days.
\[27]And in the day that he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, says the lord Jehovah.
\[28]And they shall have an inheritance: I am their inheritance. And ye shall give them no possession in Israel. I am their possession.
\[29]They shall eat the meal offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering. And every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs.
\[30]And the first of all the first-fruits of every thing, and every oblation of everything, of all your oblations, shall be for the priest. Ye shall also give to the priests the first of your dough, to cause a blessing to rest on thy house.
\[31]The priests shall not eat of anything that dies of itself, or is torn, whether it be bird or beast.

oreover, when ye shall divide the land by lot for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation to Jehovah, a holy portion of the land. The length shall be the length of twenty-five thousand measures, and the breadth shall be ten thousand. It shall be holy in all the border of it round about.
\[2]Of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred by five hundred square round about, and fifty cubits for the suburbs of it round about.
\[3]And of this measure thou shall measure a length of twenty-five thousand, and a breadth of ten thousand. And the sanctuary shall be in it, which is most holy.
\[4]It is a holy portion of the land. It shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to Jehovah, and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary.
\[5]And twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth, shall be to the Levites, the ministers of the house, for a possession to themselves, for twenty chambers.
\[6]And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and twenty-five thousand long, side by side with the oblation of the holy portion. It shall be for the whole house of Israel.
\[7]And whatever is for the ruler shall be on the one side and on the other side of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy oblation and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east side eastward, and in length answerable to one of the portions, from the west border to the east border.
\[8]It shall be to him for a possession in the land in Israel. And my rulers shall no more oppress my people, but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
\[9]Thus says the lord Jehovah: Let it suffice you, O rulers of Israel. Remove violence and spoil, and execute justice and righteousness. Take away your exactions from my people, says the lord Jehovah.
\[10]Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.
\[11]The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer. The measure of it shall be according to the homer.
\[12]And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs. Twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.
\[13]This is the oblation that ye shall offer: The sixth part of an ephah from a homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of barley,
\[14]and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is ten baths, even a homer, (for ten baths are a homer),
\[15]and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel, for a meal offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them, says the lord Jehovah.
\[16]All the people of the land shall give to this oblation for the ruler in Israel.
\[17]And it shall be the ruler's part to give the burnt offerings, and the meal offerings, and the drink offerings, in the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the sabbaths, in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel. He shall prepare the sin offering, and the meal offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.
\[18]Thus says the lord Jehovah: In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shall take a young bullock without blemish, and thou shall cleanse the sanctuary.
\[19]And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it upon the door-posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.
\[20]And so thou shall do on the seventh day of the month for each one who errs, and for him who is simple. So shall ye make atonement for the house.
\[21]In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the Passover, a feast of seven days. Unleavened bread shall be eaten.
\[22]And upon that day the ruler shall prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.
\[23]And the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to Jehovah, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days, and a he-goat daily for a sin offering.
\[24]And he shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
\[25]In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, he shall do the like the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meal offering, and according to the oil.

hus says the lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days, but on the sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
\[2]And the ruler shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate outside, and shall stand by the post of the gate. And the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go forth, but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
\[3]And the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Jehovah on the sabbaths and on the new moons.
\[4]And the burnt offering that the ruler shall offer to Jehovah shall be on the sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish,
\[5]and the meal offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
\[6]And on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram. They shall be without blemish.
\[7]And he shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
\[8]And when the ruler shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go forth by the way of it.
\[9]But when the people of the land shall come before Jehovah in the appointed feasts, he who enters by the way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate, and he who enters by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate. He shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth straight before him.
\[10]And the ruler, when they go in, shall go in in the midst of them, and when they go forth, they shall go forth together.
\[11]And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meal offering shall be an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
\[12]And when the ruler shall prepare a freewill offering, a burnt offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to Jehovah, a man shall open for him the gate that looks toward the east. And he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he does on the sabbath day. Then he shall go forth, and after his going forth a man shall shut the gate.
\[13]And thou shall prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to Jehovah daily. Thou shall prepare it morning by morning.
\[14]And thou shall prepare a meal offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour, a meal offering to Jehovah continually by a perpetual ordinance.
\[15]Thus they shall prepare the lamb, and the meal offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt offering.
\[16]Thus says the lord Jehovah: If the ruler gives a gift to any of his sons, it is his inheritance. It shall belong to his sons. It is their possession by inheritance.
\[17]But if he gives a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty, then it shall return to the ruler. But as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons.
\[18]Moreover the ruler shall not take of the people's inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession. He shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people be not scattered each man from his possession.
\[19]Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north. And, behold, there was a place on the rear part westward.
\[20]And he said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the meal offering, that they not bring them forth into the outer court, to sanctify the people.
\[21]Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court. And, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.
\[22]In the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed, forty long and thirty broad. These four in the corners were of one measure.
\[23]And there was a wall round about in them, round about the four. And boiling-places were made under the walls round about.
\[24]Then said he to me, These are the boiling-houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.

nd he brought me back to the door of the house. And, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward, for the forefront of the house was toward the east. And the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar.
\[2]Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way outside to the outer gate, by the way of the gate that looks toward the east. And, behold, waters ran out on the right side.
\[3]When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.
\[4]Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the loins.
\[5]Afterward he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.
\[6]And he said to me, Son of man, have thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.
\[7]Now when I had returned, behold, upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
\[8]Then he said to me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah. And they shall go toward the sea, into the sea which were made to issue forth, and the waters shall be healed.
\[9]And it shall come to pass, that every living creature which swarms, in every place where the rivers come, shall live. And there shall be a very great multitude of fish (for these waters have come there) and shall be healed. And everything shall live wherever the river comes.
\[10]And it shall come to pass, that fishermen shall stand by it. From En-gedi even to En-eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets. Their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, very many.
\[11]But the miry places of it, and the marshes of it, shall not be healed. They shall be given up to salt.
\[12]And by the river upon the bank of it, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not wither, nor shall the fruit of it fail. It shall bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters of it issue out of the sanctuary. And the fruit of it shall be for food, and the leaf of it for healing.
\[13]Thus says the lord Jehovah: This shall be the border by which ye shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions.
\[14]And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another, for I swore to give it to your fathers. And this land shall fall to you for inheritance.
\[15]And this shall be the border of the land: On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad,
\[16]Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath, Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran.
\[17]And the border from the sea, shall be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus, and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.
\[18]And the east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan, from the north border to the east sea ye shall measure. This is the east side.
\[19]And the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the brook of Egypt, to the great sea. This is the south side southward.
\[20]And the west side shall be the great sea, from the south border as far as opposite the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side.
\[21]So ye shall divide this land to you according to the tribes of Israel.
\[22]And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you and to the strangers who sojourn among you, who shall beget sons among you. And they shall be to you as the home-born among the sons of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
\[23]And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourns, there ye shall give him his inheritance, says the lord Jehovah.

n the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and besieged it.
\[2]And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God. And he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god, and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.
\[3]And the king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in certain of the sons of Israel, even of the seed royal and of the ranking men,
\[4]youths in whom was no blemish, but well-favored, and skilful in all wisdom, and endued with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability to stand in the king's palace. And that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
\[5]And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king's food, and of the wine which he drank. And that they should be nourished three years, that at the end of it they should stand before the king.
\[6]Now among these were, of the sons of Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
\[7]And the ruler of the eunuchs gave names to them. To Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar, and to Hananiah, of Shadrach, and to Mishael, of Meshach, and to Azariah, of Abednego.
\[8]But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's food, nor with the wine which he drank. Therefore he requested of the ruler of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
\[9]Now God made Daniel find kindness and compassion in the sight of the ruler of the eunuchs.
\[10]And the ruler of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink. For why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths that are of your own age? So ye would endanger my head with the king.
\[11]Then Daniel said to the steward whom the ruler of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
\[12]Test thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days, and let them give us vegetables to eat, and water to drink.
\[13]Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king's food. And as thou see, deal with thy servants.
\[14]So he hearkened to them in this matter, and tested them ten days.
\[15]And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared finer, and they were fuller in flesh, than all the youths who ate of the king's dainties.
\[16]So the steward took away their food, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them vegetables.
\[17]Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom. And Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
\[18]And at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the ruler of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
\[19]And the king conversed with them. And among them all none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore they stood before the king.
\[20]And in every matter of wisdom and understanding, concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters who were in all his realm.
\[21]And Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus.

nd in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams. And his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him.
\[2]Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king.
\[3]And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.
\[4]Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in the Syrian language, O king, live forever. Tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.
\[5]The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me. If ye do not make the dream and the interpretation of it known to me, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.
\[6]But if ye show the dream and the interpretation of it, ye shall receive gifts and rewards and great honor from me. Therefore show the dream and the interpretation of it to me.
\[7]They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.
\[8]The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that ye would gain time, because ye see the thing has gone from me.
\[9]But if ye do not make known to me the dream, there is but one law for you, for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me till the time is changed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation of it.
\[10]The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth who can show the king's matter. Inasmuch as no king, lord, or ruler, has asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean.
\[11]And it is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is no other who can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.
\[12]For this reason the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
\[13]So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain. And they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.
\[14]Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch, the captain of the king's guard, who went forth to kill the wise men of Babylon.
\[15]He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so urgent from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
\[16]And Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.
\[17]Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,
\[18]that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret, that Daniel and his companions should nor perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
\[19]Then the secret was shown to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
\[20]Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, for wisdom and might are his.
\[21]And he changes the times and the seasons. He removes kings, and sets up kings. He gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to those who have understanding.
\[22]He reveals the deep and secret things. He knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him.
\[23]I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who has given me wisdom and might, and has now made known to me what we desired of thee, for thou have made known to us the king's matter.
\[24]Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said thus to him: Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon. Bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.
\[25]Then Arioch brought Daniel in before the king in haste, and said thus to him: I have found a man of the sons of the captivity of Judah, who will make known the interpretation to the king.
\[26]The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are thou able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation of it?
\[27]Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king has demanded, neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, can show to the king,
\[28]but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets. And he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:
\[29]As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter. And he who reveals secrets has made known to thee what shall come to pass.
\[30]But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living man, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou may know the thoughts of thy heart.
\[31]Thou, O king, saw, and, behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee, and the appearance of it was fearful.
\[32]As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,
\[33]its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay.
\[34]Thou looked until a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.
\[35]Then the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, was broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors. And the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them. And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
\[36]This is the dream, and we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.
\[37]Thou, O king, are a king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory.
\[38]And wherever the sons of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens, he has given into thy hand, and has made thee to rule over them all. Thou are the head of gold.
\[39]And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.
\[40]And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things. And as iron that crushes all these, it shall break in pieces and crush.
\[41]And whereas thou saw the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom. But there shall be of the strength of the iron in it, inasmuch as thou saw the iron mixed with miry clay.
\[42]And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.
\[43]And whereas thou saw the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men, but they shall not cling one to another, even as iron does not mix with clay.
\[44]And in the days of those kings the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty of it be left to another people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.
\[45]Inasmuch as thou saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter. And the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.
\[46]Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors to him.
\[47]The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since thou have been able to reveal this secret.
\[48]Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.
\[49]And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon, but Daniel was in the gate of the king.

ebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits, and the breadth of it six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
\[2]Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
\[3]Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up, and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
\[4]Then the herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,
\[5]that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.
\[6]And he who does not fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
\[7]Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
\[8]Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews.
\[9]They answered and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live forever.
\[10]Thou, O king, have made a decree, that every man who shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image.
\[11]And he who does not fall down and worship, shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
\[12]There are certain Jews whom thou have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, have not regarded thee. They do not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou have set up.
\[13]Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.
\[14]Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, Is it of purpose, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that ye do not serve my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?
\[15]Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made, well. But if ye do not worship, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. And who is that god who shall deliver you out of my hands?
\[16]Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.
\[17]If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king.
\[18]But if not, be it known to thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou have set up.
\[19]Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was accustomed to be heated.
\[20]And he commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
\[21]Then these men were bound in their coats, their tunics, and their head coverings, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
\[22]Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace very hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
\[23]And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
\[24]Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste. He spoke and said to his counselors, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king.
\[25]He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no harm. And the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.
\[26]Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace. He spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came forth out of the midst of the fire.
\[27]And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king's counselors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed. Neither were their coats changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.
\[28]Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his agent, and delivered his servants who trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
\[29]Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speaks anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill, because there is no other god who is able to deliver after this sort.
\[30]Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.

ebuchadnezzar the king, to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.
\[2]It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has wrought toward me.
\[3]How great are his signs, and how mighty are his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.
\[4]I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.
\[5]I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
\[6]Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
\[7]Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers came in, and I told the dream before them, but they did not make the interpretation of it known to me.
\[8]But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. And I told the dream before him, saying,
\[9]O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubles thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.
\[10]Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and, behold, a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height of it was great.
\[11]The tree grew, and was strong, and the height of it reached to heaven, and the sight of it to the end of all the earth.
\[12]The leaves of it were fine, and the fruit of it much, and food was in it for all. The beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in the branches of it. And all flesh was fed from it.
\[13]I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.
\[14]He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches. Shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches.
\[15]Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field. And let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.
\[16]Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given to him. And let seven times pass over him.
\[17]The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones, to the intent that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will, and sets up over it the lowest of men.
\[18]This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. And thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, inasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation. But thou are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.
\[19]Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken mute for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, may the dream be to those who hate thee, and the interpretation of it to thine adversaries.
\[20]The tree that thou saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to heaven, and the sight of it to all the earth,
\[21]whose leaves were fine, and the fruit of it much, and in it was food for all, under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the birds of the heavens had their habitation,
\[22]it is thou, O king, who have grown and become strong. For thy greatness has grown, and reaches to heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.
\[23]And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew down the tree, and destroy it. Nevertheless leave the stump of the roots of it in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field. And let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;
\[24]this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king:
\[25]That thou shall be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. And thou shall be made to eat grass as oxen, and shall be wet with the dew of heaven. And seven times shall pass over thee till thou know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.
\[26]And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, thy kingdom shall be sure to thee, after thou shall have known that the heavens do rule.
\[27]Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor, if there may be a lengthening of thy tranquility.
\[28]All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
\[29]At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.
\[30]The king spoke and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling-place by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?
\[31]While the word was in the king's mouth, a voice from heaven fell, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from thee.
\[32]And thou shall be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. Thou shall be made to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.
\[33]The same hour the thing was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar. And he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen. And his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.
\[34]And at the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me. And I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him who lives forever. For his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation.
\[35]And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing, and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth. And none can stay his hand, or say to him, What are thou doing?
\[36]At the same time my understanding returned to me, and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned to me, and my counselors and my lords sought to me. And I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me.
\[37]Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, for all his works are truth, and his ways justice. And he is able to abase those who walk in pride.

elshazzar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.
\[2]Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem, that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink from there.
\[3]Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem. And the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank from them.
\[4]They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
\[5]In the same hour the fingers of a man's hand came forth, and wrote opposite the lampstand upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace. And the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
\[6]Then the king's countenance was changed in him, and his thoughts troubled him. And the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.
\[7]The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation of it, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\[8]Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation.
\[9]Then king Belshazzar was greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.
\[10]Now the queen came into the banquet house because of the words of the king and his lords. The queen spoke and said, O king, live forever. Let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed.
\[11]There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. And in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him. And the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers,
\[12]inasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.
\[13]Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king spoke and said to Daniel, Are thou that Daniel, who are of the sons of the captivity of Judah, whom my father the king brought out of Judah?
\[14]I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in thee.
\[15]And now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known to me the interpretation of it, but they could not show the interpretation of the thing.
\[16]But I have heard of thee, that thou can give interpretations, and dissolve doubts. Now if thou can read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation of it, thou shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\[17]Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another. Nevertheless I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
\[18]O thou king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom and greatness and glory and majesty.
\[19]And because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. Whom he wanted, he killed, and whom he wanted, he kept alive, and whom he wanted, he raised up, and whom he wanted, he put down.
\[20]But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne. And they took his glory from him,
\[21]and he was driven from the sons of men. And his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men, and that he sets up over it whomever he will.
\[22]And thou his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled thy heart, though thou knew all this,
\[23]but have lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven. And they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine from them. And thou have praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor know. And the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, thou have not glorified.
\[24]Then the part of the hand was sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.
\[25]And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
\[26]This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE, God has numbered thy kingdom, and brought it to an end.
\[27]TEKEL, thou are weighed in the balances, and are found wanting.
\[28]PERES, thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
\[29]Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\[30]In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain.
\[31]And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.

t pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom,
\[2]and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one, that these satraps might give account to them, and that the king should have no damage.
\[3]Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him, and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
\[4]Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom, but they could find no occasion nor fault, inasmuch as he was faithful, nor was there any error or fault found in him.
\[5]Then these men said, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel unless we find it against him concerning the law of his God.
\[6]Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus to him: King Darius, live forever.
\[7]All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counselors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong interdict, that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
\[8]Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not alter.
\[9]Therefore king Darius signed the writing and the interdict.
\[10]And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his chamber toward Jerusalem) and he knelt upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did formerly.
\[11]Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.
\[12]Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king's interdict. Have thou not signed an interdict, that every man who shall make petition to any god or man within thirty days, except to thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not alter.
\[13]Then they answered and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the sons of the captivity of Judah, does not regard thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.
\[14]Then the king, when he heard these words, was very displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him. And he labored till the going down of the sun to rescue him.
\[15]Then these men assembled together to the king, and said to the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establishes may be changed.
\[16]Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said to Daniel, Thy God whom thou serve continually, he will deliver thee.
\[17]And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den. And the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.
\[18]Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting, nor were instruments of music brought before him. And his sleep fled from him.
\[19]Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions.
\[20]And when he came near to the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice. The king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou serve continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?
\[21]Then Daniel said to the king, O king, live forever.
\[22]My God has sent his agent, and has shut the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me, inasmuch as before him innocence was found in me. And also before thee, O king, I have done no harm.
\[23]Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of harm was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God.
\[24]And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their sons, and their wives. And the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.
\[25]Then king Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.
\[26]I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, for he is the living God, and steadfast forever. And his kingdom is that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even to the end.
\[27]He delivers and rescues, and he works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
\[28]So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

n the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed. Then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.
\[2]Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven broke forth upon the great sea.
\[3]And four great beasts came up from the sea, different one from another.
\[4]The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings. I beheld till the wings of it were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.
\[5]And, behold, another beast, a second, like a bear, and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. And they said thus to it: Arise, devour much flesh.
\[6]After this I beheld, and, lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird. The beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it.
\[7]After this I saw in the night visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, fearful and powerful, and exceedingly strong. And it had great iron teeth. It devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet. And it was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns.
\[8]I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.
\[9]I beheld till thrones were placed, and one who was ancient of days sat. His raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool. His throne was fiery flames, and the wheels of it burning fire.
\[10]A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him. Thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The judgment was set, and the books were opened.
\[11]I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke. I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.
\[12]And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away. Yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
\[13]I saw in the night visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven someone like a son of man. And he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
\[14]And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.
\[15]As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.
\[16]I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.
\[17]These great beasts, which are four, are four kings who shall arise out of the earth.
\[18]But the sanctified of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.
\[19]Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all of them, exceedingly fearful, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass, which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet,
\[20]and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose look was greater than its fellows.
\[21]I beheld, and the same horn made war with the sanctified, and prevailed against them
\[22]until the ancient of days came. And judgment was given to the sanctified of the Most High, and the time came that the sanctified possessed the kingdom.
\[23]Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
\[24]And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise. And another shall arise after them, and he shall be different from the former. And he shall put down three kings.
\[25]And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the sanctified of the Most High. And he shall think to change the times and the law, and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.
\[26]But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end.
\[27]And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the sanctified of the Most High. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
\[28]Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me much, and my countenance was changed in me, but I kept the matter in my heart.

n the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, even to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.
\[2]And I saw in the vision, now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam, and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.
\[3]Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns. And the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
\[4]I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward, and no beasts could stand before him, nor was there any that could deliver out of his hand, but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.
\[5]And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and did not touch the ground. And the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.
\[6]And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.
\[7]And I saw him come close to the ram. And he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns. And there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him. And there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
\[8]And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly. And when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of heaven.
\[9]And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceedingly great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land.
\[10]And it grew great, even to the host of heaven. And it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and trampled upon them.
\[11]Yea, it magnified itself, even to the Prince of the host. And it took away from him the continual burnt offering, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
\[12]And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt offering through transgression. And it cast down truth to the ground, and it did its pleasure and prospered.
\[13]Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to that certain one who spoke, How long shall be the vision of the continual burnt offering, and the transgression that make desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
\[14]And he said to me, To two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary shall be cleansed.
\[15]And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it, and, behold, there stood before me someone as the appearance of a man.
\[16]And I heard a man's voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.
\[17]So he came near where I stood. And when he came, I was frightened, and fell upon my face. But he said to me, Understand, O son of man, for the vision belongs to the time of the end.
\[18]Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground, but he touched me, and set me upright.
\[19]And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation, for it belongs to the appointed time of the end.
\[20]The ram which thou saw, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.
\[21]And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece. And the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.
\[22]And as for that which was broken, in the place of which four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.
\[23]And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding hidden things, shall stand up.
\[24]And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power, and he shall destroy amazingly, and shall prosper and do his pleasure. And he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.
\[25]And through his policy he shall cause deceit to prosper in his hand, and he shall magnify himself in his heart. And he shall destroy many in their security. He shall also stand up against the Prince of princes, but he shall be broken without a hand.
\[26]And the vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true. But shut thou up the vision, for it belongs to many days to come.
\[27]And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days. Then I rose up, and did the king's business. And I wondered at the vision, but none understood it.

n the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,
\[2]in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years of which the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishing of the desolations of Jerusalem, even seventy years.
\[3]And I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.
\[4]And I prayed to Jehovah my God, and made confession, and said, Oh, Lord, the great and fearful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments,
\[5]we have sinned, and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from thy precepts and from thine ordinances,
\[6]nor have we hearkened to thy servants the prophets, who spoke in thy name to our kings, our rulers, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
\[7]O Lord, righteousness belongs to thee, but to us confusion of face, as at this day, to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, who are near, and who are far off, through all the countries where thou have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.
\[8]O Lord, to us belongs confusion of face, to our kings, to our rulers, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
\[9]To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him,
\[10]nor have we obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
\[11]Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even turning aside, that they should not obey thy voice. Therefore the curse has been poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God. For we have sinned against him.
\[12]And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil, for under the whole heaven has not been done as has been done upon Jerusalem.
\[13]As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil has come upon us. Yet we have not entreated the favor of Jehovah our God, that we should turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in thy truth.
\[14]Therefore Jehovah has watched over the evil, and brought it upon us, for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works which he does, and we have not obeyed his voice.
\[15]And now, O Lord our God, who has brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and has gotten thee renown, as at this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
\[16]O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, let thine anger and thy wrath, I pray thee, be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain. Because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people have become a reproach to all who are round about us.
\[17]Now therefore, O our God, hearken to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.
\[18]O my God, incline thine ear, and hear. Open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name. For we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousness, but for thy great mercies' sake.
\[19]O Lord, hear. O Lord, forgive. O Lord, hearken and do. Defer not, for thine own sake, O my God, because thy city and thy people are called by thy name.
\[20]And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God,
\[21]yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.
\[22]And he instructed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I have now come forth to give thee wisdom and understanding.
\[23]At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment went forth, and I have come to tell thee, for thou are greatly beloved. Therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision.
\[24]Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy.
\[25]Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the anointed one, the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks. It shall be built again, with street and moat, even in troublesome times.
\[26]And after the sixty-two weeks the anointed one shall be cut off, and shall have nothing. And the people of the prince who shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary, and the end of it shall be with a flood. And even to the end shall be war; desolations are determined.
\[27]And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week. And in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease. And upon the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate. And even to the full end, and that determined, wrath shall be poured out upon the desolate.

n the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar, and the thing was true, even a great warfare. And he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.
\[2]In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.
\[3]I ate no pleasant bread. Neither flesh nor wine came into my mouth. Neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.
\[4]And in the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel,
\[5]I lifted up my eyes, and looked. And, behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz.
\[6]Also his body was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.
\[7]And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great quaking fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.
\[8]So I was left alone, and saw this great vision. And there remained no strength in me, for my fitness was turned in me into debility, and I retained no strength.
\[9]Yet I heard the voice of his words. And when I heard the voice of his words, then I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.
\[10]And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.
\[11]And he said to me, O Daniel, thou man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to thee, and stand upright, for I am now sent to thee. And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood, trembling.
\[12]Then he said to me, Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that thou set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard. And I have come for thy words' sake.
\[13]But the ruler of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days, but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me. And I remained there with the kings of Persia.
\[14]I have come now to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days, for the vision is yet for many days.
\[15]And when he had spoken to me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was mute.
\[16]And, behold, someone in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth, and spoke and said to him who stood before me, O my lord, because of the vision my pains have turned upon me, and I retain no strength.
\[17]For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? For as for me, straightaway there remained no strength in me, nor was there breath left in me.
\[18]Then someone like the appearance of a man touched me again, and he strengthened me.
\[19]And he said, O man greatly beloved, fear not. Peace be to thee. Be strong, yea, be strong. And when he spoke to me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak, for thou have strengthened me.
\[20]Then he said, Do thou know why I have come to thee? And now I will return to fight with the ruler of Persia. And when I go forth, lo, the ruler of Greece shall come.
\[21]But I will tell thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth. And there is none who holds with me against these, but Michael your prince.

nd as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.
\[2]And now I will show thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia, and the fourth shall be far richer than them all. And when he has grown strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece.
\[3]And a mighty king shall stand up, who shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.
\[4]And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion with which he ruled, for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides these.
\[5]And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his rulers. And he shall be powerful over him, and have dominion. His dominion shall be a great dominion.
\[6]And at the end of years they shall join themselves together. And the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement, but she shall not retain the strength of her arm, nor shall he stand, nor his arm. But she shall be given up, and also those who brought her, and he who begot her, and he who strengthened her in those times.
\[7]But out of a shoot from her roots shall a man stand up in his place, who shall come to the army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail.
\[8]And also their gods, with their molten images, and with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold, he shall carry captive into Egypt, and he shall refrain from the king of the north some years.
\[9]And he shall come into the realm of the king of the south, but he shall return into his own land.
\[10]And his sons shall war, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall come on, and overflow, and pass through. And they shall return and war, even to his fortress.
\[11]And the king of the south shall be moved with anger, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north. And he shall set forth a great multitude, and the multitude shall be given into his hand.
\[12]And the multitude shall be lifted up, and his heart shall be exalted. And he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail.
\[13]And the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and he shall come on at the end of the times, even of years, with a great army and with much substance.
\[14]And in those times many shall stand up against the king of the south. Also the sons of the violent among thy people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision, but they shall fall.
\[15]So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city. And the forces of the south shall not stand, nor his chosen people. Neither shall there be any strength to stand.
\[16]But he who comes against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him. And he shall stand in the glorious land, and in his hand shall be destruction.
\[17]And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him equitable conditions, and he shall perform them. And he shall give him the daughter of women, to corrupt her, but she shall not stand, nor be for him.
\[18]After this he shall turn his face to the isles, and shall take many. But a ruler shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease. Yea, moreover, he shall cause his reproach to turn upon him.
\[19]Then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land, but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found.
\[20]Then someone shall stand up in his place who shall cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom, but within a few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.
\[21]And in his place he who is contemptible shall stand up, to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom. But he shall come in time of security, and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
\[22]And the overwhelming forces shall be overwhelmed from before him, and shall be broken, yea, also the ruler of the covenant.
\[23]And after the league made with him, he shall work deceitfully, for he shall come up, and shall become strong, with a small people.
\[24]He shall come in time of security even upon the fattest places of the province, and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers. He shall scatter among them prey, and spoil, and substance. Yea, he shall devise his devices against the strongholds, even for a time.
\[25]And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army. And the king of the south shall war in battle with a very great and mighty army, but he shall not stand, for they shall devise devices against him.
\[26]Yea, those who eat of his food shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow, and many shall fall down slain.
\[27]And as for both these kings, their hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table. But it shall not prosper, for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.
\[28]Then he shall return into his land with great substance. And his heart shall be against the holy covenant, and he shall do his pleasure, and return to his own land.
\[29]At the time appointed he shall return, and come into the south, but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former.
\[30]For ships of Kittim shall come against him. Therefore he shall be grieved, and shall return, and have indignation against the holy covenant, and shall do his pleasure. He shall even return, and have regard to those who forsake the holy covenant.
\[31]And forces shall stand on his part, and they shall profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and shall take away the continual burnt offering, and they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate.
\[32]And he shall pervert by flatteries such as do wickedly against the covenant. But the people who know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.
\[33]And those who are wise among the people shall instruct many, yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil, many days.
\[34]Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help, but many shall join themselves to them with flatteries.
\[35]And some of those who are wise shall fall, to refine them, and to purify, and to make them white, even to the time of the end, because it is yet for the time appointed.
\[36]And the king shall do according to his will. And he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods. And he shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished, for that which is determined shall be done.
\[37]Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god, for he shall magnify himself above all.
\[38]But in his place he shall honor the god of fortresses. And a god whom his fathers did not know, he shall honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.
\[39]And he shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god. Whoever acknowledges him he will increase with glory, and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for a price.
\[40]And at the time of the end, the king of the south shall contend with him, and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships, and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass through.
\[41]He shall also enter into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown. But these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the sons of Ammon.
\[42]He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
\[43]But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt. And the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.
\[44]But news out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him, and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and to utterly sweep away many.
\[45]And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain, yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.

he word of Jehovah that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
\[2]When Jehovah spoke at the first by Hosea, Jehovah said to Hosea, Go, take to thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom, for the land commits great whoredom, departing from Jehovah.

\[4]And Jehovah said to him, Call his name Jezreel, for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.
\[5]And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
\[6]And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And Jehovah said to him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah, for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel, that I should in any way pardon them.
\[7]But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by Jehovah their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.
\[8]Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son.
\[9]And Jehovah said, Call his name Lo-ammi, for ye are not my people, and I will not be yours.
\[10]Yet the number of the sons of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered. And it shall come to pass that, in the place where it was said to them, Ye are not my people, it shall be said to them, The sons of the living God.
\[11]And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up from the land, for great shall be the day of Jezreel.

\[3]lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and kill her with thirst.
\[4]Yea, I will have no mercy upon her sons, for they are sons of whoredom,
\[5]for their mother has played the harlot. She who conceived them has done shamefully, for she said, I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.
\[6]Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, that she shall not find her paths.
\[7]And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them. And she shall seek them, but shall not find them. Then she shall say, I will go and return to my first husband, for it was better with me then than now.
\[8]For she did not know that I gave her the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.
\[9]Therefore I will take back my grain in the time of it, and my new wine in the season of it, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.
\[10]And now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.
\[11]I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.
\[12]And I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, of which she has said, These are my hire that my lovers have given me. And I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
\[13]And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim, to which she burned incense when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, says Jehovah.
\[14]Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak soothingly to her.
\[15]And I will give her her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope. And she shall make answer there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
\[16]And it shall be at that day, says Jehovah, that thou shall call me Ishi, and shall no more call me Baali.
\[17]For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name.
\[18]And in that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and with the creeping things of the ground. And I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie down safely.
\[19]And I will betroth thee to me forever. Yea, I will betroth thee to me in righteousness, and in justice, and in loving kindness, and in mercies.
\[20]I will even betroth thee to me in faithfulness, and thou shall know Jehovah.
\[21]And it shall come to pass in that day, I will answer, says Jehovah. I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth,
\[22]and the earth shall answer the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, and they shall answer Jezreel.
\[23]And I will sow her to me in the earth. And I will have mercy upon her who had not obtained mercy. And I will say to those who were not my people, Thou are my people, and they shall say, My God.

\[2]There is nothing but swearing and breaking faith, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery. They break out, and blood touches blood.
\[3]Therefore the land shall mourn, and everyone who dwells in it shall languish with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens. Yea, the fishes of the sea shall also be taken away.
\[4]Yet, let no man strive, nor let any man reprove, for thy people are as those who strive with the priest.
\[5]And thou shall stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night. And I will destroy thy mother.
\[6]My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because thou have rejected knowledge, I also will reject thee, that thou shall be no priest to me. Since thou have forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy sons.
\[7]As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me. I will change their glory into shame.
\[8]They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity.
\[9]And it shall be, like people, like priest. And I will punish them for their ways, and will requite them their doings.
\[10]And they shall eat, and not have enough. They shall play the harlot, and shall not increase, because they have left off taking heed to Jehovah.
\[11]Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding.
\[12]My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declares to them, for the spirit of whoredom has caused them to err, and they have played the harlot, departing from under their God.
\[13]They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow of it is good. Therefore your daughters play the harlot, and your brides commit adultery.
\[14]I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot, nor your brides when they commit adultery. For themselves go apart with harlots, and they sacrifice with the prostitutes. And the people who do not understand shall be overthrown.
\[15]Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend, and come not ye to Gilgal, nor go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As Jehovah lives.
\[16]For Israel has behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer. Now Jehovah will feed them as a lamb in a large place.
\[17]Ephraim is joined to idols, let him alone.
\[18]Their drink has become sour. They play the harlot continually. Her rulers dearly love shame.

\[13]Gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament, ye priests. Wail, ye ministers of the altar. Come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God. For the meal offering and the drink offering are withheld from the house of your God.
\[14]Sanctify a fast. Call a solemn assembly. Gather the old men and all the inhabitants of the land to the house of Jehovah your God, and cry to Jehovah.
\[15]Alas for the day! For the day of Jehovah is at hand, and it shall come as destruction from the Almighty.
\[16]Is not the food cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God?
\[17]The seeds rot under their clods. The garners are laid desolate. The barns are broken down. For the grain is withered.
\[18]How do the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are perplexed because they have no pasture, yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
\[19]O Jehovah, to thee do I cry. For the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame has burned all the trees of the field.
\[20]Yea, the beasts of the field pant to thee, for the water brooks are dried up, and the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.

low ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain. Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble. For the day of Jehovah comes, for it is near at hand,
\[2]a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spreads upon the mountains, a great people and a strong, there has not ever been the like, nor shall be any more after them, even to the years of many generations.
\[3]A fire devours before them, and behind them a flame burns. The land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness. Yea, and none has escaped them.
\[4]The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses, and as horsemen, so do they run.
\[5]They leap like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains, like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.
\[6]At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces have grown pale.
\[7]They run like mighty men. They climb the wall like men of war, and they march each one on his ways. And they do not break their ranks.
\[8]Neither does one push another. They march each one in his path, and they burst through the weapons, and do not break off.
\[9]They leap upon the city. They run upon the wall. They climb up into the houses. They enter in at the windows like a thief.
\[10]The earth quakes before them. The heavens tremble. The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.
\[11]And Jehovah utters his voice before his army, for his camp is very great. For he is strong who executes his word. For the day of Jehovah is great and very fearful, and who can abide it?
\[12]Yet even now, says Jehovah, turn ye to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.
\[13]And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn to Jehovah your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and relents of the evil.
\[14]Who knows whether he will not turn and relent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal offering and a drink offering to Jehovah your God?
\[15]Blow the trumpet in Zion. Sanctify a fast. Call a solemn assembly.
\[16]Gather the people. Sanctify the assembly. Assemble the old men. Gather the sons, and those who suck the breasts. Let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.
\[17]Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Jehovah, and do not give thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them. Why should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?
\[18]Then Jehovah was jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.
\[19]And Jehovah answered and said to his people, Behold, I will send you grain, and new wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith. And I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.
\[20]But I will remove the northern army far off from you, and will drive it into a land barren and desolate, its forepart into the eastern sea, and its rear part into the western sea. And its stench shall come up, and its foul odor shall come up, because it has done great things.
\[21]Fear not, O land. Be glad and rejoice, for Jehovah has done great things.
\[22]Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness spring, for the tree bears its fruit, the fig tree and the vine yield their strength.
\[23]Be glad then, ye sons of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God, for he gives you the former rain in just measure, and he causes the rain to come down for you, the former rain and the latter rain, in the first month.
\[24]And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.
\[25]And I will restore to you the years that the locust, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm has eaten-my great army which I sent among you.
\[26]And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied. And shall praise the name of Jehovah your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And my people shall never be put to shame.
\[27]And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God, and there is none else. And my people shall never be put to shame.
\[28]And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy. Your old men shall dream dreams. Your young men shall see visions.
\[29]And also I will pour out my Spirit upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days.
\[30]And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
\[31]The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and wonderful day of Jehovah comes.
\[32]And it shall come to pass, that whoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be saved. For in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as Jehovah has said, and among the remnant those whom Jehovah calls.

\[2]I will gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat. And I will execute judgment upon them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations. And they have parted my land,
\[3]and have cast lots for my people, and have given a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.
\[4]Yea, and what are ye to me, O Tyre, and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Will ye render me a recompense? And if ye recompense me, I will return your recompense swiftly and speedily upon your own head.
\[5]Inasmuch as ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly precious things,
\[6]and have sold the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem to the sons of the Grecians, that ye may remove them far from their border,
\[7]behold, I will stir them up out of the place where ye have sold them, and will return your recompense upon your own head.
\[8]And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they shall sell them to the men of Sheba, to a nation far off. For Jehovah has spoken it.
\[9]Proclaim ye this among the nations: Prepare war. Stir up the mighty men. Let all the men of war draw near. Let them come up.
\[10]Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning-hooks into spears. Let the weak say, I am strong.
\[11]Hasten ye, and come, all ye nations round about, and gather yourselves together. Cause thy mighty ones to come down there, O Jehovah.
\[12]Let the nations bestir themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit to judge all the nations round about.
\[13]Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, tread ye, for the winepress is full, the vats overflow. For their wickedness is great.
\[14]Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision.
\[15]The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.
\[16]And Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth shall shake. But Jehovah will be a refuge to his people, and a stronghold to the sons of Israel.
\[17]So ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God, dwelling in Zion my holy mountain. Then Jerusalem shall be holy, and no strangers shall pass through her any more.
\[18]And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters. And a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and shall water the valley of Shittim.
\[19]Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence done to the sons of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
\[20]But Judah shall abide forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
\[21]And I will cleanse their blood, that I have not cleansed. For Jehovah dwells in Zion.

\[2]And he said, Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem, and the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.
\[3]Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Damascus, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it, because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron.
\[4]But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.
\[5]And I will break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven, and he who holds the scepter from the house of Eden, and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir, says Jehovah.
\[6]Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Gaza, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it, because they carried away captive the whole people, to deliver them up to Edom.
\[7]But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the palaces of it.
\[8]And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon. And I will turn my hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, says the lord Jehovah.
\[9]Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Tyre, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it, because they delivered up the whole people to Edom, and did not remember the brotherly covenant.
\[10]But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour the palaces of it.
\[11]Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Edom, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it, because he pursued his brother with the sword, and cast off all pity. And his anger tore perpetually, and he kept his wrath forever.
\[12]But I will send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.
\[13]Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it, because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they may enlarge their border.
\[14]But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces of it, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind.

\[3]And I will cut off the judge from the midst of it, and will kill all the rulers of it with him, says Jehovah.
\[4]Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it, because they have rejected the law of Jehovah, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, according to which their fathers walked.
\[5]But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.

\[8]And they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge. And in the house of their God they drink the wine of such as have been fined.
\[9]Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks, yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
\[10]Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.
\[11]And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, O ye sons of Israel? says Jehovah.
\[12]But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, Do not Prophesy.
\[13]Behold, I will press you in your place, as a cart presses that is full of sheaves.
\[14]And flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, nor shall the mighty deliver himself.
\[15]Neither shall he stand who handles the bow. And he who is swift of foot shall not deliver himself, nor shall he who rides the horse deliver himself.

\[4]Will a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey? Will a young lion cry out of his den, if he has taken nothing?
\[5]Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no net is set for him? Shall a snare spring up from the ground, and have taken nothing at all?
\[6]Shall the trumpet be blown in a city, and the people not be afraid? Shall evil befall a city, and Jehovah has not done it?

\[10]For they do not know to do right, says Jehovah, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.
\[11]Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: An adversary shall be, even round about the land, and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be plundered.
\[12]Thus says Jehovah: As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall the sons of Israel be rescued who sit in Samaria in the corner of a couch, and on the silken cushions of a bed.
\[13]Hear ye, and testify against the house of Jacob, says the lord Jehovah, the God of hosts.
\[14]For in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also visit the altars of Bethel, and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.

\[3]And ye shall go out at the breaches, each one straight before her, and ye shall cast yourselves into Harmon, says Jehovah.
\[4]Come to Bethel and transgress, to Gilgal and multiply transgression. And bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes every three days.
\[5]And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened, and proclaim freewill offerings, and publish them. For this pleases you, O ye sons of Israel, says the lord Jehovah.
\[6]And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places, yet ye have not returned to me, says Jehovah.
\[7]And I also have withheld the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest. And I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city. One piece was rained upon, and the piece upon which it did not rain withered.
\[8]So two or three cities wandered to one city to drink water, and were not satisfied. Yet ye have not returned to me, says Jehovah.
\[9]I have smitten you with blasting and mildew. The multitude of your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees the palmer-worm has devoured. Yet ye have not returned to me, says Jehovah.
\[10]I have sent among you the pestilence according to the manner of Egypt. I have slain your young men with the sword, and have carried away your horses, and I have made the stench of your camp to come up even into your nostrils. Yet ye have not returned to me, says Jehovah.
\[11]I have overthrown cities among you, as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a brand plucked out of the burning. Yet ye have not returned to me, says Jehovah.
\[12]Therefore thus I will do to thee, O Israel, and because I will do this to thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.

\[2]The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise. She is cast down upon her land; there is none to raise her up.
\[3]For thus says the lord Jehovah: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left, to the house of Israel.
\[4]For thus says Jehovah to the house of Israel: Seek ye me, and ye shall live.
\[5]But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba. For Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to naught.
\[6]Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live, lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.
\[7]Ye who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth,
\[8]seek him who makes the Pleiades and Orion, and turns the shadow of death into the morning, and makes the day dark with night, who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out upon the face of the earth (Jehovah is his name),
\[9]who brings sudden destruction upon the strong, so that destruction comes upon the fortress.
\[10]They hate him who reproves in the gate, and they abhor him who speaks uprightly.
\[11]Inasmuch therefore as ye trample upon the poor, and take exactions of wheat from him. Ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them. Ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink the wine thereof.
\[12]For I know how manifold are your transgressions, and how mighty are your sins-ye who afflict the just man, who take a bribe, and who turn aside the needy in the gate.
\[13]Therefore he who is prudent shall keep silence in such a time, for it is an evil time.
\[14]Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live, and so Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be with you, as ye say.
\[15]Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the gate. It may be that Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.
\[16]Therefore thus says Jehovah, the God of hosts, the Lord: Wailing shall be in all the broad ways. And they shall say in all the streets, Alas! Alas! And they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful in lamentation to wailing.
\[17]And in all vineyards shall be wailing, for I will pass through the midst of thee, says Jehovah.
\[18]Woe to you who desire the day of Jehovah! Why would ye have the day of Jehovah? It is darkness, and not light.
\[19]As if a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him, or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.
\[20]Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light, even very dark, and no brightness in it?
\[21]I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies.
\[22]Yea, though ye offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings, I will not accept them, nor will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.
\[23]Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs, for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.
\[24]But let justice roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
\[25]Did ye bring sacrifices and offerings to me in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?
\[26]Yea, ye have borne the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, your images which ye made to yourselves.

\[9]And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste, and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.

\[11]For thus Amos says: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.
\[12]Also Amaziah said to Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thou away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there.
\[13]But do not prophesy again any more at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a royal house.
\[14]Then Amos answered, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, nor was I a prophet's son, but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycamore trees.
\[15]And Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said to me, Go, prophesy to my people Israel.
\[16]Now therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: Thou say, Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not drop thy word against the house of Isaac.

\[4]And though they go into captivity before their enemies, from there I will command the sword, and it shall kill them. And I will set my eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.
\[5]For the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, is he who touches the land and it melts, and all who dwell therein shall mourn. And it shall rise up wholly like the River, and shall sink again like the River of Egypt.
\[6]He who builds his chambers in the heavens, and has founded his vault upon the earth, he who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out upon the face of the earth, Jehovah is his name.
\[7]Are ye not as the sons of the Ethiopians to me, O sons of Israel? says Jehovah. Have I not brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?
\[8]Behold, the eyes of the lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth, except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, says Jehovah.
\[9]For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, just as grain is sifted in a sieve, yet the least kernel shall not fall upon the earth.
\[10]All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, The evil shall not overtake nor meet us.
\[11]In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof. And I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old,
\[12]that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations that are called by my name, says Jehovah who does this.
\[13]Behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him who sows seed, and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.
\[14]And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them, and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of it. They shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
\[15]And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them, says Jehovah thy God.

\[2]Behold, I have made thee small among the nations. Thou are greatly despised.
\[3]The pride of thy heart has deceived thee, O thou who dwell in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high, who says in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?
\[4]Though thou mount on high as the eagle, and though thy nest be set among the stars, I will bring thee down from there, says Jehovah.
\[5]If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night (how thou are cut off!), would they not steal only till they had enough? If grape gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes?
\[6]How are the things of Esau searched! How are his hidden treasures sought out!
\[7]All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee on thy way, even to the border. The men who were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee. Those who eat thy bread lay a snare under thee. There is no understanding in him.
\[8]Shall I not in that day, says Jehovah, destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?
\[9]And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that everyone may be cut off from the mount of Esau by slaughter.
\[10]Shame shall cover thee for the violence done to thy brother Jacob, and thou shall be cut off forever.
\[11]In the day that thou stood on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away his substance, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou were as one of them.
\[12]But look not thou on the day of thy brother in the day of his disaster, and rejoice not over the sons of Judah in the day of their destruction, nor speak proudly in the day of distress.
\[13]Enter not into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity. Yea, look not thou on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor lay ye hands on their substance in the day of their calamity.
\[14]And stand thou not in the crossway, to cut off those of his who escape, and deliver not up those of his who remain in the day of distress.
\[15]For the day of Jehovah is near upon all the nations. As thou have done, it shall be done to thee. Thy dealing shall return upon thine own head.
\[16]For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the nations drink continually. Yea, they shall drink, and swallow down, and shall be as though they had not been.
\[17]But in mount Zion there shall be those who escape, and it shall be holy, and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.
\[18]And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble. And they shall burn among them, and devour them, and there shall not be any remaining to the house of Esau, for Jehovah has spoken it.
\[19]And those of the South shall possess the mount of Esau, and those of the lowland the Philistines. And they shall possess the field of Ephraim, and the field of Samaria, and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.
\[20]And the captives of this host of the sons of Israel, who are among the Canaanites, shall possess even to Zarephath. And the captives of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad shall possess the cities of the South.
\[21]And saviors shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau, and the kingdom shall be Jehovah's.

ow the word of Jehovah came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,
\[2]Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it, for their wickedness has come up before me.
\[3]But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah. And he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare of it, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah.
\[4]But Jehovah sent out a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was about to be broken.
\[5]Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man to his god. And they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it to them. But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship, and he lay, and was fast asleep.
\[6]So the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, What do thou mean, O sleeper? Arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we not perish.
\[7]And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.
\[8]Then they said to him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us. What is thine occupation? And from where do thou come? What is thy country, and of what people are thou?
\[9]And he said to them, I am a Hebrew, and I fear Jehovah, the God of heaven, who has made the sea and the dry land.
\[10]Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and said to him, What is this that thou have done? For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Jehovah, because he had told them.
\[11]Then they said to him, What shall we do to thee, that the sea may be calm to us? For the sea grew more and more tempestuous.
\[12]And he said to them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea, so shall the sea be calm to you. For I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.
\[13]Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get themselves back to the land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.
\[14]Therefore they cried to Jehovah, and said, We beseech thee, O Jehovah, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood. For thou, O Jehovah, have done as it pleased thee.
\[15]So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging.
\[16]Then the men feared Jehovah exceedingly, and they offered a sacrifice to Jehovah, and made vows.
\[17]And Jehovah prepared a great sea creature to swallow up Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the sea creature three days and three nights.

\[3]For thou cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, and the flood was round about me. All thy waves and thy billows passed over me.
\[4]And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes. Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.
\[5]The waters encompassed me around, even to the soul. The deep was round about me. The weeds were wrapped around my head.
\[6]I went down to the bottoms of the mountains. The earth with its bars closed upon me forever. Yet thou have brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God.
\[7]When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah. And my prayer came in to thee, into thy holy temple.
\[8]Those who regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy.

\[8]but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily to God. Yea, let them turn each one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands.

\[3]Therefore now, O Jehovah, I beseech thee, take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.
\[4]And Jehovah said, Do thou well to be angry?
\[5]Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made himself a booth, and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city.
\[6]And Jehovah God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his misery. So Jonah was very glad because of the gourd.
\[7]But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered.
\[8]And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind, and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.
\[9]And God said to Jonah, Do thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even to death.
\[10]And Jehovah said, Thou have had regard for the gourd, for which thou have not labored, nor made it grow, which came up in a night, and perished in a night.

\[2]Hear, ye peoples, all of you. Hearken, O earth, and all who are in it, and let the Lord Jehovah be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.
\[3]For, behold, Jehovah comes forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.
\[4]And the mountains shall be melted under him, and the valleys shall be split, as wax before the fire, as waters that are poured down a steep place.
\[5]All this is for the transgression of Jacob, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what are the high places of Judah? Are they not Jerusalem?
\[6]Therefore I will make Samaria as a heap of the field, and as places for planting vineyards. And I will pour down the stones of it into the valley, and I will uncover the foundations of it.
\[7]And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces. And all her wages shall be burned with fire, and I will lay desolate all her idols. For she has gathered them from the wages of a harlot, and to the wage of a harlot they shall return.
\[8]For this I will lament and wail. I will go stripped and naked. I will make a wailing like the jackals, and a lamentation like the ostriches.
\[9]For her wounds are incurable. For it has come even to Judah. it reaches to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
\[10]Tell it not in Gath. Weep not at all. I have rolled myself in the dust at Beth-le-aphrah.
\[11]Pass away, O inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame. The inhabitant of Zaanan has not come forth. The wailing of Beth-ezel shall take from you the stay of it.
\[12]For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good, because evil has come down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem.
\[13]Bind the chariot to the swift steed, O inhabitant of Lachish. She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion, for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.
\[14]Therefore thou shall give a parting gift to Moresheth-gath. The houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel.
\[15]I will yet bring to thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah, him who shall possess thee. The glory of Israel shall come even to Adullam.

\[4]In that day they shall take up a taunt against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation. And say, We are utterly ruined. He changes the portion of my people. How he removes it from me! He divides our fields to the rebellious.

\[8]But of late my people have risen up as an enemy. Ye strip off the robe with the garment from those who pass by securely as men turning back from war.
\[9]Ye cast out the women of my people from their pleasant houses. Ye take away my glory from their young sons forever.

\[20]Thou will perform the truth to Jacob, and the loving kindness to Abraham, which thou have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.

\[2]Jehovah is a jealous God and avenges. Jehovah avenges and is full of wrath. Jehovah takes vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserves wrath for his enemies.
\[3]Jehovah is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means clear the guilty. Jehovah has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.
\[4]He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers. Bashan languishes, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languishes.
\[5]The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is up heaved at his presence. Yea, the world, and all who dwell therein.
\[6]Who can stand before his indignation? And who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken apart by him.
\[7]Jehovah is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble, and he knows those who take refuge in him.
\[8]But with an over running flood he will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.
\[9]What do ye devise against Jehovah? He will make a full end. Affliction shall not rise up the second time.
\[10]For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed utterly as dry stubble.
\[11]He has gone forth out of thee, who devises evil against Jehovah, who counsels wickedness.
\[12]Thus says Jehovah: Though they be in full strength, and likewise many, even so they shall be cut down. And he shall pass away. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.
\[13]And now I will break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds apart.
\[14]And Jehovah has given commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown. Out of the house of thy gods I will cut off the graven image and the molten image. I will make thy grave, for thou are vile.
\[15]Behold, upon the mountains the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace! Keep thy feasts, O Judah. Perform thy vows, for the wicked one shall no more pass through thee. He is utterly cut off.

\[2]For Jehovah restores the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel, for the emptiers have emptied them out, and destroyed their vine-branches.
\[3]The shield of his mighty men is made red. The valiant men are in scarlet. The chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the cypress spears are brandished.
\[4]The chariots rage in the streets; they rush to and fro in the broad ways. The appearance of them is like torches. They run like the lightnings.

\[2]O Jehovah, how long shall I cry, and thou will not hear? I cry out to thee of violence, and thou will not save.
\[3]Why do thou show me iniquity, and look upon perverseness? For destruction and violence are before me, and there is strife, and contention rises up.
\[4]Therefore the law is slacked, and justice never goes forth. For the wicked man surrounds the righteous man, therefore justice goes forth perverted.
\[5]Behold ye scoffers, and look, and wonder marvelously. For I am working a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you.
\[6]For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, who march through the breadth of the earth to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.
\[7]They are fearful and dreadful. Their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.
\[8]Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves. And their horsemen press proudly on. Yea, their horsemen come from far. They fly as an eagle that hastens to devour.
\[9]They come all of them for violence. The set of their faces is forwards, and they gather captives as the sand.
\[10]Yea, he scoffs at kings, and rulers are a derision to him. He derides every stronghold, for he heaps up dust, and takes it.
\[11]Then he shall sweep by as a wind, and shall pass over, and be guilty; he whose might is his god.
\[12]Are not thou from everlasting, O Jehovah my God, my Holy One? We shall not die. O Jehovah, thou have ordained him for judgment, and thou, O Rock, have established him for correction.
\[13]Thou who are of purer eyes than to behold evil, and who cannot look on perverseness, why do thou look upon those who deal treacherously, and hold thy peace when the wicked man swallows up the man who is more righteous than he,
\[14]and makes men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?
\[15]He takes all of them up with the hook. He catches them in his net, and gathers them in his drag. Therefore he rejoices and is glad.

\[5]Yea, moreover, wine is treacherous.) He is a haughty man, who does not keep at home, who enlarges his desire as Sheol, and he is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathers to him all nations, and heaps to him all peoples.

\[7]Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee. And thou shall be for booty to them?
\[8]Because thou have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder thee, because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell therein.
\[9]Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!
\[10]Thou have devised shame to thy house, by cutting off many peoples, and have sinned against thy soul.
\[11]For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
\[12]Woe to him who builds a town with blood, and establishes a city by iniquity!
\[13]Behold, is it not of Jehovah of hosts that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?
\[14]For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.
\[15]Woe to him who gives his neighbor drink, who adds thy venom, and also makes him drunken, that thou may look on their nakedness!
\[16]Thou are filled with shame, and not glory. Drink thou also, and be as one uncircumcised. The cup of Jehovah's right hand shall come around to thee, and foul shame shall be upon thy glory.
\[17]For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee and the plunder of the beasts (which made them afraid), because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell therein.
\[18]What profits the graven image, that the maker of it has engraved it, the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he who fashions its form trusts in it, to make dumb idols?
\[19]Woe to him who says to the wood, Awake, to the dumb stone, Arise! Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.

\[2]O Jehovah, I have heard the report of thee, and am afraid. O Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years. In the midst of the years make it known. In wrath remember mercy.
\[3]God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.
\[4]And his brightness was as the light. He had rays from his hand, and there was the hiding of his power.
\[5]Before him went the pestilence. And fiery bolts went forth at his feet.
\[6]He stood, and measured the earth. He beheld, and drove apart the nations. And the eternal mountains were scattered. The everlasting hills bowed. His goings were as of old.
\[7]I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction. The curtains of the land of Midian trembled.
\[8]Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers? Was thine anger against the rivers, or thy wrath against the sea, that thou rode upon thy horses, upon thy chariots of salvation?
\[9]Thy bow was made quite bare. The oaths to the tribes were a sure word. Selah. Thou split the earth with rivers.
\[10]The mountains saw thee, and were afraid. The tempest of waters passed by. The deep uttered its voice, and lifted up its hands on high.
\[11]The sun and moon stood still in their habitation, at the light of thine arrows as they went, at the shining of thy glittering spear.
\[12]Thou marched though the land in indignation. Thou threshed the nations in anger.
\[13]Thou went forth for the salvation of thy people, for the salvation of thine anointed. Thou wound the head out of the house of the wicked man, laying bare the foundation even to the neck. Selah.
\[14]Thou pierced with his own staves the head of his warriors. They came as a whirlwind to scatter me. Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor man secretly.
\[15]Thou walked through the sea with thy horses, the heap of mighty waters.
\[16]I heard, and my body trembled. My lips quivered at the voice. Rottenness enters into my bones, and I tremble in my place, because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble, for the coming up of the people who invade us.
\[17]For though the fig tree shall not flourish, nor shall fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no food; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls;
\[18]yet I will rejoice in Jehovah. I will joy in the God of my salvation.
\[19]Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength. And he makes my feet like hinds' feet, and will make me to walk upon my high places.

\[3]I will consume man and beast. I will consume the birds of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the wicked. And I will cut off man from off the face of the ground, says Jehovah.
\[4]And I will stretch out my hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarim with the priests,
\[5]and those who worship the host of heaven upon the housetops, and those who worship, who swear to Jehovah and swear by Malcam,
\[6]and those who are turned back from following Jehovah, and those who have not sought Jehovah, nor inquired after him.
\[7]Hold thy peace at the presence of the lord Jehovah, for the day of Jehovah is at hand. For Jehovah has prepared a sacrifice. He has consecrated his guests.
\[8]And it shall come to pass in the day of Jehovah's sacrifice, that I will punish the rulers, and the king's sons, and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel.
\[9]And in that day I will punish all those who leap over the threshold, who fill their master's house with violence and deceit.
\[10]And in that day, says Jehovah, there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and a wailing from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills.
\[11]Wail, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the people of Canaan are undone. All those who were laden with silver are cut off.
\[12]And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the men who are settled on their lees, who say in their heart, Jehovah will not do good, nor will he do evil.
\[13]And their wealth shall become a spoil, and their houses a desolation. Yea, they shall build houses, but shall not inhabit them, and they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the wine of it.
\[14]The great day of Jehovah is near. It is near and hastens greatly, the voice of the day of Jehovah. The mighty man cries there bitterly.
\[15]That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
\[16]a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fortified cities, and against the high battlements.
\[17]And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against Jehovah, and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung.
\[18]Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovah's wrath, but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy. For he will make an end, yea, a terrible end, of all those who dwell in the land.

\[2]Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, saying, This people say, It is not the time for us to come, the time for Jehovah's house to be built.
\[3]Then the word of Jehovah came by Haggai the prophet, saying,
\[4]Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses while this house lies waste?
\[5]Now therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways.
\[6]Ye have sown much, and bring in little. Ye eat, but ye have not enough. Ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink. Ye clothe yourselves, but there is none warm. And he who earns wages earns wages to put into a bag with holes.
\[7]Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways.
\[8]Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house. And I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, says Jehovah.
\[9]Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little, and when ye brought it home, I blew upon it. Why? says Jehovah of hosts. Because of my house that lays waste while ye run each man to his own house.
\[10]Therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew, and the earth withholds its fruit.
\[11]And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the grain, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground brings forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labor of the hands.
\[12]Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of Jehovah their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as Jehovah their God had sent him. And the people feared before Jehovah.
\[13]Then Haggai, Jehovah's agent, spoke in Jehovah's message to the people, saying, I am with you, says Jehovah.
\[14]And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and did work on the house of Jehovah of hosts, their God,

\[2]Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
\[3]Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? And how do ye see it now? Is it not in your eyes as nothing?
\[4]Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, says Jehovah, and be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and be strong, all ye people of the land, says Jehovah, and work. For I am with you, says Jehovah of hosts,
\[5]according to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, and my Spirit abode among you. Fear ye not.
\[6]For thus says Jehovah of hosts: Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land.
\[7]And I will shake all nations, and the precious things of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory, says Jehovah of hosts.
\[8]The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says Jehovah of hosts.
\[9]The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, says Jehovah of hosts, and in this place I will give peace, says Jehovah of hosts.
\[10]In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of Jehovah came by Haggai the prophet, saying,
\[11]Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,
\[12]If a man bears holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt touches bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
\[13]Then Haggai said, If a man who is unclean because of a dead body touches any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.
\[14]Then Haggai answered and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, says Jehovah, and so is every work of their hands. And that which they offer there is unclean.
\[15]And now, I pray you, consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of Jehovah.
\[16]Through all that time, when a man came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten. When he came to the wine vat to draw out fifty vessels, there were but twenty.
\[17]I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands, yet ye turned not to me, says Jehovah.
\[18]Consider, I pray you, from this day and backward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, since the day that the foundation of Jehovah's temple was laid, consider it.
\[19]Is the seed yet in the barn? Yea, the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not brought forth. From this day I will bless you.

n the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,
\[2]Jehovah was greatly displeased with your fathers.
\[3]Therefore say thou to them, Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Return to me, says Jehovah of hosts, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of hosts.
\[4]Be ye not as your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried, saying, Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Return ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings, but they did not hear, nor hearken to me, says Jehovah.
\[5]Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?
\[6]But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? And they turned and said, Like as Jehovah of hosts thought to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so he has dealt with us.
\[7]Upon the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,
\[8]I saw in the night, and, behold, a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom. And behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.
\[9]Then I said, O my lord, what are these? And the agent who talked with me said to me, I will show thee what these are.
\[10]And the man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom Jehovah has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.
\[11]And they answered the agent of Jehovah who stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits still, and is at rest.
\[12]Then the agent of Jehovah answered and said, O Jehovah of hosts, how long will thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou have had indignation these seventy years?
\[13]And Jehovah answered the agent who talked with me with good words, comforting words.
\[14]So the agent who talked with me said to me, Cry thou, saying, Thus says Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.
\[15]And I am very greatly displeased with the nations that are at ease. For I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.
\[16]Therefore thus says Jehovah: I have returned to Jerusalem with mercies. My house shall be built in it, says Jehovah of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.
\[17]Cry yet again, saying, Thus says Jehovah of hosts: My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity, and Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
\[18]And I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, four horns.
\[19]And I said to the agent who talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
\[20]And Jehovah showed me four smiths.
\[21]Then I said, What are these coming to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head. But these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.

\[3]And, behold, the agent who talked with me went forth. And another agent went out to meet him,
\[4]and said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of men and cattle therein.
\[5]For I, says Jehovah, will be to her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.
\[6]Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, says Jehovah. For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, says Jehovah.
\[7]Ho Zion, escape, thou who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.
\[8]For thus says Jehovah of hosts: After glory he has sent me to the nations which plundered you. For he who touches you touches the apple of his eye.
\[9]For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those who served them. And ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me.
\[10]Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, says Jehovah.
\[11]And many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that day, and shall be my people, and I will dwell in the midst of thee. And thou shall know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me to thee.
\[12]And Jehovah shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.

\[3]Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the agent.
\[4]And he answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. And to him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with rich apparel.
\[5]And I said, Let them set a clean miter upon his head. So they set a clean miter upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the agent of Jehovah was standing by.
\[6]And the agent of Jehovah testified to Joshua, saying,
\[7]Thus says Jehovah of hosts: If thou will walk in my ways, and if thou will keep my charge, then thou also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give thee a place of access among these who stand by.
\[8]Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows who sit before thee, for they are men who are a sign. For, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch.
\[9]For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua. Upon one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave the graving of it, says Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.

\[3]and to speak to the priests of the house of Jehovah of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?
\[4]Then the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me, saying,
\[5]Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month, even these seventy years, did ye at all fast to me, even to me?
\[6]And when ye eat, and when ye drink, do ye not eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?
\[7]Should ye not hear the words which Jehovah cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?

\[9]Thus Jehovah of hosts has spoken, saying, Execute true justice, and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother.
\[10]And do not oppress the widow, nor the fatherless, the sojourner, nor the poor man. And let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.

\[12]Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which Jehovah of hosts had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets. Therefore great wrath came from Jehovah of hosts.
\[13]And it has come to pass that, as he cried, and they would not hear, so they shall cry, and I will not hear, said Jehovah of hosts.

\[5]And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets of it.

\[8]And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.
\[9]Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye who hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets who were in the day that the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might be built.
\[10]For before those days there was no wage for man, nor any wage for beast, nor was there any peace to him who went out or came in, because of the adversary. For I set all men each one against his neighbor.

\[13]And it shall come to pass that, as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and ye shall be a blessing. Fear not. Let your hands be strong.
\[14]For thus says Jehovah of hosts: As I thought to do evil to you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, says Jehovah of hosts, and I did not relent,

\[13]And Jehovah said to me, Cast it to the potter, the good price that I was valued by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of Jehovah.
\[14]Then I cut apart my other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
\[15]And Jehovah said to me, Take to thee yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd.
\[16]For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those who are cut off, nor will he seek those who are scattered, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is sound, but he will eat the flesh of the fat, and will tear their hoofs in pieces.

\[7]Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man who is my companion, says Jehovah of hosts. Smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. And I will turn my hand upon the little ones.
\[8]And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, says Jehovah, two parts therein shall be cut off and die, but the third shall be left in it.
\[9]And I will bring the third part into the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on my name, and I will hear them. I will say, It is my people, and they shall say, Jehovah is my God.

ehold, a day of Jehovah comes when thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.
\[2]For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle. And the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished, and half of the city shall go forth into captivity. And the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
\[3]Then Jehovah shall go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.
\[4]And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east. And the mount of Olives shall be split in the midst of it toward the east and toward the west, a very great valley. And half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.
\[5]And ye shall flee by the valley of my mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azel. Yea, ye shall flee, just as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. And Jehovah my God shall come, and all the holy ones with thee.
\[6]And it shall come to pass in that day, that there shall not be light; the bright ones shall withdraw themselves.
\[7]But it shall be one day which is known to Jehovah, not day, and not night. But it shall come to pass, that at evening time there shall be light.
\[8]And it shall come to pass in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea. In summer and in winter it shall be.
\[9]And Jehovah shall be King over all the earth. In that day Jehovah shall be one, and his name one.
\[10]All the land shall be made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. And she shall be lifted up, and shall dwell in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel to the king's wine-presses.
\[11]And men shall dwell therein, and there shall be no more curse, but Jerusalem shall dwell safely.
\[12]And this shall be the plague with which Jehovah will smite all the peoples who have warred against Jerusalem: their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their sockets, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.
\[13]And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from Jehovah shall be among them, and they shall lay hold each one on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.
\[14]And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem. And the wealth of all the nations round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.
\[15]And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the donkey, and of all the beasts that shall be in those camps, as that plague.
\[16]And it shall come to pass, that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.
\[17]And it shall be, that of the families of the earth he who does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, upon them there shall be no rain.
\[18]And if the family of Egypt does not go up, and does not come, that there shall be the plague with which Jehovah will smite the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
\[19]This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
\[20]In that day there shall be upon the bells of the horses, HOLY TO JEHOVAH, and the pots in Jehovah's house shall be like the bowls before the altar.
\[21]Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy to Jehovah of hosts. And all those who sacrifice shall come and take of them, and boil in it. And in that day there shall be no more a Canaanite in the house of Jehovah of hosts.

he burden of the word of Jehovah to Israel by Malachi.
\[2]I have loved you, says Jehovah. Yet ye say, How have thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother, says Jehovah. Yet I loved Jacob,
\[3]but Esau I regarded inferior, and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.
\[4]Whereas Edom says, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places, thus says Jehovah of hosts: They shall build, but I will throw down, and men shall call them the border of wickedness, and the people against whom Jehovah has indignation forever.
\[5]And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, Jehovah be magnified beyond the border of Israel.
\[6]A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is my fear? says Jehovah of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. And ye say, How have we despised thy name?
\[7]Ye offer polluted bread upon my altar. And ye say, How have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible.
\[8]And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, ye say, It is no evil! and when ye offer the lame and sick, It is no evil! Present it now to thy governor. Will he be pleased with thee, or will he accept thy person? says Jehovah of hosts.
\[9]Ye say, And now, I pray you, entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us; this has been by your means. Will he accept any of your persons? says Jehovah of hosts.
\[10]Oh that there was among you who would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says Jehovah of hosts, nor will I accept an offering at your hand.
\[11]For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same, my name is great among the Gentiles. And in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure offering. For my name is great among the Gentiles, says Jehovah of hosts.
\[12]But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of Jehovah is polluted. And the fruit of it, even its food, is contemptible.
\[13]Ye also say, Behold, what a weariness it is! And ye have sniffed at it, says Jehovah of hosts. And ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick. Thus ye bring the offering. Should I accept this at your hand? says Jehovah.
\[14]But cursed be the deceiver, who has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing. For I am a great King, says Jehovah of hosts, and my name is feared among the Gentiles.

nd now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.
\[2]If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory to my name, says Jehovah of hosts, then I will send the curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings. Yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.
\[3]Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your feasts, and ye shall be taken away with it.
\[4]And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant may be with Levi, says Jehovah of hosts.
\[5]My covenant of life and peace was with him. And I gave them to him that he might fear, and he feared me, and stood in awe of my name.
\[6]The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.
\[7]For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth. For he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts.
\[8]But ye are turned aside out of the way. Ye have caused many to stumble in the law. Ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says Jehovah of hosts.
\[9]Therefore I also have made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have had respect of persons in the law.
\[10]Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?
\[11]Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the holiness of Jehovah which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
\[12]Jehovah will cut off out of the tents of Jacob, the man who does this: him who wakes, and him who answers, and him who offers an offering to Jehovah of hosts.
\[13]And this again ye do: Ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that he does not regard the offering any more, nor receives it with good will at your hand.
\[14]Yet ye say, Why? Because Jehovah has been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou have dealt treacherously, though she is thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.
\[15]And did he not make one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? And why one? He sought a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
\[16]For I hate putting away, says Jehovah, the God of Israel, and him who covers his garment with violence, says Jehovah of hosts. Therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.
\[17]Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words. Yet ye say, How have we wearied him? In that ye say, Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of Jehovah, and he delights in them, or Where is the God of justice?

ehold, I send my agent, and he shall prepare the way before me. And the Lord, whom ye seek, will suddenly come to his temple. And the messenger of the covenant, whom ye desire, behold, he comes, says Jehovah of hosts.
\[2]But who can abide the day of his coming? And who shall stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap.
\[3]And he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver. And he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver. And they shall offer to Jehovah offerings in righteousness.
\[4]Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasant to Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.
\[5]And I will come near to you to judgment, and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the false swearers, and against those who oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and who turn aside the sojourner, and do not fear me, says Jehovah of hosts.
\[6]For I, Jehovah, do not change. Therefore ye, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed.
\[7]From the days of your fathers ye have turned aside from my ordinances, and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of hosts. But ye say, How shall we return?
\[8]Will a man rob God? Yet ye rob me. But ye say, How have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.
\[9]Ye are cursed with the curse, for ye rob me, even this whole nation.
\[10]Bring ye the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now with this, says Jehovah of hosts, if I will not open to you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough for it.
\[11]And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground, nor shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, says Jehovah of hosts.
\[12]And all nations shall call you blessed, for ye shall be a delightful land, says Jehovah of hosts.
\[13]Your words have been stout against me, says Jehovah. Yet ye say, What have we spoken against thee?
\[14]Ye have said, It is vain to serve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?
\[15]And now we call the proud happy. Yea, those who work wickedness are built up. Yea, they challenge God, and escape.
\[16]Then those who feared Jehovah spoke one with another, and Jehovah hearkened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him, for those who feared Jehovah, and who thought upon his name.
\[17]And they shall be mine, says Jehovah of hosts, my own possession, in the day that I make. And I will spare them, as a man spares his own son who serves him.
\[18]Then ye shall return and discern between the righteous man and the wicked man, between him who serves God and him who does not serve him.

or, behold, the day comes, it burns as a furnace, and all the proud, and all who work wickedness, shall be stubble. And the day that comes shall burn them up, says Jehovah of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
\[2]But to you who fear my name the sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in its wings, and ye shall go forth, and frolic as calves of the stall.
\[3]And ye shall tread down the wicked, for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make, says Jehovah of hosts.
\[4]Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances.
\[5]Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and fearful day of Jehovah comes.
\[6]And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the sons, and the heart of the sons to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
