n the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
\[2]And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters.
\[3]And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
\[4]And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
\[5]And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
\[6]And God said, Let there be a firmament in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
\[7]And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
\[8]And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
\[9]And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
\[10]And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
\[11]And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth: and it was so.
\[12]And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
\[13]And the evening and the morning were the third day.
\[14]And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
\[15]And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light on the earth: and it was so.
\[16]And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
\[17]And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light on the earth,
\[18]And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
\[19]And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
\[20]And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that has life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
\[21]And God created great whales, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
\[22]And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
\[23]And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
\[24]And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
\[25]And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creeps on the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
\[26]And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.
\[27]So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
\[28]And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.
\[29]And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
\[30]And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creeps on the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
\[31]And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

hus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
\[2]And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
\[3]And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
\[4]These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
\[5]And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.
\[6]But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
\[7]And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
\[8]And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
\[9]And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the middle of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
\[10]And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became into four heads.
\[11]The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasses the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
\[12]And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
\[13]And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasses the whole land of Ethiopia.
\[14]And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goes toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
\[15]And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
\[16]And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat:
\[17]But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it: for in the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die.
\[18]And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.
\[19]And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: and whatever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
\[20]And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
\[21]And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
\[22]And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her to the man.
\[23]And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
\[24]Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
\[25]And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

ow the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, Yes, has God said, You shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
\[2]And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
\[3]But of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.
\[4]And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not surely die:
\[5]For God does know that in the day you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
\[6]And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also to her husband with her; and he did eat.
\[7]And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
\[8]And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
\[9]And the LORD God called to Adam, and said to him, Where are you?
\[10]And he said, I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
\[11]And he said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded you that you should not eat?
\[12]And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
\[13]And the LORD God said to the woman, What is this that you have done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
\[14]And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, you are cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; on your belly shall you go, and dust shall you eat all the days of your life:
\[15]And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.
\[16]To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.
\[17]And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life;
\[18]Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to you; and you shall eat the herb of the field;
\[19]In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, till you return to the ground; for out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and to dust shall you return.
\[20]And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
\[21]To Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
\[22]And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
\[23]Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from from where he was taken.
\[24]So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

nd Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.
\[2]And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
\[3]And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD.
\[4]And Abel, he also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect to Abel and to his offering:
\[5]But to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
\[6]And the LORD said to Cain, Why are you wroth? and why is your countenance fallen?
\[7]If you do well, shall you not be accepted? and if you do not well, sin lies at the door. And to you shall be his desire, and you shall rule over him.
\[8]And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
\[9]And the LORD said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?
\[10]And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground.
\[11]And now are you cursed from the earth, which has opened her mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand;
\[12]When you till the ground, it shall not from now on yield to you her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shall you be in the earth.
\[13]And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
\[14]Behold, you have driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from your face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that finds me shall slay me.
\[15]And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark on Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
\[16]And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelled in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
\[17]And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
\[18]And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
\[19]And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
\[20]And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.
\[21]And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
\[22]And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.
\[23]And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
\[24]If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
\[25]And Adam knew his wife again; and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
\[26]And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call on the name of the LORD.

\[3]And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
\[4]There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
\[5]And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
\[6]And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
\[7]And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repents me that I have made them.
\[8]But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
\[9]These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
\[10]And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

\[12]And God looked on the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way on the earth.
\[13]And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
\[14]Make you an ark of gopher wood; rooms shall you make in the ark, and shall pitch it within and without with pitch.
\[15]And this is the fashion which you shall make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
\[16]A window shall you make to the ark, and in a cubit shall you finish it above; and the door of the ark shall you set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shall you make it.
\[17]And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters on the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
\[18]But with you will I establish my covenant; and you shall come into the ark, you, and your sons, and your wife, and your sons' wives with you.
\[19]And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shall you bring into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.
\[20]Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come to you, to keep them alive.

\[15]And they went in to Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.
\[16]And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.

\[18]And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly on the earth; and the ark went on the face of the waters.
\[19]And the waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
\[20]Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
\[21]And all flesh died that moved on the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man:
\[22]All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.
\[23]And every living substance was destroyed which was on the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.

\[19]Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatever creeps on the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.
\[20]And Noah built an altar to the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
\[21]And the LORD smelled a sweet smell; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.

\[20]And Noah began to be an farmer, and he planted a vineyard:
\[21]And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
\[22]And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers without.
\[23]And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
\[24]And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done to him.
\[25]And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be to his brothers.
\[26]And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

\[8]And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
\[9]He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: why it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.
\[10]And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
\[11]Out of that land went forth Asshur, and built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,
\[12]And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.

\[4]And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the face of the whole earth.
\[5]And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.
\[6]And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
\[7]Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.
\[8]So the LORD scattered them abroad from there on the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
\[9]Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from there did the LORD scatter them abroad on the face of all the earth.

\[28]And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
\[29]And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
\[30]But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
\[31]And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelled there.

\[3]And I will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curses you: and in you shall all families of the earth be blessed.

\[5]And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
\[6]And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
\[7]And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To your seed will I give this land: and there built he an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.
\[8]And he removed from there to a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he built an altar to the LORD, and called on the name of the LORD.
\[9]And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
\[10]And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
\[11]And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that you are a fair woman to look on:
\[12]Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see you, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save you alive.
\[13]Say, I pray you, you are my sister: that it may be well with me for your sake; and my soul shall live because of you.
\[14]And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
\[15]The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
\[16]And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
\[17]And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.
\[18]And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that you have done to me? why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
\[19]Why said you, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold your wife, take her, and go your way.

\[3]And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;
\[4]To the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
\[5]And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
\[6]And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
\[7]And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
\[8]And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray you, between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we be brothers.
\[9]Is not the whole land before you? separate yourself, I pray you, from me: if you will take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if you depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
\[10]And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as you come to Zoar.
\[11]Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
\[12]Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.
\[13]But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.
\[14]And the LORD said to Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now your eyes, and look from the place where you are northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:
\[15]For all the land which you see, to you will I give it, and to your seed for ever.
\[16]And I will make your seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall your seed also be numbered.
\[17]Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to you.
\[18]Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelled in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to the LORD.

\[8]And I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land wherein you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.

\[11]And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant between me and you.
\[12]And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of your seed.
\[13]He that is born in your house, and he that is bought with your money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
\[14]And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.

\[16]And I will bless her, and give you a son also of her: yes, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.

\[19]For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.

\[21]I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know.
\[22]And the men turned their faces from there, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.
\[23]And Abraham drew near, and said, Will you also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
\[24]Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: will you also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
\[25]That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?

\[27]And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken on me to speak to the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:
\[28]Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: will you destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.
\[29]And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.
\[30]And he said to him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
\[31]And he said, Behold now, I have taken on me to speak to the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.
\[32]And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.
\[33]And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.

nd there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
\[2]And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and you shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, No; but we will abide in the street all night.
\[3]And he pressed on them greatly; and they turned in to him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
\[4]But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
\[5]And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men which came in to you this night? bring them out to us, that we may know them.
\[6]And Lot went out at the door to them, and shut the door after him,
\[7]And said, I pray you, brothers, do not so wickedly.
\[8]Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do you to them as is good in your eyes: only to these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
\[9]And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with you, than with them. And they pressed sore on the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
\[10]But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
\[11]And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
\[12]And the men said to Lot, Have you here any besides? son in law, and your sons, and your daughters, and whatever you have in the city, bring them out of this place:
\[13]For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD has sent us to destroy it.
\[14]And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked to his sons in law.
\[15]And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take your wife, and your two daughters, which are here; lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
\[16]And while he lingered, the men laid hold on his hand, and on the hand of his wife, and on the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful to him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
\[17]And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for your life; look not behind you, neither stay you in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest you be consumed.
\[18]And Lot said to them, Oh, not so, my LORD:
\[19]Behold now, your servant has found grace in your sight, and you have magnified your mercy, which you have showed to me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
\[20]Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
\[21]And he said to him, See, I have accepted you concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which you have spoken.
\[22]Haste you, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till you be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
\[23]The sun was risen on the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
\[24]Then the LORD rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
\[25]And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.
\[26]But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
\[27]And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:
\[28]And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, see, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
\[29]And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelled.
\[30]And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelled in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelled in a cave, he and his two daughters.
\[31]And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth:
\[32]Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
\[33]And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
\[34]And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said to the younger, Behold, I lay last night with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go you in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
\[35]And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
\[36]Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
\[37]And the first born bore a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites to this day.
\[38]And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.

nd Abraham journeyed from there toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
\[2]And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
\[3]But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, you are but a dead man, for the woman which you have taken; for she is a man's wife.
\[4]But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, will you slay also a righteous nation?
\[5]Said he not to me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands have I done this.
\[6]And God said to him in a dream, Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart; for I also withheld you from sinning against me: therefore suffered I you not to touch her.
\[7]Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for you, and you shall live: and if you restore her not, know you that you shall surely die, you, and all that are yours.
\[8]Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
\[9]Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What have you done to us? and what have I offended you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? you have done deeds to me that ought not to be done.
\[10]And Abimelech said to Abraham, What saw you, that you have done this thing?
\[11]And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.
\[12]And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
\[13]And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This is your kindness which you shall show to me; at every place where we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
\[14]And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.
\[15]And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before you: dwell where it pleases you.
\[16]And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to you a covering of the eyes, to all that are with you, and with all other: thus she was reproved.
\[17]So Abraham prayed to God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bore children.
\[18]For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.

nd the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had spoken.
\[2]For Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
\[3]And Abraham called the name of his son that was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
\[4]And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
\[5]And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born to him.
\[6]And Sarah said, God has made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.
\[7]And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.
\[8]And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.
\[9]And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born to Abraham, mocking.
\[10]Why she said to Abraham, Cast out this female slave and her son: for the son of this female slave shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
\[11]And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.
\[12]And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in your sight because of the lad, and because of your female slave; in all that Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice; for in Isaac shall your seed be called.
\[13]And also of the son of the female slave will I make a nation, because he is your seed.
\[14]And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
\[15]And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
\[16]And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
\[17]And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, What ails you, Hagar? fear not; for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.
\[18]Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in your hand; for I will make him a great nation.
\[19]And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
\[20]And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelled in the wilderness, and became an archer.
\[21]And he dwelled in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
\[22]And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with you in all that you do:
\[23]Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land wherein you have sojourned.
\[24]And Abraham said, I will swear.
\[25]And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
\[26]And Abimelech said, I know not who has done this thing; neither did you tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.
\[27]And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.
\[28]And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
\[29]And Abimelech said to Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?
\[30]And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shall you take of my hand, that they may be a witness to me, that I have dig this well.
\[31]Why he called that place Beersheba; because there they swore both of them.
\[32]Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
\[33]And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.
\[34]And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.

\[2]And he said, Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and get you into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.
\[3]And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.
\[4]Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
\[5]And Abraham said to his young men, Abide you here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
\[6]And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
\[7]And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
\[8]And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
\[9]And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar on the wood.
\[10]And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
\[11]And the angel of the LORD called to him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
\[12]And he said, Lay not your hand on the lad, neither do you any thing to him: for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son from me.
\[13]And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
\[14]And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.
\[15]And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham out of heaven the second time,
\[16]And said, By myself have I sworn, said the LORD, for because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son:
\[17]That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
\[18]And in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because you have obeyed my voice.
\[19]So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelled at Beersheba.
\[20]And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she has also born children to your brother Nahor;
\[21]Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
\[22]And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

\[3]And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,
\[4]I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a burial plot with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
\[5]And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,
\[6]Hear us, my lord: you are a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchers bury your dead; none of us shall withhold from you his sepulcher, but that you may bury your dead.
\[7]And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.
\[8]And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
\[9]That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a burial plot among you.

\[11]No, my lord, hear me: the field give I you, and the cave that is therein, I give it you; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it you: bury your dead.
\[12]And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
\[13]And he spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if you will give it, I pray you, hear me: I will give you money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
\[14]And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
\[15]My lord, listen to me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that between me and you? bury therefore your dead.
\[16]And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
\[17]And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
\[18]To Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
\[19]And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.

nd Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
\[2]And Abraham said to his oldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh:
\[3]And I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:
\[4]But you shall go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife to my son Isaac.
\[5]And the servant said to him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land: must I needs bring your son again to the land from from where you came?
\[6]And Abraham said to him, Beware you that you bring not my son thither again.
\[7]The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spoke to me, and that swore to me, saying, To your seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife to my son from there.
\[8]And if the woman will not be willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.
\[9]And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that matter.
\[10]And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.
\[11]And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.
\[12]And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray you, send me good speed this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.
\[13]Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:
\[14]And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down your pitcher, I pray you, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give your camels drink also: let the same be she that you have appointed for your servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that you have showed kindness to my master.
\[15]And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder.
\[16]And the damsel was very fair to look on, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
\[17]And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray you, drink a little water of your pitcher.
\[18]And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him drink.
\[19]And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for your camels also, until they have done drinking.
\[20]And she hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.
\[21]And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.
\[22]And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;
\[23]And said, Whose daughter are you? tell me, I pray you: is there room in your father's house for us to lodge in?
\[24]And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bore to Nahor.
\[25]She said moreover to him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
\[26]And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.
\[27]And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who has not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brothers.
\[28]And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things.
\[29]And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out to the man, to the well.
\[30]And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets on his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me; that he came to the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.
\[31]And he said, Come in, you blessed of the LORD; why stand you without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
\[32]And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.
\[33]And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on.
\[34]And he said, I am Abraham's servant.
\[35]And the LORD has blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he has given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.
\[36]And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old: and to him has he given all that he has.
\[37]And my master made me swear, saying, You shall not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:
\[38]But you shall go to my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife to my son.
\[39]And I said to my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
\[40]And he said to me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way; and you shall take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:
\[41]Then shall you be clear from this my oath, when you come to my kindred; and if they give not you one, you shall be clear from my oath.
\[42]And I came this day to the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go:
\[43]Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin comes forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray you, a little water of your pitcher to drink;
\[44]And she say to me, Both drink you, and I will also draw for your camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD has appointed out for my master's son.
\[45]And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well, and drew water: and I said to her, Let me drink, I pray you.
\[46]And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give your camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
\[47]And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him: and I put the earring on her face, and the bracelets on her hands.
\[48]And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter to his son.
\[49]And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
\[50]Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from the LORD: we cannot speak to you bad or good.
\[51]Behold, Rebekah is before you, take her, and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as the LORD has spoken.
\[52]And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.
\[53]And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
\[54]And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.
\[55]And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.
\[56]And he said to them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD has prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.
\[57]And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.
\[58]And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Will you go with this man? And she said, I will go.
\[59]And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.
\[60]And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, You are our sister, be you the mother of thousands of millions, and let your seed possess the gate of those which hate them.
\[61]And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode on the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
\[62]And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelled in the south country.
\[63]And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.
\[64]And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.
\[65]For she had said to the servant, What man is this that walks in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a veil, and covered herself.
\[66]And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
\[67]And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

\[2]And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
\[3]And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
\[4]And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
\[5]And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.
\[6]But to the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.
\[7]And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred three score and fifteen years.
\[8]Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
\[9]And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;
\[10]The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
\[11]And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelled by the well Lahairoi.
\[12]Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham:
\[13]And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
\[14]And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
\[15]Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
\[16]These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
\[17]And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered to his people.
\[18]And they dwelled from Havilah to Shur, that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brothers.
\[19]And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:
\[20]And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
\[21]And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
\[22]And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD.
\[23]And the LORD said to her, Two nations are in your womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from your bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
\[24]And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
\[25]And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
\[26]And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was three score years old when she bore them.
\[27]And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.
\[28]And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
\[29]And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:
\[30]And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray you, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
\[31]And Jacob said, Sell me this day your birthright.
\[32]And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
\[33]And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore to him: and he sold his birthright to Jacob.
\[34]Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.

nd there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.
\[2]And the LORD appeared to him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell you of:
\[3]Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you; for to you, and to your seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham your father;
\[4]And I will make your seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give to your seed all these countries; and in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
\[5]Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
\[6]And Isaac dwelled in Gerar:
\[7]And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look on.
\[8]And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
\[9]And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is your wife; and how said you, She is my sister? And Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.
\[10]And Abimelech said, What is this you have done to us? one of the people might lightly have lien with your wife, and you should have brought guiltiness on us.
\[11]And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
\[12]Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundred times: and the LORD blessed him.
\[13]And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:
\[14]For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.
\[15]For all the wells which his father's servants had dig in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
\[16]And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us; for you are much mightier than we.
\[17]And Isaac departed there, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelled there.
\[18]And Isaac dig again the wells of water, which they had dig in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
\[19]And Isaac's servants dig in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
\[20]And the herdsmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.
\[21]And they dig another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.
\[22]And he removed from there, and dig another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
\[23]And he went up from there to Beersheba.
\[24]And the LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham your father: fear not, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your seed for my servant Abraham's sake.
\[25]And he built an altar there, and called on the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants dig a well.
\[26]Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.
\[27]And Isaac said to them, Why come you to me, seeing you hate me, and have sent me away from you?
\[28]And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with you: and we said, Let there be now an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you;
\[29]That you will do us no hurt, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace: you are now the blessed of the LORD.
\[30]And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
\[31]And they rose up betimes in the morning, and swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
\[32]And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dig, and said to him, We have found water.
\[33]And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.
\[34]And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:

nd it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his oldest son, and said to him, My son: and he said to him, Behold, here am I.
\[2]And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:
\[3]Now therefore take, I pray you, your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;
\[4]And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless you before I die.
\[5]And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
\[6]And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,
\[7]Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless you before the LORD before my death.
\[8]Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you.
\[9]Go now to the flock, and fetch me from there two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for your father, such as he loves:
\[10]And you shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, and that he may bless you before his death.
\[11]And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:
\[12]My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse on me, and not a blessing.
\[13]And his mother said to him, On me be your curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.
\[14]And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.
\[15]And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her oldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son:
\[16]And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck:
\[17]And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
\[18]And he came to his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who are you, my son?
\[19]And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau your first born; I have done according as you bade me: arise, I pray you, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.
\[20]And Isaac said to his son, How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD your God brought it to me.
\[21]And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray you, that I may feel you, my son, whether you be my very son Esau or not.
\[22]And Jacob went near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
\[23]And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.
\[24]And he said, Are you my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
\[25]And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless you. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.
\[26]And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
\[27]And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed:
\[28]Therefore God give you of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:
\[29]Let people serve you, and nations bow down to you: be lord over your brothers, and let your mother's sons bow down to you: cursed be every one that curses you, and blessed be he that blesses you.
\[30]And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
\[31]And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it to his father, and said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that your soul may bless me.
\[32]And Isaac his father said to him, Who are you? And he said, I am your son, your firstborn Esau.
\[33]And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? yes, and he shall be blessed.
\[34]And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.
\[35]And he said, Your brother came with subtlety, and has taken away your blessing.
\[36]And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?
\[37]And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now to you, my son?
\[38]And Esau said to his father, Have you but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
\[39]And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold, your dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;
\[40]And by your sword shall you live, and shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass when you shall have the dominion, that you shall break his yoke from off your neck.
\[41]And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.
\[42]And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, your brother Esau, as touching you, does comfort himself, purposing to kill you.
\[43]Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee you to Laban my brother to Haran;
\[44]And tarry with him a few days, until your brother's fury turn away;
\[45]Until your brother's anger turn away from you, and he forget that which you have done to him: then I will send, and fetch you from there: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?
\[46]And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?

\[2]Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father; and take you a wife from there of the daughers of Laban your mother's brother.
\[3]And God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a multitude of people;
\[4]And give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your seed with you; that you may inherit the land wherein you are a stranger, which God gave to Abraham.
\[5]And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
\[6]When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from there; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, You shall not take a wife of the daughers of Canaan;
\[7]And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram;
\[8]And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
\[9]Then went Esau to Ishmael, and took to the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.
\[10]And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.
\[11]And he lighted on a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.
\[12]And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
\[13]And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac: the land where on you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed;
\[14]And your seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in you and in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
\[15]And, behold, I am with you, and will keep you in all places where you go, and will bring you again into this land; for I will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken to you of.
\[16]And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.
\[17]And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
\[18]And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.
\[19]And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.
\[20]And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
\[21]So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:
\[22]And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that you shall give me I will surely give the tenth to you.

\[3]And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well's mouth in his place.
\[4]And Jacob said to them, My brothers, from where be you? And they said, Of Haran are we.
\[5]And he said to them, Know you Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.
\[6]And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter comes with the sheep.
\[7]And he said, See, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water you the sheep, and go and feed them.
\[8]And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.
\[9]And while he yet spoke with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them.
\[10]And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.

\[18]And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.
\[19]And Laban said, It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.
\[20]And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had to her.
\[21]And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.
\[22]And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
\[23]And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in to her.
\[24]And Laban gave to his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.
\[25]And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this you have done to me? did not I serve with you for Rachel? why then have you beguiled me?
\[26]And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
\[27]Fulfill her week, and we will give you this also for the service which you shall serve with me yet seven other years.
\[28]And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.
\[29]And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.
\[30]And he went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.

\[26]Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, and let me go: for you know my service which I have done you.
\[27]And Laban said to him, I pray you, if I have found favor in your eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD has blessed me for your sake.
\[28]And he said, Appoint me your wages, and I will give it.
\[29]And he said to him, You know how I have served you, and how your cattle was with me.
\[30]For it was little which you had before I came, and it is now increased to a multitude; and the LORD has blessed you since my coming: and now when shall I provide for my own house also?

\[32]I will pass through all your flock to day, removing from there all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.
\[33]So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before your face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.
\[34]And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to your word.
\[35]And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.
\[36]And he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
\[37]And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
\[38]And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.
\[39]And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.
\[40]And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not to Laban's cattle.
\[41]And it came to pass, whenever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
\[42]But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
\[43]And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

nd he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's has he gotten all this glory.
\[2]And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.
\[3]And the LORD said to Jacob, Return to the land of your fathers, and to your kindred; and I will be with you.
\[4]And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,
\[5]And said to them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.
\[6]And you know that with all my power I have served your father.
\[7]And your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.
\[8]If he said thus, The speckled shall be your wages; then all the cattle bore speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be your hire; then bore all the cattle ringstraked.
\[9]Thus God has taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
\[10]And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped on the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.
\[11]And the angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.
\[12]And he said, Lift up now your eyes, and see, all the rams which leap on the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and spotted: for I have seen all that Laban does to you.
\[13]I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar, and where you vowed a vow to me: now arise, get you out from this land, and return to the land of your kindred.
\[14]And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
\[15]Are we not counted of him strangers? for he has sold us, and has quite devoured also our money.
\[16]For all the riches which God has taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatever God has said to you, do.
\[17]Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on camels;
\[18]And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.
\[19]And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.
\[20]And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.
\[21]So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.
\[22]And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
\[23]And he took his brothers with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.
\[24]And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said to him, Take heed that you speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
\[25]Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brothers pitched in the mount of Gilead.
\[26]And Laban said to Jacob, What have you done, that you have stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?
\[27]Why did you flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and did not tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
\[28]And have not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? you have now done foolishly in so doing.
\[29]It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Take you heed that you speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
\[30]And now, though you would needs be gone, because you sore longed after your father's house, yet why have you stolen my gods?
\[31]And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure you would take by force your daughters from me.
\[32]With whomsoever you find your gods, let him not live: before our brothers discern you what is your with me, and take it to you. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
\[33]And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
\[34]Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat on them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.
\[35]And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before you; for the custom of women is on me. And he searched but found not the images.
\[36]And Jacob was wroth, and strived with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that you have so hotly pursued after me?
\[37]Whereas you have searched all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? set it here before my brothers and your brothers, that they may judge between us both.
\[38]This twenty years have I been with you; your ewes and your she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of your flock have I not eaten.
\[39]That which was torn of beasts I brought not to you; I bore the loss of it; of my hand did you require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.
\[40]Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from my eyes.
\[41]Thus have I been twenty years in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your cattle: and you have changed my wages ten times.
\[42]Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely you had sent me away now empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.
\[43]And Laban answered and said to Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children which they have born?
\[44]Now therefore come you, let us make a covenant, I and you; and let it be for a witness between me and you.
\[45]And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
\[46]And Jacob said to his brothers, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there on the heap.
\[47]And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
\[48]And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and you this day.  Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;
\[49]And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.
\[50]If you shall afflict my daughters, or if you shall take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness between me and you.
\[51]And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast between me and you:
\[52]This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you shall not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
\[53]The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.
\[54]Then Jacob offered sacrifice on the mount, and called his brothers to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.
\[55]And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned to his place.

\[2]And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
\[3]And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
\[4]And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall you speak to my lord Esau; Your servant Jacob said thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:
\[5]And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in your sight.
\[6]And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and also he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him.
\[7]Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;
\[8]And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.
\[9]And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which said to me, Return to your country, and to your kindred, and I will deal well with you:
\[10]I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which you have showed to your servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.
\[11]Deliver me, I pray you, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.
\[12]And you said, I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
\[13]And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;
\[14]Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,
\[15]Thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.
\[16]And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space between drove and drove.
\[17]And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets you, and asks you, saying, Whose are you? and where go you? and whose are these before you?
\[18]Then you shall say, They be your servant Jacob's; it is a present sent to my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.
\[19]And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall you speak to Esau, when you find him.
\[20]And say you moreover, Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.
\[21]So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
\[22]And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.
\[23]And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.
\[24]And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
\[25]And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
\[26]And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let you go, except you bless me.
\[27]And he said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.
\[28]And he said, Your name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince have you power with God and with men, and have prevailed.
\[29]And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray you, your name. And he said, Why is it that you do ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
\[30]And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
\[31]And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose on him, and he halted on his thigh.
\[32]Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.

\[2]And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph last.
\[3]And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
\[4]And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
\[5]And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with you? And he said, The children which God has graciously given your servant.
\[6]Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
\[7]And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
\[8]And he said, What mean you by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.
\[9]And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that you have to yourself.
\[10]And Jacob said, No, I pray you, if now I have found grace in your sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen your face, as though I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me.
\[11]Take, I pray you, my blessing that is brought to you; because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.
\[12]And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you.
\[13]And he said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.
\[14]Let my lord, I pray you, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goes before me and the children be able to endure, until I come to my lord to Seir.
\[15]And Esau said, Let me now leave with you some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needs it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.
\[16]So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
\[17]And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.

\[2]And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.
\[3]And his soul joined to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke kindly to the damsel.
\[4]And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
\[5]And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.
\[6]And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to commune with him.
\[7]And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had worked folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done.
\[8]And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.
\[9]And make you marriages with us, and give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to you.
\[10]And you shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade you therein, and get you possessions therein.
\[11]And Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what you shall say to me I will give.
\[12]Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as you shall say to me: but give me the damsel to wife.
\[13]And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:
\[14]And they said to them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach to us:
\[15]But in this will we consent to you: If you will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;
\[16]Then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
\[17]But if you will not listen to us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
\[18]And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.
\[19]And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honorable than all the house of his father.
\[20]And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
\[21]These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
\[22]Only herein will the men consent to us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
\[23]Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of their's be our's? only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.
\[24]And to Hamor and to Shechem his son listened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
\[25]And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took each man his sword, and came on the city boldly, and slew all the males.

\[28]They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,
\[29]And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.
\[30]And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.

\[3]And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.

\[5]And they journeyed: and the terror of God was on the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
\[6]So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.

\[12]And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to you I will give it, and to your seed after you will I give the land.

\[21]And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.

\[3]Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.
\[4]And when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.
\[5]And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brothers: and they hated him yet the more.
\[6]And he said to them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
\[7]For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, see, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.
\[8]And his brothers said to him, Shall you indeed reign over us? or shall you indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
\[9]And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brothers, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.
\[10]And he told it to his father, and to his brothers: and his father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream that you have dreamed?  Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down ourselves to you to the earth?
\[11]And his brothers envied him; but his father observed the saying.
\[12]And his brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
\[13]And Israel said to Joseph, Do not your brothers feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send you to them. And he said to him, Here am I.
\[14]And he said to him, Go, I pray you, see whether it be well with your brothers, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
\[15]And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seek you?
\[16]And he said, I seek my brothers: tell me, I pray you, where they feed their flocks.
\[17]And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.
\[18]And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near to them, they conspired against him to slay him.
\[19]And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer comes.
\[20]Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast has devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
\[21]And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.
\[22]And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand on him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.
\[23]And it came to pass, when Joseph was come to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him;
\[24]And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.
\[25]And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
\[26]And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?
\[27]Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be on him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brothers were content.
\[28]Then there passed by Midianites merchants; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
\[29]And Reuben returned to the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
\[30]And he returned to his brothers, and said, The child is not; and I, where shall I go?
\[31]And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;
\[32]And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be your son's coat or no.
\[33]And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
\[34]And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
\[35]And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave to my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.
\[36]And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

nd it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brothers, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
\[2]And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in to her.
\[3]And she conceived, and bore a son; and he called his name Er.
\[4]And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she called his name Onan.
\[5]And she yet again conceived, and bore a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.
\[6]And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.
\[7]And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.
\[8]And Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to your brother.
\[9]And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.
\[10]And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: why he slew him also.
\[11]Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at your father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brothers did. And Tamar went and dwelled in her father's house.
\[12]And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
\[13]And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold your father in law goes up to Timnath to shear his sheep.
\[14]And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him to wife.
\[15]When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.
\[16]And he turned to her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray you, let me come in to you; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What will you give me, that you may come in to me?
\[17]And he said, I will send you a kid from the flock. And she said, Will you give me a pledge, till you send it?
\[18]And he said, What pledge shall I give you? And she said, Your signet, and your bracelets, and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave it her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.
\[19]And she arose, and went away, and laid by her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
\[20]And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.
\[21]Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.
\[22]And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.
\[23]And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and you have not found her.
\[24]And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar your daughter in law has played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by prostitution. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
\[25]When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray you, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
\[26]And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She has been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.
\[27]And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.
\[28]And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound on his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
\[29]And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How have you broken forth? this breach be on you: therefore his name was called Pharez.
\[30]And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread on his hand: and his name was called Zarah.

nd Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.
\[2]And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
\[3]And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
\[4]And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
\[5]And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in the house, and in the field.
\[6]And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favored.
\[7]And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.
\[8]But he refused, and said to his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he has committed all that he has to my hand;
\[9]There is none greater in this house than I; neither has he kept back any thing from me but you, because you are his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
\[10]And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he listened not to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.
\[11]And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.
\[12]And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.
\[13]And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,
\[14]That she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he has brought in an Hebrew to us to mock us; he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
\[15]And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.
\[16]And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.
\[17]And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me:
\[18]And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.
\[19]And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, After this manner did your servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
\[20]And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.
\[21]But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
\[22]And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatever they did there, he was the doer of it.
\[23]The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.

nd it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
\[2]And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
\[3]And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
\[4]And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.
\[5]And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.
\[6]And Joseph came in to them in the morning, and looked on them, and, behold, they were sad.
\[7]And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Why look you so sadly to day?
\[8]And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.
\[9]And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;
\[10]And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:
\[11]And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
\[12]And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:
\[13]Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up your head, and restore you to your place: and you shall deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when you were his butler.
\[14]But think on me when it shall be well with you, and show kindness, I pray you, to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:
\[15]For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
\[16]When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:
\[17]And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket on my head.
\[18]And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:
\[19]Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up your head from off you, and shall hang you on a tree; and the birds shall eat your flesh from off you.
\[20]And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast to all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
\[21]And he restored the chief butler to his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
\[22]But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.

nd it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
\[2]And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favored cows and fat; and they fed in a meadow.
\[3]And, behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill favored and skinney; and stood by the other cows on the brink of the river.
\[4]And the ill favored and skinney cows did eat up the seven well favored and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.
\[5]And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up on one stalk, rank and good.
\[6]And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
\[7]And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
\[8]And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them to Pharaoh.
\[9]Then spoke the chief butler to Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
\[10]Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:
\[11]And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
\[12]And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
\[13]And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored to my office, and him he hanged.
\[14]Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in to Pharaoh.
\[15]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of you, that you can understand a dream to interpret it.
\[16]And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
\[17]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood on the bank of the river:
\[18]And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fat and well favored; and they fed in a meadow:
\[19]And, behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ill favored and skinney, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
\[20]And the lean and the ill favored cows did eat up the first seven fat cows:
\[21]And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
\[22]And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:
\[23]And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
\[24]And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this to the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.
\[25]And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God has showed Pharaoh what he is about to do.
\[26]The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
\[27]And the seven thin and ill favored cows that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
\[28]This is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh: What God is about to do he shows to Pharaoh.
\[29]Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
\[30]And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
\[31]And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.
\[32]And for that the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
\[33]Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
\[34]Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
\[35]And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.
\[36]And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
\[37]And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
\[38]And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?
\[39]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, For as much as God has showed you all this, there is none so discreet and wise as you are:
\[40]You shall be over my house, and according to your word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than you.
\[41]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.
\[42]And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in clothing of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
\[43]And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.
\[44]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without you shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
\[45]And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.
\[46]And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[47]And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
\[48]And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.
\[49]And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.
\[50]And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bore to him.
\[51]And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
\[52]And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
\[53]And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
\[54]And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
\[55]And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he said to you, do.
\[56]And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
\[57]And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.

\[2]And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from there; that we may live, and not die.
\[3]And Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy corn in Egypt.
\[4]But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brothers; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.
\[5]And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
\[6]And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brothers came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.
\[7]And Joseph saw his brothers, and he knew them, but made himself strange to them, and spoke roughly to them; and he said to them, From where come you? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
\[8]And Joseph knew his brothers, but they knew not him.
\[9]And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said to them, You are spies; to see the nakedness of the land you are come.
\[10]And they said to him, No, my lord, but to buy food are your servants come.
\[11]We are all one man's sons; we are true men, your servants are no spies.
\[12]And he said to them, No, but to see the nakedness of the land you are come.
\[13]And they said, Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
\[14]And Joseph said to them, That is it that I spoke to you, saying, You are spies:
\[15]Hereby you shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh you shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come here.
\[16]Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and you shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.
\[17]And he put them all together into ward three days.
\[18]And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:
\[19]If you be true men, let one of your brothers be bound in the house of your prison: go you, carry corn for the famine of your houses:
\[20]But bring your youngest brother to me; so shall your words be verified, and you shall not die. And they did so.
\[21]And they said one to another, We are truly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he sought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come on us.
\[22]And Reuben answered them, saying, Spoke I not to you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and you would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.
\[23]And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spoke to them by an interpreter.
\[24]And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.
\[25]Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he to them.
\[26]And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed there.
\[27]And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.
\[28]And he said to his brothers, My money is restored; and, see, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God has done to us?
\[29]And they came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell to them; saying,
\[30]The man, who is the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.
\[31]And we said to him, We are true men; we are no spies:
\[32]We be twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
\[33]And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, Hereby shall I know that you are true men; leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:
\[34]And bring your youngest brother to me: then shall I know that you are no spies, but that you are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and you shall traffic in the land.
\[35]And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
\[36]And Jacob their father said to them, Me have you bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and you will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.
\[37]And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to you: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to you again.
\[38]And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which you go, then shall you bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

\[4]If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food:
\[5]But if you will not send him, we will not go down: for the man said to us, You shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.

\[7]And they said, The man asked us straightly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have you another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
\[8]And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.
\[9]I will be surety for him; of my hand shall you require him: if I bring him not to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame for ever:
\[10]For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.
\[11]And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:
\[12]And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:
\[13]Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man:
\[14]And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.
\[15]And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
\[16]And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.
\[17]And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
\[18]And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall on us, and take us for slaves, and our asses.
\[19]And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,
\[20]And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:
\[21]And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
\[22]And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
\[23]And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out to them.
\[24]And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.
\[25]And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
\[26]And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
\[27]And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?
\[28]And they answered, Your servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.
\[29]And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom you spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to you, my son.
\[30]And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn on his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.
\[31]And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
\[32]And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.
\[33]And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marveled one at another.
\[34]And he took and sent messes to them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And they drank, and were merry with him.

\[2]And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
\[3]As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
\[4]And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when you do overtake them, say to them, Why have you rewarded evil for good?
\[5]Is not this it in which my lord drinks, and whereby indeed he divines? you have done evil in so doing.
\[6]And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words.
\[7]And they said to him, Why said my lord these words? God forbid that your servants should do according to this thing:
\[8]Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of your lord's house silver or gold?
\[9]With whomsoever of your servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's slaves.
\[10]And he said, Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and you shall be blameless.
\[11]Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
\[12]And he searched, and began at the oldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
\[13]Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
\[14]And Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
\[15]And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that you have done? know you not that such a man as I can certainly divine?
\[16]And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak?  or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.
\[17]And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace to your father.
\[18]Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh my lord, let your servant, I pray you, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant: for you are even as Pharaoh.
\[19]My lord asked his servants, saying, Have you a father, or a brother?
\[20]And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.
\[21]And you said to your servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.
\[22]And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.
\[23]And you said to your servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, you shall see my face no more.
\[24]And it came to pass when we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
\[25]And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.
\[26]And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.
\[27]And your servant my father said to us, You know that my wife bore me two sons:
\[28]And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:
\[29]And if you take this also from me, and mischief befall him, you shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
\[30]Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;
\[31]It shall come to pass, when he sees that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and your servants shall bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave.
\[32]For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to you, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.
\[33]Now therefore, I pray you, let your servant abide instead of the lad a slave to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brothers.
\[34]For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.

\[2]And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
\[3]And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph; does my father yet live? And his brothers could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
\[4]And Joseph said to his brothers, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.
\[5]Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
\[6]For these two years has the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be ripening nor harvest.
\[7]And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
\[8]So now it was not you that sent me here, but God: and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[9]Haste you, and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus said your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt: come down to me, tarry not:
\[10]And you shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near to me, you, and your children, and your children's children, and your flocks, and your herds, and all that you have:
\[11]And there will I nourish you; for yet there are five years of famine; lest you, and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty.
\[12]And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.
\[13]And you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen; and you shall haste and bring down my father here.
\[14]And he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept on his neck.
\[15]Moreover he kissed all his brothers, and wept on them: and after that his brothers talked with him.
\[16]And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brothers are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
\[17]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your brothers, This do you; lade your beasts, and go, get you to the land of Canaan;
\[18]And take your father and your households, and come to me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.
\[19]Now you are commanded, this do you; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
\[20]Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is your's.
\[21]And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
\[22]To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.
\[23]And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.
\[24]So he sent his brothers away, and they departed: and he said to them, See that you fall not out by the way.
\[25]And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father,
\[26]And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.
\[27]And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:
\[28]And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.

\[3]And he said, I am God, the God of your father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of you a great nation:
\[4]I will go down with you into Egypt; and I will also surely bring you up again: and Joseph shall put his hand on your eyes.
\[5]And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
\[6]And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:
\[7]His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
\[8]And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.
\[9]And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.
\[10]And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.
\[11]And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

\[14]And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.

\[16]And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
\[17]And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.

\[19]The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.
\[20]And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bore to him.
\[21]And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.

\[26]All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were three score and six;

\[29]And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself to him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
\[30]And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen your face, because you are yet alive.
\[31]And Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father's house, I will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say to him, My brothers, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come to me;
\[32]And the men are shepherds, for their trade has been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
\[33]And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?
\[34]That you shall say, Your servants' trade has been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.

\[2]And he took some of his brothers, even five men, and presented them to Pharaoh.
\[3]And Pharaoh said to his brothers, What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Your servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.
\[4]They said morever to Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for your servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray you, let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
\[5]And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Your father and your brothers are come to you:
\[6]The land of Egypt is before you; in the best of the land make your father and brothers to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if you know any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
\[7]And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
\[8]And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How old are you?
\[9]And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
\[10]And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
\[11]And Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
\[12]And Joseph nourished his father, and his brothers, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.
\[13]And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
\[14]And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
\[15]And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in your presence? for the money fails.
\[16]And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.
\[17]And they brought their cattle to Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.
\[18]When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also has our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:
\[19]Why shall we die before your eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.
\[20]And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.
\[21]And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.
\[22]Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: why they sold not their lands.
\[23]Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: see, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.
\[24]And it shall come to pass in the increase, that you shall give the fifth part to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.
\[25]And they said, You have saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.
\[26]And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.
\[27]And Israel dwelled in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.
\[28]And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.
\[29]And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found grace in your sight, put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray you, in Egypt:
\[30]But I will lie with my fathers, and you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burial plot. And he said, I will do as you have said.

\[2]And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, your son Joseph comes to you: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed.
\[3]And Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
\[4]And said to me, Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a multitude of people; and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession.
\[5]And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
\[6]And your issue, which you beget after them, shall be yours, and shall be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.
\[7]And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.
\[8]And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?
\[9]And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray you, to me, and I will bless them.
\[10]Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see.  And he brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
\[11]And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see your face: and, see, God has showed me also your seed.
\[12]And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
\[13]And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him.
\[14]And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.
\[15]And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long to this day,
\[16]The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the middle of the earth.
\[17]And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
\[18]And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.
\[19]And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
\[20]And he blessed them that day, saying, In you shall Israel bless, saying, God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
\[21]And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.

\[32]The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.

nd Joseph fell on his father's face, and wept on him, and kissed him.
\[2]And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
\[3]And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him three score and ten days.
\[4]And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
\[5]My father made me swear, saying, See, I die: in my grave which I have dig for me in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray you, and bury my father, and I will come again.
\[6]And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury your father, according as he made you swear.
\[7]And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
\[8]And all the house of Joseph, and his brothers, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
\[9]And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
\[10]And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
\[11]And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: why the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.
\[12]And his sons did to him according as he commanded them:
\[13]For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burial plot of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
\[14]And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
\[15]And when Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did to him.
\[16]And they sent a messenger to Joseph, saying, Your father did command before he died, saying,
\[17]So shall you say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray you now, the trespass of your brothers, and their sin; for they did to you evil: and now, we pray you, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of your father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
\[18]And his brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be your servants.
\[19]And Joseph said to them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
\[20]But as for you, you thought evil against me; but God meant it to good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
\[21]Now therefore fear you not: I will nourish you, and your little ones.  And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.
\[22]And Joseph dwelled in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.
\[23]And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up on Joseph's knees.
\[24]And Joseph said to his brothers, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
\[25]And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from hence.
\[26]So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

ow these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
\[2]Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
\[3]Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
\[4]Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
\[5]And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.
\[6]And Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.
\[7]And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
\[8]Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.
\[9]And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:
\[10]Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falls out any war, they join also to our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.
\[11]Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.
\[12]But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.  And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
\[13]And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor:
\[14]And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigor.
\[15]And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:
\[16]And he said, When you do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the stools; if it be a son, then you shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.
\[17]But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.
\[18]And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, Why have you done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?
\[19]And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in to them.
\[20]Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.
\[21]And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.
\[22]And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.

nd there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.
\[2]And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.
\[3]And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.
\[4]And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
\[5]And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.
\[6]And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.
\[7]Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to you a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?
\[8]And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.
\[9]And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it.
\[10]And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.
\[11]And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brothers, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brothers.
\[12]And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
\[13]And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Why smite you your fellow?
\[14]And he said, Who made you a prince and a judge over us? intend you to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.
\[15]Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelled in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.
\[16]Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
\[17]And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
\[18]And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you are come so soon to day?
\[19]And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.
\[20]And he said to his daughters, And where is he? why is it that you have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.
\[21]And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
\[22]And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.
\[23]And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God by reason of the bondage.
\[24]And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
\[25]And God looked on the children of Israel, and God had respect to them.

ow Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.
\[2]And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
\[3]And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
\[4]And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the middle of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.
\[5]And he said, Draw not near here: put off your shoes from off your feet, for the place where on you stand is holy ground.
\[6]Moreover he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look on God.
\[7]And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;
\[8]And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good land and a large, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
\[9]Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come to me: and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.
\[10]Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
\[11]And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
\[12]And he said, Certainly I will be with you; and this shall be a token to you, that I have sent you: When you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.
\[13]And Moses said to God, Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and shall say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say to them?
\[14]And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.
\[15]And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial to all generations.
\[16]Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:
\[17]And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.
\[18]And they shall listen to your voice: and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has met with us: and now let us go, we beseech you, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
\[19]And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.
\[20]And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the middle thereof: and after that he will let you go.
\[21]And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when you go, you shall not go empty.
\[22]But every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that sojournes in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and you shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters; and you shall spoil the Egyptians.

\[2]And the LORD said to him, What is that in your hand? And he said, A rod.
\[3]And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.
\[4]And the LORD said to Moses, Put forth your hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:
\[5]That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.
\[6]And the LORD said furthermore to him, Put now your hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.
\[7]And he said, Put your hand into your bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.
\[8]And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe you, neither listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.
\[9]And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither listen to your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land: and the water which you take out of the river shall become blood on the dry land.
\[10]And Moses said to the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since you have spoken to your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.
\[11]And the LORD said to him, Who has made man's mouth? or who makes the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?
\[12]Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall say.
\[13]And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray you, by the hand of him whom you will send.
\[14]And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he comes forth to meet you: and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
\[15]And you shall speak to him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.
\[16]And he shall be your spokesman to the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to you instead of a mouth, and you shall be to him instead of God.
\[17]And you shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do signs.
\[18]And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray you, and return to my brothers which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.
\[19]And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought your life.
\[20]And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
\[21]And the LORD said to Moses, When you go to return into Egypt, see that you do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in your hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.
\[22]And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus said the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:
\[23]And I say to you, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay your son, even your firstborn.
\[24]And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.
\[25]Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband are you to me.
\[26]So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband you are, because of the circumcision.
\[27]And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.
\[28]And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.
\[29]And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:
\[30]And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.

\[2]And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.
\[3]And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us: let us go, we pray you, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice to the LORD our God; lest he fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword.
\[4]And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do you, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you to your burdens.
\[5]And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and you make them rest from their burdens.
\[6]And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,
\[7]You shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.
\[8]And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, you shall lay on them; you shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.
\[9]Let there more work be laid on the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard vain words.
\[10]And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus said Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.
\[11]Go you, get you straw where you can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.
\[12]So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.
\[13]And the taskmasters hurried them, saying, Fulfill your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.
\[14]And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Why have you not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?
\[15]Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why deal you thus with your servants?
\[16]There is no straw given to your servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.
\[17]But he said, You are idle, you are idle: therefore you say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.
\[18]Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall you deliver the tale of bricks.
\[19]And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, You shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.
\[20]And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:
\[21]And they said to them, The LORD look on you, and judge; because you have made our smell to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.
\[22]And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, LORD, why have you so evil entreated this people? why is it that you have sent me?
\[23]For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people; neither have you delivered your people at all.

\[3]And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.
\[4]And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.

\[10]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[11]Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
\[12]And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not listened to me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?

\[5]And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth my hand on Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.
\[6]And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.
\[7]And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
\[8]And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
\[9]When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Show a miracle for you: then you shall say to Aaron, Take your rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.
\[10]And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
\[11]Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.
\[12]For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
\[13]And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he listened not to them; as the LORD had said.
\[14]And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuses to let the people go.
\[15]Get you to Pharaoh in the morning; see, he goes out to the water; and you shall stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shall you take in your hand.
\[16]And you shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, till now you would not hear.
\[17]Thus said the LORD, In this you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.
\[18]And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water of the river.
\[19]And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out your hand on the waters of Egypt, on their streams, on their rivers, and on their ponds, and on all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.
\[20]And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.
\[21]And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[22]And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he listen to them; as the LORD had said.
\[23]And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.
\[24]And all the Egyptians dig round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.
\[25]And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.

nd the LORD spoke to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus said the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[2]And if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all your borders with frogs:
\[3]And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your bedchamber, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs:
\[4]And the frogs shall come up both on you, and on your people, and on all your servants.
\[5]And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth your hand with your rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.
\[6]And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
\[7]And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.
\[8]Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice to the LORD.
\[9]And Moses said to Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I entreat for you, and for your servants, and for your people, to destroy the frogs from you and your houses, that they may remain in the river only?
\[10]And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to your word: that you may know that there is none like to the LORD our God.
\[11]And the frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people; they shall remain in the river only.
\[12]And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried to the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.
\[13]And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.
\[14]And they gathered them together on heaps: and the land stank.
\[15]But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and listened not to them; as the LORD had said.
\[16]And the LORD said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out your rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[17]And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[18]And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice on man, and on beast.
\[19]Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had said.
\[20]And the LORD said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; see, he comes forth to the water; and say to him, Thus said the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[21]Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground where on they are.
\[22]And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end you may know that I am the LORD in the middle of the earth.
\[23]And I will put a division between my people and your people: to morrow shall this sign be.
\[24]And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.
\[25]And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go you, sacrifice to your God in the land.
\[26]And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: see, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?
\[27]We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.
\[28]And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away: entreat for me.
\[29]And Moses said, Behold, I go out from you, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.
\[30]And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.
\[31]And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.

\[2]For if you refuse to let them go, and will hold them still,
\[3]Behold, the hand of the LORD is on your cattle which is in the field, on the horses, on the asses, on the camels, on the oxen, and on the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.
\[4]And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel.
\[5]And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.
\[6]And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.
\[7]And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
\[8]And the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.
\[9]And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains on man, and on beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[10]And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains on man, and on beast.
\[11]And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was on the magicians, and on all the Egyptians.
\[12]And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had spoken to Moses.
\[13]And the LORD said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus said the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[14]For I will at this time send all my plagues on your heart, and on your servants, and on your people; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.
\[15]For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite you and your people with pestilence; and you shall be cut off from the earth.
\[16]And in very deed for this cause have I raised you up, for to show in you my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.
\[17]As yet exalt you yourself against my people, that you will not let them go?
\[18]Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.
\[19]Send therefore now, and gather your cattle, and all that you have in the field; for on every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down on them, and they shall die.
\[20]He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:
\[21]And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.
\[22]And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch forth your hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man, and on beast, and on every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.
\[23]And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along on the ground; and the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt.
\[24]So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
\[25]And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.
\[26]Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.
\[27]And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.
\[28]Entreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunder and hail; and I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.
\[29]And Moses said to him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that you may know how that the earth is the LORD's.
\[30]But as for you and your servants, I know that you will not yet fear the LORD God.
\[31]And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.
\[32]But the wheat and the rye were not smitten: for they were not grown up.
\[33]And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.
\[34]And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
\[35]And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.

\[2]And that you may tell in the ears of your son, and of your son's son, what things I have worked in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that you may know how that I am the LORD.
\[3]And Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus said the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[4]Else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into your coast:
\[5]And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field:
\[6]And they shall fill your houses, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither your fathers, nor your fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.
\[7]And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: know you not yet that Egypt is destroyed?
\[8]And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh: and he said to them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?
\[9]And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to the LORD.
\[10]And he said to them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.
\[11]Not so: go now you that are men, and serve the LORD; for that you did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
\[12]And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left.
\[13]And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind on the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
\[14]And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.
\[15]For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
\[16]Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.
\[17]Now therefore forgive, I pray you, my sin only this once, and entreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.
\[18]And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.
\[19]And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.
\[20]But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.
\[21]And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.
\[22]And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:
\[23]They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
\[24]And Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, Go you, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.
\[25]And Moses said, You must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
\[26]Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.
\[27]But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.
\[28]And Pharaoh said to him, Get you from me, take heed to yourself, see my face no more; for in that day you see my face you shall die.

\[3]Speak you to all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:
\[4]And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next to his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.
\[5]Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: you shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:
\[6]And you shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.
\[7]And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.
\[8]And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.
\[9]Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the entrails thereof.
\[10]And you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire.
\[11]And thus shall you eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD's passover.
\[12]For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.
\[13]And the blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.
\[14]And this day shall be to you for a memorial; and you shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.
\[15]Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
\[16]And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.
\[17]And you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall you observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.
\[18]In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.
\[19]Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whoever eats that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.
\[20]You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall you eat unleavened bread.
\[21]Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.
\[22]And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.
\[23]For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.
\[24]And you shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons for ever.
\[25]And it shall come to pass, when you be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he has promised, that you shall keep this service.

\[27]That you shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.
\[28]And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
\[29]And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.
\[30]And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.
\[31]And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as you have said.
\[32]Also take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also.
\[33]And the Egyptians were urgent on the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.
\[34]And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.
\[35]And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:
\[36]And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent to them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.
\[37]And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.
\[38]And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.
\[39]And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.
\[40]Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelled in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.
\[41]And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.
\[42]It is a night to be much observed to the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.
\[43]And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:
\[44]But every man's servant that is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.
\[45]A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.
\[46]In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall you break a bone thereof.
\[47]All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
\[48]And when a stranger shall sojourn with you, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.
\[49]One law shall be to him that is home born, and to the stranger that sojournes among you.

\[4]This day came you out in the month Abib.
\[5]And it shall be when the LORD shall bring you into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month.
\[6]Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD.
\[7]Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with you, neither shall there be leaven seen with you in all your quarters.
\[8]And you shall show your son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did to me when I came forth out of Egypt.
\[9]And it shall be for a sign to you on your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that the LORD's law may be in your mouth: for with a strong hand has the LORD brought you out of Egypt.
\[10]You shall therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.
\[11]And it shall be when the LORD shall bring you into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and shall give it you,
\[12]That you shall set apart to the LORD all that opens the matrix, and every firstling that comes of a beast which you have; the males shall be the LORD's.
\[13]And every firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among your children shall you redeem.
\[14]And it shall be when your son asks you in time to come, saying, What is this? that you shall say to him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:
\[15]And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that opens the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.
\[16]And it shall be for a token on your hand, and for frontlets between your eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.
\[17]And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:
\[18]But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.
\[19]And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straightly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and you shall carry up my bones away hence with you.
\[20]And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
\[21]And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:
\[22]He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.

\[7]And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

\[11]And they said to Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? why have you dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?
\[12]Is not this the word that we did tell you in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.
\[13]And Moses said to the people, Fear you not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will show to you to day: for the Egyptians whom you have seen to day, you shall see them again no more for ever.
\[14]The LORD shall fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.
\[15]And the LORD said to Moses, Why cry you to me? speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward:
\[16]But lift you up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the middle of the sea.
\[17]And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honor on Pharaoh, and on all his host, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.
\[18]And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honor on Pharaoh, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.
\[19]And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:
\[20]And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.
\[21]And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
\[22]And the children of Israel went into the middle of the sea on the dry ground: and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.
\[23]And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the middle of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
\[24]And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked to the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,
\[25]And took off their chariot wheels, that they drove them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.
\[26]And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.
\[27]And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the middle of the sea.
\[28]And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.
\[29]But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the middle of the sea; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.
\[30]Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the sea shore.
\[31]And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did on the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.

hen sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.
\[2]The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.
\[3]The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.
\[4]Pharaoh's chariots and his host has he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.
\[5]The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.
\[6]Your right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: your right hand, O LORD, has dashed in pieces the enemy.
\[7]And in the greatness of your excellency you have overthrown them that rose up against you: you sent forth your wrath, which consumed them as stubble.
\[8]And with the blast of your nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.
\[9]The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied on them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
\[10]You did blow with your wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.
\[11]Who is like to you, O LORD, among the gods? who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?
\[12]You stretched out your right hand, the earth swallowed them.
\[13]You in your mercy have led forth the people which you have redeemed: you have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.
\[14]The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.
\[15]Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold on them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.
\[16]Fear and dread shall fall on them; by the greatness of your arm they shall be as still as a stone; till your people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which you have purchased.
\[17]You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which you have made for you to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which your hands have established.
\[18]The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.
\[19]For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea on them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the middle of the sea.
\[20]And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.
\[21]And Miriam answered them, Sing you to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.
\[22]So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
\[23]And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.
\[24]And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
\[25]And he cried to the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,
\[26]And said, If you will diligently listen to the voice of the LORD your God, and will do that which is right in his sight, and will give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases on you, which I have brought on the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that heals you.
\[27]And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and three score and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.

nd they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
\[2]And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:
\[3]And the children of Israel said to them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for you have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
\[4]Then said the LORD to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.
\[5]And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
\[6]And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, At even, then you shall know that the LORD has brought you out from the land of Egypt:
\[7]And in the morning, then you shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he hears your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that you murmur against us?
\[8]And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD hears your murmurings which you murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.
\[9]And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he has heard your murmurings.
\[10]And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
\[11]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[12]I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak to them, saying, At even you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God.
\[13]And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.
\[14]And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, on the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.
\[15]And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they knew not what it was. And Moses said to them, This is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.
\[16]This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take you every man for them which are in his tents.
\[17]And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.
\[18]And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.
\[19]And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
\[20]Notwithstanding they listened not to Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.
\[21]And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
\[22]And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
\[23]And he said to them, This is that which the LORD has said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath to the LORD: bake that which you will bake to day, and seethe that you will seethe; and that which remains over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
\[24]And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.
\[25]And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath to the LORD: to day you shall not find it in the field.
\[26]Six days you shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.
\[27]And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.
\[28]And the LORD said to Moses, How long refuse you to keep my commandments and my laws?
\[29]See, for that the LORD has given you the sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide you every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
\[30]So the people rested on the seventh day.
\[31]And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.
\[32]And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commands, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread with which I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.
\[33]And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.
\[34]As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
\[35]And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.
\[36]Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

\[2]Why the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why chide you with me? why do you tempt the LORD?
\[3]And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why is this that you have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?
\[4]And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, What shall I do to this people? they be almost ready to stone me.
\[5]And the LORD said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take with you of the elders of Israel; and your rod, with which you smote the river, take in your hand, and go.
\[6]Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb; and you shall smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
\[7]And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?
\[8]Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
\[9]And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.
\[10]So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
\[11]And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
\[12]But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
\[13]And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
\[14]And the LORD said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
\[15]And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:
\[16]For he said, Because the LORD has sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

hen Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;
\[2]Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,
\[3]And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:
\[4]And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:
\[5]And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:
\[6]And he said to Moses, I your father in law Jethro am come to you, and your wife, and her two sons with her.
\[7]And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.
\[8]And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come on them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.
\[9]And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.
\[10]And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
\[11]Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.
\[12]And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.
\[13]And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening.
\[14]And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that you do to the people? why sit you yourself alone, and all the people stand by you from morning to even?
\[15]And Moses said to his father in law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God:
\[16]When they have a matter, they come to me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.
\[17]And Moses' father in law said to him, The thing that you do is not good.
\[18]You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you: for this thing is too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it yourself alone.
\[19]Listen now to my voice, I will give you counsel, and God shall be with you: Be you for the people to God-ward, that you may bring the causes to God:
\[20]And you shall teach them ordinances and laws, and shall show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.
\[21]Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:
\[22]And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for yourself, and they shall bear the burden with you.
\[23]If you shall do this thing, and God command you so, then you shall be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.
\[24]So Moses listened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.
\[25]And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
\[26]And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
\[27]And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.

\[2]For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.
\[3]And Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;
\[4]You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.
\[5]Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:
\[6]And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.  These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.
\[7]And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.
\[8]And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD has spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people to the LORD.
\[9]And the LORD said to Moses, See, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you for ever.  And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.
\[10]And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,
\[11]And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people on mount Sinai.
\[12]And you shall set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that you go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whoever touches the mount shall be surely put to death:
\[13]There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mount.
\[14]And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.
\[15]And he said to the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.
\[16]And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightning, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.
\[17]And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
\[18]And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.
\[19]And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.
\[20]And the LORD came down on mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.
\[21]And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.
\[22]And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth on them.
\[23]And Moses said to the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for you charged us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.
\[24]And the LORD said to him, Away, get you down, and you shall come up, you, and Aaron with you: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break forth on them.

\[4]You shall not make to you any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
\[5]You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;
\[6]And showing mercy to thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
\[7]You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.
\[8]Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
\[9]Six days shall you labor, and do all your work:
\[10]But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates:
\[11]For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: why the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
\[12]Honor your father and your mother: that your days may be long on the land which the LORD your God gives you.
\[13]You shall not kill.
\[14]You shall not commit adultery.
\[15]You shall not steal.
\[16]You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
\[17]You shall not covet your neighbor's house, you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is your neighbor's.
\[18]And all the people saw the thunder, and the lightning, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.
\[19]And they said to Moses, Speak you with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
\[20]And Moses said to the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that you sin not.
\[21]And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.
\[22]And the LORD said to Moses, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, You have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
\[23]You shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall you make to you gods of gold.
\[24]An altar of earth you shall make to me, and shall sacrifice thereon your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, your sheep, and your oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come to you, and I will bless you.
\[25]And if you will make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone: for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it.
\[26]Neither shall you go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness be not discovered thereon.

\[3]If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.
\[4]If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.
\[5]And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:
\[6]Then his master shall bring him to the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.
\[7]And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.
\[8]If she please not her master, who has betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her to a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he has dealt deceitfully with her.
\[9]And if he have betrothed her to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
\[10]If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.
\[11]And if he do not these three to her, then shall she go out free without money.
\[12]He that smites a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.
\[13]And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint you a place where he shall flee.
\[14]But if a man come presumptuously on his neighbor, to slay him with guile; you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.
\[15]And he that smites his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.
\[16]And he that steals a man, and sells him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.
\[17]And he that curses his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.
\[18]And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keeps his bed:
\[19]If he rise again, and walk abroad on his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.
\[20]And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.
\[21]Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.
\[22]If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay on him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.
\[23]And if any mischief follow, then you shall give life for life,
\[24]Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
\[25]Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
\[26]And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.
\[27]And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.

\[29]I will not drive them out from before you in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against you.
\[30]By little and little I will drive them out from before you, until you be increased, and inherit the land.
\[31]And I will set your bounds from the Red sea even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and you shall drive them out before you.
\[32]You shall make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

\[5]And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the LORD.
\[6]And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
\[7]And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD has said will we do, and be obedient.
\[8]And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you concerning all these words.
\[9]Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:
\[10]And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.
\[11]And on the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.
\[12]And the LORD said to Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give you tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that you may teach them.
\[13]And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.
\[14]And he said to the elders, Tarry you here for us, until we come again to you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come to them.
\[15]And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.
\[16]And the glory of the LORD stayed on mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called to Moses out of the middle of the cloud.
\[17]And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.

\[32]And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the middle thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent.
\[33]And beneath on the hem of it you shall make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:
\[34]A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, on the hem of the robe round about.
\[35]And it shall be on Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be heard when he goes in to the holy place before the LORD, and when he comes out, that he die not.
\[36]And you shall make a plate of pure gold, and grave on it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.
\[37]And you shall put it on a blue lace, that it may be on the turban; on the forefront of the turban it shall be.
\[38]And it shall be on Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always on his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.
\[39]And you shall embroider the coat of fine linen, and you shall make the turban of fine linen, and you shall make the girdle of needlework.
\[40]And for Aaron's sons you shall make coats, and you shall make for them girdles, and bonnets shall you make for them, for glory and for beauty.
\[41]And you shall put them on Aaron your brother, and his sons with him; and shall anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priest's office.
\[42]And you shall make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even to the thighs they shall reach:
\[43]And they shall be on Aaron, and on his sons, when they come in to the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near to the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for ever to him and his seed after him.

\[2]And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shall you make them.
\[3]And you shall put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.
\[4]And Aaron and his sons you shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall wash them with water.
\[5]And you shall take the garments, and put on Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:

\[10]And you shall cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands on the head of the bullock.
\[11]And you shall kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[12]And you shall take of the blood of the bullock, and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.
\[13]And you shall take all the fat that covers the inwards, and the lobe that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, and burn them on the altar.
\[14]But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shall you burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering.
\[15]You shall also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands on the head of the ram.
\[16]And you shall slay the ram, and you shall take his blood, and sprinkle it round about on the altar.
\[17]And you shall cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them to his pieces, and to his head.
\[18]And you shall burn the whole ram on the altar: it is a burnt offering to the LORD: it is a sweet smell, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
\[19]And you shall take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands on the head of the ram.
\[20]Then shall you kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and on the tip of the right ear of his sons, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood on the altar round about.
\[21]And you shall take of the blood that is on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
\[22]Also you shall take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covers the inwards, and the lobe above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:
\[23]And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD:

\[26]And you shall take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be your part.
\[27]And you shall sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:
\[28]And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering to the LORD.
\[29]And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.
\[30]And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he comes into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place.
\[31]And you shall take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place.
\[32]And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[33]And they shall eat those things with which the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.
\[34]And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain to the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.
\[35]And thus shall you do to Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded you: seven days shall you consecrate them.
\[36]And you shall offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and you shall cleanse the altar, when you have made an atonement for it, and you shall anoint it, to sanctify it.
\[37]Seven days you shall make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatever touches the altar shall be holy.
\[38]Now this is that which you shall offer on the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.
\[39]The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; and the other lamb you shall offer at even:
\[40]And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.
\[41]And the other lamb you shall offer at even, and shall do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet smell, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
\[42]This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there to you.
\[43]And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.
\[44]And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office.
\[45]And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.
\[46]And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their God.

\[13]This they shall give, every one that passes among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.
\[14]Every one that passes among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering to the LORD.

\[21]So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.

\[23]Take you also to you principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,
\[24]And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:

\[4]To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
\[5]And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.
\[6]And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you;

\[14]You shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy to you: every one that defiles it shall surely be put to death: for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
\[15]Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whoever does any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.
\[16]Why the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.

nd when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
\[2]And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.
\[3]And all the people broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.
\[4]And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a engraving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
\[5]And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.
\[6]And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
\[7]And the LORD said to Moses, Go, get you down; for your people, which you brought out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:
\[8]They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be your gods, O Israel, which have brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
\[9]And the LORD said to Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff necked people:
\[10]Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of you a great nation.
\[11]And Moses sought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why does your wrath wax hot against your people, which you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?
\[12]Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.
\[13]Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.
\[14]And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do to his people.
\[15]And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.
\[16]And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven on the tables.
\[17]And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.
\[18]And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.
\[19]And it came to pass, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mount.
\[20]And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.
\[21]And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people to you, that you have brought so great a sin on them?
\[22]And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: you know the people, that they are set on mischief.
\[23]For they said to me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
\[24]And I said to them, Whoever has any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.
\[25]And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked to their shame among their enemies:)
\[26]Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's side? let him come to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.
\[27]And he said to them, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.
\[28]And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
\[29]For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man on his son, and on his brother; that he may bestow on you a blessing this day.
\[30]And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said to the people, You have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up to the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.
\[31]And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.
\[32]Yet now, if you will forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written.
\[33]And the LORD said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
\[34]Therefore now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you: behold, my Angel shall go before you: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin on them.

\[2]And I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
\[3]To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the middle of you; for you are a stiff necked people: lest I consume you in the way.
\[4]And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.
\[5]For the LORD had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, You are a stiff necked people: I will come up into the middle of you in a moment, and consume you: therefore now put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what to do to you.
\[6]And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.
\[7]And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.
\[8]And it came to pass, when Moses went out to the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.
\[9]And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.
\[10]And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.
\[11]And the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.
\[12]And Moses said to the LORD, See, you say to me, Bring up this people: and you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, I know you by name, and you have also found grace in my sight.
\[13]Now therefore, I pray you, if I have found grace in your sight, show me now your way, that I may know you, that I may find grace in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people.
\[14]And he said, My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest.
\[15]And he said to him, If your presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.
\[16]For wherein shall it be known here that I and your people have found grace in your sight? is it not in that you go with us? so shall we be separated, I and your people, from all the people that are on the face of the earth.
\[17]And the LORD said to Moses, I will do this thing also that you have spoken: for you have found grace in my sight, and I know you by name.
\[18]And he said, I beseech you, show me your glory.
\[19]And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.
\[20]And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.
\[21]And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand on a rock:
\[22]And it shall come to pass, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand while I pass by:
\[23]And I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.

\[3]And no man shall come up with you, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.
\[4]And he hewed two tables of stone like to the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.
\[5]And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.
\[6]And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,
\[7]Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children's children, to the third and to the fourth generation.
\[8]And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.
\[9]And he said, If now I have found grace in your sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray you, go among us; for it is a stiff necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.
\[10]And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which you are shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with you.
\[11]Observe you that which I command you this day: behold, I drive out before you the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
\[12]Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you go, lest it be for a snare in the middle of you:
\[13]But you shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:
\[14]For you shall worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:
\[15]Lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice to their gods, and one call you, and you eat of his sacrifice;
\[16]And you take of their daughters to your sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make your sons go a whoring after their gods.
\[17]You shall make you no molten gods.

\[19]All that opens the matrix is mine; and every firstling among your cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.
\[20]But the firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb: and if you redeem him not, then shall you break his neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.
\[21]Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in ripening time and in harvest you shall rest.
\[22]And you shall observe the feast of weeks, of the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.
\[23]Thrice in the year shall all your male children appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.
\[24]For I will cast out the nations before you, and enlarge your borders: neither shall any man desire your land, when you shall go up to appear before the LORD your God thrice in the year.
\[25]You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left to the morning.
\[26]The first of the first fruits of your land you shall bring to the house of the LORD your God. You shall not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.
\[27]And the LORD said to Moses, Write you these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.
\[28]And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote on the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
\[29]And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.
\[30]And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him.
\[31]And Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him: and Moses talked with them.
\[32]And afterward all the children of Israel came near: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.
\[33]And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.
\[34]But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out. And he came out, and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded.
\[35]And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

\[3]And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it with. And they brought yet to him free offerings every morning.
\[4]And all the wise men, that worked all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;
\[5]And they spoke to Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.
\[6]And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.
\[7]For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.

\[4]And you shall bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order on it; and you shall bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.
\[5]And you shall set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.
\[6]And you shall set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.
\[7]And you shall set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shall put water therein.
\[8]And you shall set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.
\[9]And you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shall hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.
\[10]And you shall anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.
\[11]And you shall anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.
\[12]And you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

\[15]And you shall anoint them, as you did anoint their father, that they may minister to me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.
\[16]Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.
\[17]And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.
\[18]And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.
\[19]And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above on it; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[20]And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark:
\[21]And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[22]And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, on the side of the tabernacle northward, without the veil.
\[23]And he set the bread in order on it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
\[24]And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.
\[25]And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[26]And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the veil:
\[27]And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[28]And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.
\[29]And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[30]And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash with.
\[31]And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:
\[32]When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near to the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[33]And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.
\[34]Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
\[35]And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud stayed thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
\[36]And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:
\[37]But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.
\[38]For the cloud of the LORD was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.

\[24]And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar round about.
\[25]And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was on the inwards, and the lobe above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:
\[26]And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and on the right shoulder:
\[27]And he put all on Aaron's hands, and on his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.
\[28]And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar on the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet smell: it is an offering made by fire to the LORD.
\[29]And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[30]And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
\[31]And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
\[32]And that which remains of the flesh and of the bread shall you burn with fire.
\[33]And you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.
\[34]As he has done this day, so the LORD has commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.
\[35]Therefore shall you abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that you die not: for so I am commanded.
\[36]So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.

nd it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
\[2]And he said to Aaron, Take you a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.
\[3]And to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, Take you a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;
\[4]Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear to you.
\[5]And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
\[6]And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that you should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear to you.
\[7]And Moses said to Aaron, Go to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make an atonement for yourself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.
\[8]Aaron therefore went to the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
\[9]And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:
\[10]But the fat, and the kidneys, and the lobe above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt on the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[11]And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
\[12]And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled round about on the altar.
\[13]And they presented the burnt offering to him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them on the altar.
\[14]And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them on the burnt offering on the altar.
\[15]And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
\[16]And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.
\[17]And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it on the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.
\[18]He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled on the altar round about,
\[19]And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covers the inwards, and the kidneys, and the lobe above the liver:
\[20]And they put the fat on the breasts, and he burnt the fat on the altar:
\[21]And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.
\[22]And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.
\[23]And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
\[24]And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed on the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.

\[2]And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.
\[3]Then Moses said to Aaron, This is it that the LORD spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.
\[4]And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Come near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
\[5]So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.
\[6]And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest you die, and lest wrath come on all the people: but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, mourn the burning which the LORD has kindled.
\[7]And you shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest you die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is on you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
\[8]And the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying,
\[9]Do not drink wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest you die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:
\[10]And that you may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;
\[11]And that you may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD has spoken to them by the hand of Moses.
\[12]And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remains of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:
\[13]And you shall eat it in the holy place, because it is your due, and your sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.
\[14]And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall you eat in a clean place; you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they be your due, and your sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.
\[15]The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be yours, and your sons' with you, by a statute for ever; as the LORD has commanded.
\[16]And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,
\[17]Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God has given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?
\[18]Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: you should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.
\[19]And Aaron said to Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?
\[20]And when Moses heard that, he was content.

\[3]And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.
\[4]If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that has the plague seven days:
\[5]And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:
\[6]And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
\[7]But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he has been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again.
\[8]And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreads in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.

\[27]And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD:
\[28]And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand on the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the trespass offering:
\[29]And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put on the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the LORD.

\[31]Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD.
\[32]This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get that which pertains to his cleansing.
\[33]And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
\[34]When you be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;
\[35]And he that ownes the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seems to me there is as it were a plague in the house:
\[36]Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:
\[37]And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;
\[38]Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days:
\[39]And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;
\[40]Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:
\[41]And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:
\[42]And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.
\[43]And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he has taken away the stones, and after he has scraped the house, and after it is plastered;
\[44]Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean.
\[45]And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.
\[46]Moreover he that goes into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.
\[47]And he that lies in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eats in the house shall wash his clothes.
\[48]And if the priest shall come in, and look on it, and, behold, the plague has not spread in the house, after the house was plastered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
\[49]And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
\[50]And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:
\[51]And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:
\[52]And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:
\[53]But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.
\[54]This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scale,
\[55]And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,
\[56]And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:
\[57]To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.

\[2]And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to Aaron your brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil before the mercy seat, which is on the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat.
\[3]Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.
\[4]He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches on his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen turban shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.
\[5]And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.
\[6]And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.
\[7]And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[8]And Aaron shall cast lots on the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.
\[9]And Aaron shall bring the goat on which the LORD's lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.
\[10]But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.
\[11]And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:
\[12]And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:
\[13]And he shall put the incense on the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is on the testimony, that he die not:
\[14]And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.
\[15]Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:
\[16]And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remains among them in the middle of their uncleanness.
\[17]And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goes in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.
\[18]And he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar round about.
\[19]And he shall sprinkle of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.

\[22]And the goat shall bear on him all their iniquities to a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.
\[23]And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:
\[24]And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.
\[25]And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn on the altar.
\[26]And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.
\[27]And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.
\[28]And he that burns them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
\[29]And this shall be a statute for ever to you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojournes among you:
\[30]For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that you may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.
\[31]It shall be a sabbath of rest to you, and you shall afflict your souls, by a statute for ever.
\[32]And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments:
\[33]And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.

\[6]And the priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet smell to the LORD.

\[11]For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you on the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul.
\[12]Therefore I said to the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojournes among you eat blood.
\[13]And whatever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunts and catches any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.
\[14]For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said to the children of Israel, You shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whoever eats it shall be cut off.
\[15]And every soul that eats that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.

\[23]And you shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
\[24]But I have said to you, You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land that flows with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people.
\[25]You shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and you shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creeps on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.
\[26]And you shall be holy to me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that you should be mine.
\[27]A man also or woman that has a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be on them.

\[2]But for his kin, that is near to him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother.
\[3]And for his sister a virgin, that is near to him, which has had no husband; for her may he be defiled.
\[4]But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.
\[5]They shall not make baldness on their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
\[6]They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.
\[7]They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy to his God.
\[8]You shall sanctify him therefore; for he offers the bread of your God: he shall be holy to you: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy.
\[9]And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profanes her father: she shall be burnt with fire.
\[10]And he that is the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;
\[11]Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;
\[12]Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is on him: I am the LORD.
\[13]And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
\[14]A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.
\[15]Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.
\[16]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[17]Speak to Aaron, saying, Whoever he be of your seed in their generations that has any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.
\[18]For whatever man he be that has a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that has a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,
\[19]Or a man that is broken footed, or broken handed,
\[20]Or hunch back, or a dwarf, or that has a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or has his stones broken;
\[21]No man that has a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come near to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he has a blemish; he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.
\[22]He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.
\[23]Only he shall not go in to the veil, nor come near to the altar, because he has a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

\[3]Say to them, Whoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goes to the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow to the LORD, having his uncleanness on him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.
\[4]What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or has a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoever touches any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goes from him;
\[5]Or whoever touches any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatever uncleanness he has;
\[6]The soul which has touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.
\[7]And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.

\[19]You shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.

\[27]When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thereafter it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire to the LORD.
\[28]And whether it be cow, or ewe, you shall not kill it and her young both in one day.
\[29]And when you will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, offer it at your own will.

\[4]But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest to the land, a sabbath for the LORD: you shall neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard.
\[5]That which grows of its own accord of your harvest you shall not reap, neither gather the grapes of your vine undressed: for it is a year of rest to the land.
\[6]And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for you, and for your servant, and for your maid, and for your hired servant, and for your stranger that sojournes with you.
\[7]And for your cattle, and for the beast that are in your land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.
\[8]And you shall number seven sabbaths of years to you, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be to you forty and nine years.
\[9]Then shall you cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
\[10]And you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee to you; and you shall return every man to his possession, and you shall return every man to his family.
\[11]A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be to you: you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of your vine undressed.
\[12]For it is the jubilee; it shall be holy to you: you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
\[13]In the year of this jubilee you shall return every man to his possession.
\[14]And if you sell ought to your neighbor, or buy ought of your neighbor's hand, you shall not oppress one another:
\[15]According to the number of years after the jubilee you shall buy of your neighbor, and according to the number of years of the fruits he shall sell to you:
\[16]According to the multitude of years you shall increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years you shall diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits does he sell to you.

\[21]Then I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.
\[22]And you shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in you shall eat of the old store.
\[23]The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for you are strangers and sojourners with me.
\[24]And in all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption for the land.

\[27]Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the remainder to the man to whom he sold it; that he may return to his possession.
\[28]But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that has bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.
\[29]And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.
\[30]And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubilee.
\[31]But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.

\[49]Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is near of kin to him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.
\[50]And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him to the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.
\[51]If there be yet many years behind, according to them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
\[52]And if there remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him, and according to his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.
\[53]And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigor over him in your sight.
\[54]And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, both he, and his children with him.

\[31]And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not smell the smell of your sweet odors.
\[32]And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
\[33]And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.
\[34]Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.
\[35]As long as it lies desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when you dwelled on it.
\[36]And on them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursues.
\[37]And they shall fall one on another, as it were before a sword, when none pursues: and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
\[38]And you shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
\[39]And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
\[40]If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary to me;
\[41]And that I also have walked contrary to them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:
\[42]Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
\[43]The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lies desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.
\[44]And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God.
\[45]But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.
\[46]These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.

nd the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[2]Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by your estimation.
\[3]And your estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
\[4]And if it be a female, then your estimation shall be thirty shekels.
\[5]And if it be from five years old even to twenty years old, then your estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
\[6]And if it be from a month old even to five years old, then your estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female your estimation shall be three shekels of silver.
\[7]And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then your estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
\[8]But if he be poorer than your estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.
\[9]And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering to the LORD, all that any man gives of such to the LORD shall be holy.
\[10]He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.
\[11]And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice to the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:
\[12]And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as you value it, who are the priest, so shall it be.
\[13]But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof to your estimation.
\[14]And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
\[15]And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be his.
\[16]And if a man shall sanctify to the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then your estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
\[17]If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to your estimation it shall stand.
\[18]But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain, even to the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from your estimation.
\[19]And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be assured to him.
\[20]And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
\[21]But the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.
\[22]And if a man sanctify to the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;
\[23]Then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your estimation, even to the year of the jubilee: and he shall give your estimation in that day, as a holy thing to the LORD.
\[24]In the year of the jubilee the field shall return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.
\[25]And all your estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
\[26]Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD's.
\[27]And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to your estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your estimation.
\[28]Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.
\[29]None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.
\[30]And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy to the LORD.
\[31]And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.
\[32]And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD.
\[33]He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
\[34]These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.

\[2]Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that has an issue, and whoever is defiled by the dead:
\[3]Both male and female shall you put out, without the camp shall you put them; that they defile not their camps, in the middle whereof I dwell.
\[4]And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the LORD spoke to Moses, so did the children of Israel.
\[5]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[6]Speak to the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty;
\[7]Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add to it the fifth part thereof, and give it to him against whom he has trespassed.
\[8]But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass to, let the trespass be recompensed to the LORD, even to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.
\[9]And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring to the priest, shall be his.
\[10]And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatever any man gives the priest, it shall be his.
\[11]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[12]Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, If any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,
\[13]And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner;
\[14]And the spirit of jealousy come on him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come on him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:
\[15]Then shall the man bring his wife to the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil on it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
\[16]And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:
\[17]And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water:
\[18]And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causes the curse:
\[19]And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say to the woman, If no man have lain with you, and if you have not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of your husband, be you free from this bitter water that causes the curse:
\[20]But if you have gone aside to another instead of your husband, and if you be defiled, and some man have lain with you beside your husband:
\[21]Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say to the woman, The LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the LORD does make your thigh to rot, and your belly to swell;
\[22]And this water that causes the curse shall go into your bowels, to make your belly to swell, and your thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.
\[23]And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water:
\[24]And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causes the curse: and the water that causes the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.
\[25]Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it on the altar:
\[26]And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.
\[27]And when he has made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causes the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.
\[28]And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.
\[29]This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goes aside to another instead of her husband, and is defiled;
\[30]Or when the spirit of jealousy comes on him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute on her all this law.

\[4]All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.

\[6]All the days that he separates himself to the LORD he shall come at no dead body.
\[7]He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is on his head.
\[8]All the days of his separation he is holy to the LORD.
\[9]And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he has defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.

\[14]And he shall offer his offering to the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,

\[18]And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.
\[19]And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his separation is shaven:
\[20]And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.
\[21]This is the law of the Nazarite who has vowed, and of his offering to the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation.

\[17]For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.

\[7]And those men said to him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: why are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?
\[8]And Moses said to them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.
\[9]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[10]Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover to the LORD.

\[12]They shall leave none of it to the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.
\[13]But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and declines to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
\[14]And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover to the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: you shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.

\[17]And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud stayed, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.

nd the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[2]Make you two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shall you make them: that you may use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.
\[3]And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to you at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[4]And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.
\[5]When you blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.
\[6]When you blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
\[7]But when the congregation is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.
\[8]And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.
\[9]And if you go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresses you, then you shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and you shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies.
\[10]Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.
\[11]And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.
\[12]And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.
\[13]And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
\[14]In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
\[15]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar.
\[16]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.
\[17]And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.
\[18]And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
\[19]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
\[20]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
\[21]And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came.
\[22]And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.
\[23]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
\[24]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.
\[25]And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, which was the rear guard of all the camps throughout their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
\[26]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.
\[27]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
\[28]Thus were the journeys of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward.
\[29]And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying to the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come you with us, and we will do you good: for the LORD has spoken good concerning Israel.
\[30]And he said to him, I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my kindred.
\[31]And he said, Leave us not, I pray you; for as much as you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you may be to us instead of eyes.
\[32]And it shall be, if you go with us, yes, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do to us, the same will we do to you.
\[33]And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.
\[34]And the cloud of the LORD was on them by day, when they went out of the camp.
\[35]And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let your enemies be scattered; and let them that hate you flee before you.
\[36]And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, to the many thousands of Israel.

nd when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.
\[2]And the people cried to Moses; and when Moses prayed to the LORD, the fire was quenched.
\[3]And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.
\[4]And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?
\[5]We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:
\[6]But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.
\[7]And the manna was as coriander seed, and the color thereof as the color of bdellium.
\[8]And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
\[9]And when the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.
\[10]Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.
\[11]And Moses said to the LORD, Why have you afflicted your servant? and why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?
\[12]Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that you should say to me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nursing father bears the sucking child, to the land which you swore to their fathers?
\[13]From where should I have flesh to give to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.
\[14]I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.
\[15]And if you deal thus with me, kill me, I pray you, out of hand, if I have found favor in your sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.
\[16]And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with you.
\[17]And I will come down and talk with you there: and I will take of the spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you bear it not yourself alone.
\[18]And say you to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and you shall eat flesh: for you have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and you shall eat.
\[19]You shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;
\[20]But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome to you: because that you have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?
\[21]And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and you have said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.
\[22]Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them?  or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?
\[23]And the LORD said to Moses, Is the LORD's hand waxed short? you shall see now whether my word shall come to pass to you or not.
\[24]And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.
\[25]And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was on him, and gave it to the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested on them, they prophesied, and did not cease.
\[26]But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested on them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out to the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.
\[27]And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.
\[28]And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.
\[29]And Moses said to him, Envy you for my sake? would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit on them!
\[30]And Moses got him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
\[31]And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high on the face of the earth.
\[32]And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
\[33]And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.
\[34]And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.
\[35]And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah to Hazeroth; and stayed at Hazeroth.

\[2]And they said, Has the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? has he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.
\[3](Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were on the face of the earth.)
\[4]And the LORD spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, Come out you three to the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.
\[5]And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.
\[6]And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream.
\[7]My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.
\[8]With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?
\[9]And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.
\[10]And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked on Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.
\[11]And Aaron said to Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech you, lay not the sin on us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.
\[12]Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.
\[13]And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech you.
\[14]And the LORD said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.
\[15]And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.

\[2]Send you men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall you send a man, every one a ruler among them.
\[3]And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel.
\[4]And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.
\[5]Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
\[6]Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
\[7]Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
\[8]Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.
\[9]Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
\[10]Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
\[11]Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.
\[12]Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
\[13]Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
\[14]Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
\[15]Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
\[16]These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land.  And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.
\[17]And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:
\[18]And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwells therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;
\[19]And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;
\[20]And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be you of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.
\[21]So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, as men come to Hamath.
\[22]And they ascended by the south, and came to Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
\[23]And they came to the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it between two on a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
\[24]The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from there.
\[25]And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
\[26]And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
\[27]And they told him, and said, We came to the land where you sent us, and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.
\[28]Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.
\[29]The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.
\[30]And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
\[31]But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.
\[32]And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched to the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eats up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.
\[33]And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.

\[2]And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said to them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!
\[3]And why has the LORD brought us to this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?
\[4]And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
\[5]Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
\[6]And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:
\[7]And they spoke to all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.
\[8]If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which flows with milk and honey.
\[9]Only rebel not you against the LORD, neither fear you the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.
\[10]But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.
\[11]And the LORD said to Moses, How long will this people provoke me?  and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have showed among them?
\[12]I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a greater nation and mightier than they.
\[13]And Moses said to the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for you brought up this people in your might from among them;)
\[14]And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that you LORD are among this people, that you LORD are seen face to face, and that your cloud stands over them, and that you go before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.
\[15]Now if you shall kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying,
\[16]Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.
\[17]And now, I beseech you, let the power of my LORD be great, according as you have spoken, saying,
\[18]The LORD is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation.
\[19]Pardon, I beseech you, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your mercy, and as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.
\[20]And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to your word:
\[21]But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.
\[22]Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not listened to my voice;
\[23]Surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:
\[24]But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land into where he went; and his seed shall possess it.
\[25](Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelled in the valley.) Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
\[26]And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
\[27]How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.
\[28]Say to them, As truly as I live, said the LORD, as you have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you:
\[29]Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against me.
\[30]Doubtless you shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
\[31]But your little ones, which you said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which you have despised.
\[32]But as for you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness.
\[33]And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your prostitutions, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.
\[34]After the number of the days in which you searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall you bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you shall know my breach of promise.
\[35]I the LORD have said, I will surely do it to all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.
\[36]And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander on the land,
\[37]Even those men that did bring up the evil report on the land, died by the plague before the LORD.
\[38]But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.
\[39]And Moses told these sayings to all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.
\[40]And they rose up early in the morning, and got them up into the top of the mountain, saying, See, we be here, and will go up to the place which the LORD has promised: for we have sinned.
\[41]And Moses said, Why now do you transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.
\[42]Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that you be not smitten before your enemies.
\[43]For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you shall fall by the sword: because you are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.
\[44]But they presumed to go up to the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.
\[45]Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelled in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even to Hormah.

\[4]Then shall he that offers his offering to the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil.

\[16]One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojournes with you.

\[19]Then it shall be, that, when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up an heave offering to the LORD.

\[29]You shall have one law for him that sins through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojournes among them.

\[3]And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, You take too much on you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: why then lift you up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?
\[4]And when Moses heard it, he fell on his face:
\[5]And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will show who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near to him: even him whom he has chosen will he cause to come near to him.
\[6]This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;
\[7]And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD does choose, he shall be holy: you take too much on you, you sons of Levi.
\[8]And Moses said to Korah, Hear, I pray you, you sons of Levi:
\[9]Seems it but a small thing to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them?
\[10]And he has brought you near to him, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you: and seek you the priesthood also?
\[11]For which cause both you and all your company are gathered together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that you murmur against him?
\[12]And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:
\[13]Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land that flows with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except you make yourself altogether a prince over us?
\[14]Moreover you have not brought us into a land that flows with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: will you put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.
\[15]And Moses was very wroth, and said to the LORD, Respect not you their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.
\[16]And Moses said to Korah, Be you and all your company before the LORD, you, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:
\[17]And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring you before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.
\[18]And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.
\[19]And Korah gathered all the congregation against them to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.
\[20]And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
\[21]Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
\[22]And they fell on their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be wroth with all the congregation?
\[23]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[24]Speak to the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
\[25]And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
\[26]And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest you be consumed in all their sins.
\[27]So they got up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.
\[28]And Moses said, Hereby you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of my own mind.
\[29]If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD has not sent me.
\[30]But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain to them, and they go down quick into the pit; then you shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.
\[31]And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground split asunder that was under them:
\[32]And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to Korah, and all their goods.
\[33]They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed on them: and they perished from among the congregation.
\[34]And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.
\[35]And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.
\[36]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[37]Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter you the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.
\[38]The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.
\[39]And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, with which they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:
\[40]To be a memorial to the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.
\[41]But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, You have killed the people of the LORD.
\[42]And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.
\[43]And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[44]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[45]Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell on their faces.
\[46]And Moses said to Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly to the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.
\[47]And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the middle of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.
\[48]And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
\[49]Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.
\[50]And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.

\[3]And you shall write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.
\[4]And you shall lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.
\[5]And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.
\[6]And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.
\[7]And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.
\[8]And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.
\[9]And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD to all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.
\[10]And the LORD said to Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and you shall quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.
\[11]And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.
\[12]And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.
\[13]Whoever comes any thing near to the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

\[2]And your brothers also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, bring you with you, that they may be joined to you, and minister to you: but you and your sons with you shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.
\[3]And they shall keep your charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come near the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor you also, die.
\[4]And they shall be joined to you, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come near to you.
\[5]And you shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more on the children of Israel.
\[6]And I, behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[7]Therefore you and your sons with you shall keep your priest's office for everything of the altar, and within the veil; and you shall serve: I have given your priest's office to you as a service of gift: and the stranger that comes near shall be put to death.
\[8]And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Behold, I also have given you the charge of my heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to you have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, by an ordinance for ever.
\[9]This shall be your of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons.
\[10]In the most holy place shall you eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy to you.
\[11]And this is yours; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in your house shall eat of it.
\[12]All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first fruits of them which they shall offer to the LORD, them have I given you.
\[13]And whatever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring to the LORD, shall be yours; every one that is clean in your house shall eat of it.
\[14]Every thing devoted in Israel shall be yours.
\[15]Every thing that opens the matrix in all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be yours: nevertheless the firstborn of man shall you surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shall you redeem.
\[16]And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shall you redeem, according to your estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.
\[17]But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy: you shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet smell to the LORD.
\[18]And the flesh of them shall be yours, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are yours.
\[19]All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, have I given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD to you and to your seed with you.
\[20]And the LORD spoke to Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any part among them: I am your part and your inheritance among the children of Israel.
\[21]And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[22]Neither must the children of Israel from now on come near the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.
\[23]But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.
\[24]But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
\[25]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[26]Thus speak to the Levites, and say to them, When you take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.
\[27]And this your heave offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it were the corn of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the wine press.
\[28]Thus you also shall offer an heave offering to the LORD of all your tithes, which you receive of the children of Israel; and you shall give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest.
\[29]Out of all your gifts you shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.
\[30]Therefore you shall say to them, When you have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted to the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the wine press.
\[31]And you shall eat it in every place, you and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[32]And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall you pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest you die.

\[3]And you shall give her to Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:
\[4]And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:
\[5]And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:
\[6]And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the middle of the burning of the heifer.
\[7]Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.

\[9]And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.
\[10]And he that gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be to the children of Israel, and to the stranger that sojournes among them, for a statute for ever.

\[13]Whoever touches the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifies not himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet on him.
\[14]This is the law, when a man dies in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
\[15]And every open vessel, which has no covering bound on it, is unclean.
\[16]And whoever touches one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.

\[3]And the people strived with Moses, and spoke, saying, Would God that we had died when our brothers died before the LORD!
\[4]And why have you brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?
\[5]And why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.
\[6]And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell on their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared to them.
\[7]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[8]Take the rod, and gather you the assembly together, you, and Aaron your brother, and speak you to the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and you shall bring forth to them water out of the rock: so you shall give the congregation and their beasts drink.
\[9]And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.
\[10]And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, you rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?
\[11]And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.
\[12]And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, Because you believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.
\[13]This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.
\[14]And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus said your brother Israel, You know all the travail that has befallen us:
\[15]How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelled in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:
\[16]And when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and has brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of your border:
\[17]Let us pass, I pray you, through your country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your borders.
\[18]And Edom said to him, You shall not pass by me, lest I come out against you with the sword.
\[19]And the children of Israel said to him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of your water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.
\[20]And he said, You shall not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.
\[21]Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: why Israel turned away from him.
\[22]And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came to mount Hor.
\[23]And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,
\[24]Aaron shall be gathered to his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.
\[25]Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to mount Hor:
\[26]And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered to his people, and shall die there.
\[27]And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
\[28]And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.

\[3]And the LORD listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.
\[4]And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
\[5]And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loathes this light bread.
\[6]And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
\[7]Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against you; pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
\[8]And the LORD said to Moses, Make you a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looks on it, shall live.
\[9]And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it on a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
\[10]And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.
\[11]And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sun rise.
\[12]From there they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.
\[13]From there they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
\[14]Why it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,
\[15]And at the stream of the brooks that goes down to the dwelling of Ar, and lies on the border of Moab.
\[16]And from there they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD spoke to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.
\[17]Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing you to it:
\[18]The princes dig the well, the nobles of the people dig it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:
\[19]And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
\[20]And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks toward Jeshimon.
\[21]And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
\[22]Let me pass through your land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past your borders.
\[23]And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
\[24]And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
\[25]And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.
\[26]For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.
\[27]Why they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:
\[28]For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it has consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.
\[29]Woe to you, Moab! you are undone, O people of Chemosh: he has given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.
\[30]We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even to Dibon, and we have laid them waste even to Nophah, which reaches to Medeba.
\[31]Thus Israel dwelled in the land of the Amorites.
\[32]And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.
\[33]And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.
\[34]And the LORD said to Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people, and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelled at Heshbon.
\[35]So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.

\[6]Come now therefore, I pray you, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.

\[12]And God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people: for they are blessed.
\[13]And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuses to give me leave to go with you.
\[14]And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.
\[15]And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.

\[18]And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.
\[19]Now therefore, I pray you, tarry you also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say to me more.
\[20]And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men come to call you, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say to you, that shall you do.
\[21]And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
\[22]And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his ass, and his two servants were with him.
\[23]And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.
\[24]But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.
\[25]And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.
\[26]And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
\[27]And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.
\[28]And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have smitten me these three times?
\[29]And Balaam said to the ass, Because you have mocked me: I would there were a sword in my hand, for now would I kill you.
\[30]And the ass said to Balaam, Am not I your ass, on which you have ridden ever since I was your to this day? was I ever wont to do so to you? And he said, No.
\[31]Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.
\[32]And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why have you smitten your ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand you, because your way is perverse before me:
\[33]And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain you, and saved her alive.
\[34]And Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that you stood in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease you, I will get me back again.
\[35]And the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
\[36]And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him to a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast.
\[37]And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to you to call you? why came you not to me? am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?
\[38]And Balaam said to Balak, See, I am come to you: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.
\[39]And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjathhuzoth.
\[40]And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.
\[41]And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that there he might see the utmost part of the people.

\[2]And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.
\[3]And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatever he shows me I will tell you. And he went to an high place.
\[4]And God met Balaam: and he said to him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.
\[5]And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.
\[6]And he returned to him, and, see, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.
\[7]And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.
\[8]How shall I curse, whom God has not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the LORD has not defied?
\[9]For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: see, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
\[10]Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!
\[11]And Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have blessed them altogether.
\[12]And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD has put in my mouth?
\[13]And Balak said to him, Come, I pray you, with me to another place, from from where you may see them: you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them from there.
\[14]And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
\[15]And he said to Balak, Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet the LORD yonder.
\[16]And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again to Balak, and say thus.
\[17]And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, What has the LORD spoken?
\[18]And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; listen to me, you son of Zippor:
\[19]God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: has he said, and shall he not do it? or has he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
\[20]Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he has blessed; and I cannot reverse it.
\[21]He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither has he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.
\[22]God brought them out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn.
\[23]Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God worked!
\[24]Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.
\[25]And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
\[26]But Balaam answered and said to Balak, Told not I you, saying, All that the LORD speaks, that I must do?
\[27]And Balak said to Balaam, Come, I pray you, I will bring you to another place; peradventure it will please God that you may curse me them from there.
\[28]And Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks toward Jeshimon.
\[29]And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
\[30]And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.

\[2]And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came on him.
\[3]And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes are open has said:
\[4]He has said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:
\[5]How goodly are your tents, O Jacob, and your tabernacles, O Israel!
\[6]As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD has planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.
\[7]He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
\[8]God brought him forth out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.
\[9]He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesses you, and cursed is he that curses you.
\[10]And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said to Balaam, I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times.
\[11]Therefore now flee you to your place: I thought to promote you to great honor; but, see, the LORD has kept you back from honor.
\[12]And Balaam said to Balak, Spoke I not also to your messengers which you sent to me, saying,
\[13]If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of my own mind; but what the LORD said, that will I speak?
\[14]And now, behold, I go to my people: come therefore, and I will advertise you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.
\[15]And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes are open has said:
\[16]He has said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:
\[17]I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.
\[18]And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.
\[19]Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remains of the city.
\[20]And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.
\[21]And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is your dwelling place, and you put your nest in a rock.
\[22]Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry you away captive.
\[23]And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God does this!
\[24]And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.

\[4]And the LORD said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.
\[5]And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Slay you every one his men that were joined to Baalpeor.
\[6]And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

\[8]And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
\[9]And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.

\[11]Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.
\[12]Why say, Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace:
\[13]And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.
\[14]Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.
\[15]And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian.
\[16]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[17]Vex the Midianites, and smite them:
\[18]For they vex you with their wiles, with which they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.

\[19]And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.
\[20]And you shall put some of your honor on him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.

\[2]If a man vow a vow to the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
\[3]If a woman also vow a vow to the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth;
\[4]And her father hear her vow, and her bond with which she has bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand.
\[5]But if her father disallow her in the day that he hears; not any of her vows, or of her bonds with which she has bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
\[6]And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, with which she bound her soul;
\[7]And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she bound her soul shall stand.
\[8]But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, with which she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.
\[9]But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, with which they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.
\[10]And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;
\[11]And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand.
\[12]But if her husband has utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband has made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.
\[13]Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
\[14]But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds, which are on her: he confirms them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.
\[15]But if he shall any ways make them void after that he has heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.

nd the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[2]Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shall you be gathered to your people.
\[3]And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves to the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.
\[4]Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall you send to the war.
\[5]So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
\[6]And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.
\[7]And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.
\[8]And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
\[9]And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.
\[10]And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelled, and all their goodly castles, with fire.
\[11]And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.
\[12]And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, to Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.
\[13]And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.
\[14]And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.
\[15]And Moses said to them, Have you saved all the women alive?
\[16]Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.
\[17]Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that has known man by lying with him.
\[18]But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
\[19]And do you abide without the camp seven days: whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.
\[20]And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.
\[21]And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses;
\[22]Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
\[23]Every thing that may abide the fire, you shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that stays not the fire you shall make go through the water.
\[24]And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean, and afterward you shall come into the camp.
\[25]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[26]Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, you, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:
\[27]And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war on them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:
\[28]And levy a tribute to the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:
\[29]Take it of their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD.
\[30]And of the children of Israel's half, you shall take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them to the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.
\[31]And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[32]And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
\[33]And three score and twelve thousand beeves,
\[34]And three score and one thousand asses,
\[35]And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.
\[36]And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:
\[37]And the LORD's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and three score and fifteen.
\[38]And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was three score and twelve.
\[39]And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD's tribute was three score and one.
\[40]And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was thirty and two persons.
\[41]And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave offering, to Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[42]And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,
\[43](Now the half that pertained to the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
\[44]And thirty and six thousand beeves,
\[45]And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,
\[46]And sixteen thousand persons;)
\[47]Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them to the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[48]And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near to Moses:
\[49]And they said to Moses, Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacks not one man of us.
\[50]We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.
\[51]And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all worked jewels.
\[52]And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
\[53](For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)
\[54]And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.

ow the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;
\[2]The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,
\[3]Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
\[4]Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and your servants have cattle:
\[5]Why, said they, if we have found grace in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.
\[6]And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to war, and shall you sit here?
\[7]And why discourage you the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD has given them?
\[8]Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.
\[9]For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.
\[10]And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he swore, saying,
\[11]Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:
\[12]Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.
\[13]And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.
\[14]And, behold, you are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.
\[15]For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you shall destroy all this people.
\[16]And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:
\[17]But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
\[18]We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.
\[19]For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.
\[20]And Moses said to them, If you will do this thing, if you will go armed before the LORD to war,
\[21]And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he has driven out his enemies from before him,
\[22]And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward you shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.
\[23]But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.
\[24]Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.
\[25]And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Your servants will do as my lord commands.
\[26]Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:
\[27]But your servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord said.
\[28]So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:
\[29]And Moses said to them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:
\[30]But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
\[31]And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD has said to your servants, so will we do.
\[32]We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.
\[33]And Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about.
\[34]And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
\[35]And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,
\[36]And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.
\[37]And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,
\[38]And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names to the cities which they built.
\[39]And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.
\[40]And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelled therein.
\[41]And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.
\[42]And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.

\[48]And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.
\[49]And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even to Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.
\[50]And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,
\[51]Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
\[52]Then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:
\[53]And you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.
\[54]And you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falls; according to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit.
\[55]But if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which you let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein you dwell.
\[56]Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do to you, as I thought to do to them.

\[4]And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:

nd the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,
\[2]Command the children of Israel, that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and you shall give also to the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.
\[3]And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.
\[4]And the suburbs of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.
\[5]And you shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the middle: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
\[6]And among the cities which you shall give to the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which you shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them you shall add forty and two cities.
\[7]So all the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall you give with their suburbs.
\[8]And the cities which you shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many you shall give many; but from them that have few you shall give few: every one shall give of his cities to the Levites according to his inheritance which he inherits.
\[9]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[10]Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
\[11]Then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which kills any person at unawares.
\[12]And they shall be to you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.
\[13]And of these cities which you shall give six cities shall you have for refuge.
\[14]You shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall you give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.
\[15]These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that kills any person unawares may flee thither.
\[16]And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\[17]And if he smite him with throwing a stone, with which he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\[18]Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, with which he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\[19]The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meets him, he shall slay him.
\[20]But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;
\[21]Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meets him.
\[22]But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast on him any thing without laying of wait,
\[23]Or with any stone, with which a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it on him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:
\[24]Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments:
\[25]And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, where he was fled: and he shall abide in it to the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.
\[26]But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, where he was fled;
\[27]And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:
\[28]Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.
\[29]So these things shall be for a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
\[30]Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.
\[31]Moreover you shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.
\[32]And you shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
\[33]So you shall not pollute the land wherein you are: for blood it defiles the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.
\[34]Defile not therefore the land which you shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.

nd the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:
\[2]And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
\[3]And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
\[4]And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
\[5]And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph has said well.
\[6]This is the thing which the LORD does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.
\[7]So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
\[8]And every daughter, that possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.
\[9]Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.
\[10]Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
\[11]For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons:
\[12]And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
\[13]These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

hese be the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
\[2](There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadeshbarnea.)
\[3]And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the LORD had given him in commandment to them;
\[4]After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelled in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelled at Astaroth in Edrei:
\[5]On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,
\[6]The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have dwelled long enough in this mount:
\[7]Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and to all the places near thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and to Lebanon, to the great river, the river Euphrates.
\[8]Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.
\[9]And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:
\[10]The LORD your God has multiplied you, and, behold, you are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
\[11](The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as you are, and bless you, as he has promised you!)
\[12]How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
\[13]Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.
\[14]And you answered me, and said, The thing which you have spoken is good for us to do.
\[15]So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.
\[16]And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brothers, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.
\[17]You shall not respect persons in judgment; but you shall hear the small as well as the great; you shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it to me, and I will hear it.
\[18]And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.
\[19]And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which you saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.
\[20]And I said to you, You are come to the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God does give to us.
\[21]Behold, the LORD your God has set the land before you: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of your fathers has said to you; fear not, neither be discouraged.
\[22]And you came near to me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.
\[23]And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:
\[24]And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.
\[25]And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God does give us.
\[26]Notwithstanding you would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:
\[27]And you murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
\[28]Where shall we go up? our brothers have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.
\[29]Then I said to you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
\[30]The LORD your God which goes before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;
\[31]And in the wilderness, where you have seen how that the LORD your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came into this place.
\[32]Yet in this thing you did not believe the LORD your God,
\[33]Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in a cloud by day.
\[34]And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying,
\[35]Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I swore to give to your fathers.
\[36]Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he has trodden on, and to his children, because he has wholly followed the LORD.
\[37]Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, You also shall not go in thither.
\[38]But Joshua the son of Nun, which stands before you, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
\[39]Moreover your little ones, which you said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
\[40]But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
\[41]Then you answered and said to me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us.  And when you had girded on every man his weapons of war, you were ready to go up into the hill.
\[42]And the LORD said to me, Say to them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest you be smitten before your enemies.
\[43]So I spoke to you; and you would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.
\[44]And the Amorites, which dwelled in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even to Hormah.
\[45]And you returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not listen to your voice, nor give ear to you.
\[46]So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you stayed there.

hen we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spoke to me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.
\[2]And the LORD spoke to me, saying,
\[3]You have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
\[4]And command you the people, saying, You are to pass through the coast of your brothers the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take you good heed to yourselves therefore:
\[5]Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir to Esau for a possession.
\[6]You shall buy meat of them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.
\[7]For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the works of your hand: he knows your walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.
\[8]And when we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau, which dwelled in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
\[9]And the LORD said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give you of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.
\[10]The Emims dwelled therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;
\[11]Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.
\[12]The Horims also dwelled in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelled in their stead; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which the LORD gave to them.
\[13]Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.
\[14]And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD swore to them.
\[15]For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.
\[16]So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
\[17]That the LORD spoke to me, saying,
\[18]You are to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:
\[19]And when you come near over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.
\[20](That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelled therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;
\[21]A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelled in their stead:
\[22]As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelled in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelled in their stead even to this day:
\[23]And the Avims which dwelled in Hazerim, even to Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelled in their stead.)
\[24]Rise you up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.
\[25]This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you.
\[26]And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
\[27]Let me pass through your land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn to the right hand nor to the left.
\[28]You shall sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;
\[29](As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did to me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God gives us.
\[30]But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as appears this day.
\[31]And the LORD said to me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before you: begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.
\[32]Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.
\[33]And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.
\[34]And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:
\[35]Only the cattle we took for a prey to ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.
\[36]From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even to Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all to us:
\[37]Only to the land of the children of Ammon you came not, nor to any place of the river Jabbok, nor to the cities in the mountains, nor to whatever the LORD our God forbade us.

hen we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
\[2]And the LORD said to me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into your hand; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelled at Heshbon.
\[3]So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.
\[4]And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, three score cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\[5]All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.
\[6]And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.
\[7]But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.
\[8]And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon to mount Hermon;
\[9](Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)
\[10]All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\[11]For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.
\[12]And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
\[13]And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.
\[14]Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob to the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, to this day.
\[15]And I gave Gilead to Machir.
\[16]And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;
\[17]The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.
\[18]And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it: you shall pass over armed before your brothers the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.
\[19]But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that you have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;
\[20]Until the LORD have given rest to your brothers, as well as to you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God has given them beyond Jordan: and then shall you return every man to his possession, which I have given you.
\[21]And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings: so shall the LORD do to all the kingdoms where you pass.
\[22]You shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.
\[23]And I sought the LORD at that time, saying,
\[24]O Lord GOD, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to your works, and according to your might?
\[25]I pray you, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
\[26]But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said to me, Let it suffice you; speak no more to me of this matter.
\[27]Get you up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with your eyes: for you shall not go over this Jordan.
\[28]But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.
\[29]So we stayed in the valley over against Bethpeor.

ow therefore listen, O Israel, to the statutes and to the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that you may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers gives you.
\[2]You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish ought from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.
\[3]Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD your God has destroyed them from among you.
\[4]But you that did join to the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.
\[5]Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that you should do so in the land where you go to possess it.
\[6]Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
\[7]For what nation is there so great, who has God so near to them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call on him for?
\[8]And what nation is there so great, that has statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
\[9]Only take heed to yourself, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life: but teach them your sons, and your sons' sons;
\[10]Specially the day that you stood before the LORD your God in Horeb, when the LORD said to me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.
\[11]And you came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the middle of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.
\[12]And the LORD spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only you heard a voice.
\[13]And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them on two tables of stone.
\[14]And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it.
\[15]Take you therefore good heed to yourselves; for you saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spoke to you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire:
\[16]Lest you corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
\[17]The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flies in the air,
\[18]The likeness of any thing that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:
\[19]And lest you lift up your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, should be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD your God has divided to all nations under the whole heaven.
\[20]But the LORD has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as you are this day.
\[21]Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance:
\[22]But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but you shall go over, and possess that good land.
\[23]Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD your God has forbidden you.
\[24]For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.
\[25]When you shall beget children, and children's children, and you shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD your God, to provoke him to anger:
\[26]I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto you go over Jordan to possess it; you shall not prolong your days on it, but shall utterly be destroyed.
\[27]And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and you shall be left few in number among the heathen, where the LORD shall lead you.
\[28]And there you shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
\[29]But if from there you shall seek the LORD your God, you shall find him, if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul.
\[30]When you are in tribulation, and all these things are come on you, even in the latter days, if you turn to the LORD your God, and shall be obedient to his voice;
\[31](For the LORD your God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore to them.
\[32]For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven to the other, whether there has been any such thing as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?
\[33]Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have heard, and live?
\[34]Or has God assayed to go and take him a nation from the middle of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
\[35]To you it was showed, that you might know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him.
\[36]Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you: and on earth he showed you his great fire; and you heard his words out of the middle of the fire.
\[37]And because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought you out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;
\[38]To drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you are, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.
\[39]Know therefore this day, and consider it in your heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and on the earth beneath: there is none else.
\[40]You shall keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days on the earth, which the LORD your God gives you, for ever.
\[41]Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sun rise;
\[42]That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live:
\[43]Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.
\[44]And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:
\[45]These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt.
\[46]On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelled at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt:
\[47]And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sun rise;
\[48]From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even to mount Sion, which is Hermon,
\[49]And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.

nd Moses called all Israel, and said to them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that you may learn them, and keep, and do them.
\[2]The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
\[3]The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.
\[4]The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the middle of the fire,
\[5](I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to show you the word of the LORD: for you were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,
\[6]I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
\[7]You shall have none other gods before me.
\[8]You shall not make you any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:
\[9]You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,
\[10]And showing mercy to thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
\[11]You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.
\[12]Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD your God has commanded you.
\[13]Six days you shall labor, and do all your work:
\[14]But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your ox, nor your ass, nor any of your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates; that your manservant and your maidservant may rest as well as you.
\[15]And remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD your God brought you out there through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day.
\[16]Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you; that your days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with you, in the land which the LORD your God gives you.
\[17]You shall not kill.
\[18]Neither shall you commit adultery.
\[19]Neither shall you steal.
\[20]Neither shall you bear false witness against your neighbor.
\[21]Neither shall you desire your neighbor's wife, neither shall you covet your neighbor's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is your neighbor's.
\[22]These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly in the mount out of the middle of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them to me.
\[23]And it came to pass, when you heard the voice out of the middle of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
\[24]And you said, Behold, the LORD our God has showed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the middle of the fire: we have seen this day that God does talk with man, and he lives.
\[25]Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.
\[26]For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as we have, and lived?
\[27]Go you near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak you to us all that the LORD our God shall speak to you; and we will hear it, and do it.
\[28]And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when you spoke to me; and the LORD said to me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you: they have well said all that they have spoken.
\[29]O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!
\[30]Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.
\[31]But as for you, stand you here by me, and I will speak to you all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.
\[32]You shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God has commanded you: you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
\[33]You shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.

\[2]That you might fear the LORD your God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, you, and your son, and your son's son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged.
\[3]Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you, in the land that flows with milk and honey.
\[4]Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:
\[5]And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.
\[6]And these words, which I command you this day, shall be in your heart:
\[7]And you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.
\[8]And you shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
\[9]And you shall write them on the posts of your house, and on your gates.
\[10]And it shall be, when the LORD your God shall have brought you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you great and goodly cities, which you built not,
\[11]And houses full of all good things, which you filled not, and wells dig, which you digged not, vineyards and olive trees, which you planted not; when you shall have eaten and be full;
\[12]Then beware lest you forget the LORD, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
\[13]You shall fear the LORD your God, and serve him, and shall swear by his name.
\[14]You shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you;
\[15](For the LORD your God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD your God be kindled against you, and destroy you from off the face of the earth.
\[16]You shall not tempt the LORD your God, as you tempted him in Massah.
\[17]You shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you.
\[18]And you shall do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore to your fathers.
\[19]To cast out all your enemies from before you, as the LORD has spoken.
\[20]And when your son asks you in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God has commanded you?
\[21]Then you shall say to your son, We were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:
\[22]And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and sore, on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his household, before our eyes:
\[23]And he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.
\[24]And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.
\[25]And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he has commanded us.

\[2]And when the LORD your God shall deliver them before you; you shall smite them, and utterly destroy them; you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them:
\[3]Neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you shall not give to his son, nor his daughter shall you take to your son.
\[4]For they will turn away your son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy you suddenly.
\[5]But thus shall you deal with them; you shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.
\[6]For you are an holy people to the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people to himself, above all people that are on the face of the earth.
\[7]The LORD did not set his love on you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all people:
\[8]But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn to your fathers, has the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of slaves, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
\[9]Know therefore that the LORD your God, he is God, the faithful God, which keeps covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;
\[10]And repays them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hates him, he will repay him to his face.
\[11]You shall therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command you this day, to do them.
\[12]Why it shall come to pass, if you listen to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD your God shall keep to you the covenant and the mercy which he swore to your fathers:
\[13]And he will love you, and bless you, and multiply you: he will also bless the fruit of your womb, and the fruit of your land, your corn, and your wine, and your oil, the increase of your cows, and the flocks of your sheep, in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you.
\[14]You shall be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.
\[15]And the LORD will take away from you all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, on you; but will lay them on all them that hate you.
\[16]And you shall consume all the people which the LORD your God shall deliver you; your eye shall have no pity on them: neither shall you serve their gods; for that will be a snare to you.
\[17]If you shall say in your heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?
\[18]You shall not be afraid of them: but shall well remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt;
\[19]The great temptations which your eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD your God brought you out: so shall the LORD your God do to all the people of whom you are afraid.
\[20]Moreover the LORD your God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from you, be destroyed.
\[21]You shall not be affrighted at them: for the LORD your God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.
\[22]And the LORD your God will put out those nations before you by little and little: you may not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase on you.
\[23]But the LORD your God shall deliver them to you, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.
\[24]And he shall deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before you, until you have destroyed them.
\[25]The graven images of their gods shall you burn with fire: you shall not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it to you, lest you be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the LORD your God.
\[26]Neither shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be a cursed thing like it: but you shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.

\[2]And you shall remember all the way which the LORD your God led you these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you, and to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or no.
\[3]And he humbled you, and suffered you to hunger, and fed you with manna, which you knew not, neither did your fathers know; that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD does man live.
\[4]Your raiment waxed not old on you, neither did your foot swell, these forty years.
\[5]You shall also consider in your heart, that, as a man chastens his son, so the LORD your God chastens you.
\[6]Therefore you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
\[7]For the LORD your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;
\[8]A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;
\[9]A land wherein you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig brass.
\[10]When you have eaten and are full, then you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which he has given you.
\[11]Beware that you forget not the LORD your God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command you this day:
\[12]Lest when you have eaten and are full, and have built goodly houses, and dwelled therein;
\[13]And when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied;
\[14]Then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;
\[15]Who led you through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought you forth water out of the rock of flint;
\[16]Who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers knew not, that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end;
\[17]And you say in your heart, My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.
\[18]But you shall remember the LORD your God: for it is he that gives you power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as it is this day.
\[19]And it shall be, if you do at all forget the LORD your God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish.

ear, O Israel: You are to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,
\[2]A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak!
\[3]Understand therefore this day, that the LORD your God is he which goes over before you; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before your face: so shall you drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD has said to you.
\[4]Speak not you in your heart, after that the LORD your God has cast them out from before you, saying, For my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD does drive them out from before you.
\[5]Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart, do you go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD your God does drive them out from before you, and that he may perform the word which the LORD swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
\[6]Understand therefore, that the LORD your God gives you not this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stiff necked people.
\[7]Remember, and forget not, how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you did depart out of the land of Egypt, until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the LORD.
\[8]Also in Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.
\[9]When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I stayed in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:
\[10]And the LORD delivered to me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spoke with you in the mount out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly.
\[11]And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.
\[12]And the LORD said to me, Arise, get you down quickly from hence; for your people which you have brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.
\[13]Furthermore the LORD spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff necked people:
\[14]Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.
\[15]So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.
\[16]And I looked, and, behold, you had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: you had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.
\[17]And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.
\[18]And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which you sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
\[19]For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, with which the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD listened to me at that time also.
\[20]And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.
\[21]And I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.
\[22]And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, you provoked the LORD to wrath.
\[23]Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then you rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and you believed him not, nor listened to his voice.
\[24]You have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.
\[25]Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.
\[26]I prayed therefore to the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not your people and your inheritance, which you have redeemed through your greatness, which you have brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
\[27]Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:
\[28]Lest the land from where you brought us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
\[29]Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your mighty power and by your stretched out arm.

\[3]And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like to the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand.
\[4]And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spoke to you in the mount out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them to me.
\[5]And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.
\[6]And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.
\[7]From there they journeyed to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.
\[8]At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.
\[9]Why Levi has no part nor inheritance with his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD your God promised him.
\[10]And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD listened to me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy you.
\[11]And the LORD said to me, Arise, take your journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them.
\[12]And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
\[13]To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command you this day for your good?
\[14]Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's your God, the earth also, with all that therein is.
\[15]Only the LORD had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.
\[16]Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff necked.
\[17]For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regards not persons, nor takes reward:
\[18]He does execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loves the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.
\[19]Love you therefore the stranger: for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.
\[20]You shall fear the LORD your God; him shall you serve, and to him shall you hold, and swear by his name.
\[21]He is your praise, and he is your God, that has done for you these great and terrible things, which your eyes have seen.

\[3]And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the middle of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land;

\[5]And what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came into this place;
\[6]And what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the middle of all Israel:

\[9]And that you may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed, a land that flows with milk and honey.
\[10]For the land, where you go in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from from where you came out, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs:
\[11]But the land, where you go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinks water of the rain of heaven:
\[12]A land which the LORD your God cares for: the eyes of the LORD your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.

\[15]And I will send grass in your fields for your cattle, that you may eat and be full.
\[16]Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
\[17]And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest you perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD gives you.
\[18]Therefore shall you lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign on your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.
\[19]And you shall teach them your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.
\[20]And you shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates:
\[21]That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven on the earth.
\[22]For if you shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to join to him;
\[23]Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.
\[24]Every place where on the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the uttermost sea shall your coast be.
\[25]There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread on, as he has said to you.
\[26]Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;

\[2]You shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which you shall possess served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree:
\[3]And you shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and you shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.
\[4]You shall not do so to the LORD your God.
\[5]But to the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even to his habitation shall you seek, and thither you shall come:
\[6]And thither you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and of your flocks:
\[7]And there you shall eat before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, wherein the LORD your God has blessed you.
\[8]You shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatever is right in his own eyes.
\[9]For you are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God gives you.
\[10]But when you go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God gives you to inherit, and when he gives you rest from all your enemies round about, so that you dwell in safety;
\[11]Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall you bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to the LORD:
\[12]And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; for as much as he has no part nor inheritance with you.
\[13]Take heed to yourself that you offer not your burnt offerings in every place that you see:
\[14]But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.
\[15]Notwithstanding you may kill and eat flesh in all your gates, whatever your soul lusts after, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which he has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.
\[16]Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it on the earth as water.
\[17]You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your corn, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herds or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your freewill offerings, or heave offering of your hand:
\[18]But you must eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God shall choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates: and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all that you put your hands to.
\[19]Take heed to yourself that you forsake not the Levite as long as you live on the earth.
\[20]When the LORD your God shall enlarge your border, as he has promised you, and you shall say, I will eat flesh, because your soul longs to eat flesh; you may eat flesh, whatever your soul lusts after.
\[21]If the place which the LORD your God has chosen to put his name there be too far from you, then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock, which the LORD has given you, as I have commanded you, and you shall eat in your gates whatever your soul lusts after.
\[22]Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so you shall eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.
\[23]Only be sure that you eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and you may not eat the life with the flesh.
\[24]You shall not eat it; you shall pour it on the earth as water.
\[25]You shall not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, when you shall do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.
\[26]Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take, and go to the place which the LORD shall choose:
\[27]And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of the LORD your God: and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of the LORD your God, and you shall eat the flesh.
\[28]Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you for ever, when you do that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God.
\[29]When the LORD your God shall cut off the nations from before you, where you go to possess them, and you succeed them, and dwell in their land;
\[30]Take heed to yourself that you be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before you; and that you inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.
\[31]You shall not do so to the LORD your God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hates, have they done to their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.
\[32]What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: you shall not add thereto, nor diminish from it.

\[3]And shall say to them, Hear, O Israel, you approach this day to battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be you terrified because of them;
\[4]For the LORD your God is he that goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.
\[5]And the officers shall speak to the people, saying, What man is there that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.
\[6]And what man is he that has planted a vineyard, and has not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.

\[12]And if it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it:

\[14]But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shall you take to yourself; and you shall eat the spoil of your enemies, which the LORD your God has given you.
\[15]Thus shall you do to all the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.

\[17]But you shall utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD your God has commanded you:
\[18]That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done to their gods; so should you sin against the LORD your God.
\[19]When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an ax against them: for you may eat of them, and you shall not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:
\[20]Only the trees which you know that they be not trees for meat, you shall destroy and cut them down; and you shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it be subdued.

\[17]But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he has: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.
\[18]If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not listen to them:
\[19]Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate of his place;

\[9]The LORD shall establish you an holy people to himself, as he has sworn to you, if you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and walk in his ways.
\[10]And all people of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of you.
\[11]And the LORD shall make you plenteous in goods, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your cattle, and in the fruit of your ground, in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give you.
\[12]The LORD shall open to you his good treasure, the heaven to give the rain to your land in his season, and to bless all the work of your hand: and you shall lend to many nations, and you shall not borrow.
\[13]And the LORD shall make you the head, and not the tail; and you shall be above only, and you shall not be beneath; if that you listen to the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day, to observe and to do them:
\[14]And you shall not go aside from any of the words which I command you this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
\[15]But it shall come to pass, if you will not listen to the voice of the LORD your God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day; that all these curses shall come on you, and overtake you:
\[16]Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be in the field.
\[17]Cursed shall be your basket and your store.
\[18]Cursed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your land, the increase of your cows, and the flocks of your sheep.
\[19]Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you be when you go out.
\[20]The LORD shall send on you cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all that you set your hand to for to do, until you be destroyed, and until you perish quickly; because of the wickedness of your doings, whereby you have forsaken me.
\[21]The LORD shall make the pestilence stick to you, until he have consumed you from off the land, where you go to possess it.
\[22]The LORD shall smite you with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue you until you perish.
\[23]And your heaven that is over your head shall be brass, and the earth that is under you shall be iron.
\[24]The LORD shall make the rain of your land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down on you, until you be destroyed.
\[25]The LORD shall cause you to be smitten before your enemies: you shall go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shall be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.
\[26]And your carcass shall be meat to all fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.
\[27]The LORD will smite you with the botch of Egypt, and with the tumors, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof you can not be healed.
\[28]The LORD shall smite you with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart:
\[29]And you shall grope at noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways: and you shall be only oppressed and spoiled ever more, and no man shall save you.
\[30]You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: you shall build an house, and you shall not dwell therein: you shall plant a vineyard, and shall not gather the grapes thereof.
\[31]Your ox shall be slain before your eyes, and you shall not eat thereof: your ass shall be violently taken away from before your face, and shall not be restored to you: your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and you shall have none to rescue them.
\[32]Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people, and your eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long; and there shall be no might in your hand.
\[33]The fruit of your land, and all your labors, shall a nation which you know not eat up; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed always:
\[34]So that you shall be mad for the sight of your eyes which you shall see.
\[35]The LORD shall smite you in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot to the top of your head.
\[36]The LORD shall bring you, and your king which you shall set over you, to a nation which neither you nor your fathers have known; and there shall you serve other gods, wood and stone.
\[37]And you shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations where the LORD shall lead you.
\[38]You shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.
\[39]You shall plant vineyards, and dress them, but shall neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.
\[40]You shall have olive trees throughout all your coasts, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olive shall cast his fruit.
\[41]You shall beget sons and daughters, but you shall not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity.
\[42]All your trees and fruit of your land shall the locust consume.
\[43]The stranger that is within you shall get up above you very high; and you shall come down very low.
\[44]He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him: he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.
\[45]Moreover all these curses shall come on you, and shall pursue you, and overtake you, till you be destroyed; because you listened not to the voice of the LORD your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you:
\[46]And they shall be on you for a sign and for a wonder, and on your seed for ever.
\[47]Because you served not the LORD your God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;
\[48]Therefore shall you serve your enemies which the LORD shall send against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron on your neck, until he have destroyed you.
\[49]The LORD shall bring a nation against you from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flies; a nation whose tongue you shall not understand;
\[50]A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young:
\[51]And he shall eat the fruit of your cattle, and the fruit of your land, until you be destroyed: which also shall not leave you either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of your cows, or flocks of your sheep, until he have destroyed you.
\[52]And he shall besiege you in all your gates, until your high and fenced walls come down, wherein you trusted, throughout all your land: and he shall besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land, which the LORD your God has given you.
\[53]And you shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, which the LORD your God has given you, in the siege, and in the narrow place, with which your enemies shall distress you:
\[54]So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:
\[55]So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he has nothing left him in the siege, and in the narrow place, with which your enemies shall distress you in all your gates.
\[56]The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,
\[57]And toward her young one that comes out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and narrow place, with which your enemy shall distress you in your gates.
\[58]If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;
\[59]Then the LORD will make your plagues wonderful, and the plagues of your seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.
\[60]Moreover he will bring on you all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they shall stick to you.
\[61]Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring on you, until you be destroyed.
\[62]And you shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God.
\[63]And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nothing; and you shall be plucked from off the land where you go to possess it.
\[64]And the LORD shall scatter you among all people, from the one end of the earth even to the other; and there you shall serve other gods, which neither you nor your fathers have known, even wood and stone.
\[65]And among these nations shall you find no ease, neither shall the sole of your foot have rest: but the LORD shall give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:
\[66]And your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall fear day and night, and shall have none assurance of your life:
\[67]In the morning you shall say, Would God it were even! and at even you shall say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of your heart with which you shall fear, and for the sight of your eyes which you shall see.
\[68]And the LORD shall bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spoke to you, You shall see it no more again: and there you shall be sold to your enemies for slaves and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.

hese are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.
\[2]And Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, You have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;
\[3]The great temptations which your eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles:
\[4]Yet the LORD has not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.
\[5]And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old on you, and your shoe is not waxen old on your foot.
\[6]You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink: that you might know that I am the LORD your God.
\[7]And when you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us to battle, and we smote them:
\[8]And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.
\[9]Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.
\[10]You stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel,
\[11]Your little ones, your wives, and your stranger that is in your camp, from the hewer of your wood to the drawer of your water:
\[12]That you should enter into covenant with the LORD your God, and into his oath, which the LORD your God makes with you this day:
\[13]That he may establish you to day for a people to himself, and that he may be to you a God, as he has said to you, and as he has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
\[14]Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;
\[15]But with him that stands here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:
\[16](For you know how we have dwelled in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which you passed by;
\[17]And you have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)
\[18]Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;
\[19]And it come to pass, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:
\[20]The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie on him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.
\[21]And the LORD shall separate him to evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law:
\[22]So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD has laid on it;
\[23]And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:
\[24]Even all nations shall say, Why has the LORD done thus to this land? what means the heat of this great anger?
\[25]Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:
\[26]For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given to them:
\[27]And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring on it all the curses that are written in this book:
\[28]And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.
\[29]The secret things belong to the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong to us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.

\[2]And shall return to the LORD your God, and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day, you and your children, with all your heart, and with all your soul;
\[3]That then the LORD your God will turn your captivity, and have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the nations, where the LORD your God has scattered you.
\[4]If any of your be driven out to the outmost parts of heaven, from there will the LORD your God gather you, and from there will he fetch you:
\[5]And the LORD your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and he will do you good, and multiply you above your fathers.
\[6]And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.
\[7]And the LORD your God will put all these curses on your enemies, and on them that hate you, which persecuted you.
\[8]And you shall return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all his commandments which I command you this day.
\[9]And the LORD your God will make you plenteous in every work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your cattle, and in the fruit of your land, for good: for the LORD will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced over your fathers:
\[10]If you shall listen to the voice of the LORD your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, and if you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.
\[11]For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not hidden from you, neither is it far off.
\[12]It is not in heaven, that you should say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it?
\[13]Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it?
\[14]But the word is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it.
\[15]See, I have set before you this day life and good, and death and evil;
\[16]In that I command you this day to love the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that you may live and multiply: and the LORD your God shall bless you in the land where you go to possess it.
\[17]But if your heart turn away, so that you will not hear, but shall be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
\[18]I denounce to you this day, that you shall surely perish, and that you shall not prolong your days on the land, where you pass over Jordan to go to possess it.
\[19]I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both you and your seed may live:
\[20]That you may love the LORD your God, and that you may obey his voice, and that you may hold to him: for he is your life, and the length of your days: that you may dwell in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

nd Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
\[2]And he said to them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD has said to me, You shall not go over this Jordan.
\[3]The LORD your God, he will go over before you, and he will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before you, as the LORD has said.
\[4]And the LORD shall do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and to the land of them, whom he destroyed.
\[5]And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that you may do to them according to all the commandments which I have commanded you.
\[6]Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD your God, he it is that does go with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you.
\[7]And Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for you must go with this people to the land which the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it.
\[8]And the LORD, he it is that does go before you; he will be with you, he will not fail you, neither forsake you: fear not, neither be dismayed.
\[9]And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, which bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.
\[10]And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,
\[11]When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD your God in the place which he shall choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
\[12]Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and your stranger that is within your gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:
\[13]And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as you live in the land where you go over Jordan to possess it.
\[14]And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, your days approach that you must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[15]And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.
\[16]And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
\[17]Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come on us, because our God is not among us?
\[18]And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have worked, in that they are turned to other gods.
\[19]Now therefore write you this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
\[20]For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, that flows with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.
\[21]And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.
\[22]Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
\[23]And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with you.
\[24]And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
\[25]That Moses commanded the Levites, which bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,
\[26]Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.
\[27]For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?
\[28]Gather to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.
\[29]For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.
\[30]And Moses spoke in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.

\[2]My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain on the tender herb, and as the showers on the grass:
\[3]Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe you greatness to our God.
\[4]He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.
\[5]They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.
\[6]Do you thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he your father that has bought you? has he not made you, and established you?
\[7]Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you.
\[8]When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.
\[9]For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.
\[10]He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.
\[11]As an eagle stirs up her nest, flutters over her young, spreads abroad her wings, takes them, bears them on her wings:
\[12]So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.
\[13]He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;
\[14]Butter of cows, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and you did drink the pure blood of the grape.
\[15]But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
\[16]They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.
\[17]They sacrificed to devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.
\[18]Of the Rock that begat you you are unmindful, and have forgotten God that formed you.
\[19]And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.
\[20]And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very fraudulent generation, children in whom is no faith.
\[21]They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
\[22]For a fire is kindled in my anger, and shall burn to the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
\[23]I will heap mischiefs on them; I will spend my arrows on them.
\[24]They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts on them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.
\[25]The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.
\[26]I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:
\[27]Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD has not done all this.
\[28]For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.
\[29]O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!
\[30]How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?
\[31]For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.
\[32]For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:
\[33]Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.
\[34]Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?
\[35]To me belongs vengeance and recompense; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come on them make haste.
\[36]For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.
\[37]And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,
\[38]Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.
\[39]See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.
\[40]For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.
\[41]If I whet my glittering sword, and my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my enemies, and will reward them that hate me.
\[42]I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges on the enemy.
\[43]Rejoice, O you nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, and to his people.
\[44]And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.
\[45]And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:

\[47]For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over Jordan to possess it.
\[48]And the LORD spoke to Moses that selfsame day, saying,
\[49]Get you up into this mountain Abarim, to mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession:
\[50]And die in the mount where you go up, and be gathered to your people; as Aaron your brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his people:
\[51]Because you trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you sanctified me not in the middle of the children of Israel.

\[6]Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.
\[7]And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him to his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be you an help to him from his enemies.
\[8]And of Levi he said, Let your Thummim and your Urim be with your holy one, whom you did prove at Massah, and with whom you did strive at the waters of Meribah;
\[9]Who said to his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brothers, nor knew his own children: for they have observed your word, and kept your covenant.
\[10]They shall teach Jacob your judgments, and Israel your law: they shall put incense before you, and whole burnt sacrifice on your altar.
\[11]Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.
\[12]And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.
\[13]And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,
\[14]And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,
\[15]And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,
\[16]And for the precious things of the earth and fullness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelled in the bush: let the blessing come on the head of Joseph, and on the top of the head of him that was separated from his brothers.
\[17]His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.
\[18]And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and, Issachar, in your tents.
\[19]They shall call the people to the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.
\[20]And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlarges Gad: he dwells as a lion, and tears the arm with the crown of the head.
\[21]And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.
\[22]And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.
\[23]And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess you the west and the south.
\[24]And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brothers, and let him dip his foot in oil.
\[25]Your shoes shall be iron and brass; and as your days, so shall your strength be.
\[26]There is none like to the God of Jeshurun, who rides on the heaven in your help, and in his excellency on the sky.
\[27]The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before you; and shall say, Destroy them.
\[28]Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be on a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.
\[29]Happy are you, O Israel: who is like to you, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of your help, and who is the sword of your excellency! and your enemies shall be found liars to you; and you shall tread on their high places.

\[2]And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the utmost sea,
\[3]And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, to Zoar.
\[4]And the LORD said to him, This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give it to your seed: I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over thither.
\[5]So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.
\[6]And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knows of his sepulcher to this day.
\[7]And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
\[8]And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.
\[9]And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands on him: and the children of Israel listened to him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[10]And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like to Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,
\[11]In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
\[12]And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses showed in the sight of all Israel.

ow after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,
\[2]Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you, and all this people, to the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.
\[3]Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread on, that have I given to you, as I said to Moses.
\[4]From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.
\[5]There shall not any man be able to stand before you all the days of your life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with you: I will not fail you, nor forsake you.
\[6]Be strong and of a good courage: for to this people shall you divide for an inheritance the land, which I swore to their fathers to give them.
\[7]Only be you strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded you: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go.
\[8]This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth; but you shall meditate therein day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.
\[9]Have not I commanded you? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be you dismayed: for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.
\[10]Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
\[11]Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days you shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God gives you to possess it.
\[12]And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spoke Joshua, saying,
\[13]Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God has given you rest, and has given you this land.
\[14]Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but you shall pass before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them;
\[15]Until the LORD have given your brothers rest, as he has given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God gives them: then you shall return to the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sun rise.
\[16]And they answered Joshua, saying, All that you command us we will do, and wherever you send us, we will go.
\[17]According as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you: only the LORD your God be with you, as he was with Moses.
\[18]Whoever he be that does rebel against your commandment, and will not listen to your words in all that you command him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.

nd Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.
\[2]And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in here to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.
\[3]And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to you, which are entered into your house: for they be come to search out all the country.
\[4]And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men to me, but I knew not from where they were:
\[5]And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: where the men went I know not: pursue after them quickly; for you shall overtake them.
\[6]But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.
\[7]And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan to the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.
\[8]And before they were laid down, she came up to them on the roof;
\[9]And she said to the men, I know that the LORD has given you the land, and that your terror is fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.
\[10]For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.
\[11]And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.
\[12]Now therefore, I pray you, swear to me by the LORD, since I have showed you kindness, that you will also show kindness to my father's house, and give me a true token:
\[13]And that you will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.
\[14]And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if you utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD has given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.
\[15]Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was on the town wall, and she dwelled on the wall.
\[16]And she said to them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may you go your way.
\[17]And the men said to her, We will be blameless of this your oath which you have made us swear.
\[18]Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you did let us down by: and you shall bring your father, and your mother, and your brothers, and all your father's household, home to you.
\[19]And it shall be, that whoever shall go out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be on his head, and we will be guiltless: and whoever shall be with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be on him.
\[20]And if you utter this our business, then we will be quit of your oath which you have made us to swear.
\[21]And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
\[22]And they went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.
\[23]So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:
\[24]And they said to Joshua, Truly the LORD has delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.

\[2]And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;
\[3]And they commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall remove from your place, and go after it.
\[4]Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near to it, that you may know the way by which you must go: for you have not passed this way heretofore.
\[5]And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.
\[6]And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
\[7]And the LORD said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.
\[8]And you shall command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When you are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, you shall stand still in Jordan.
\[9]And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come here, and hear the words of the LORD your God.
\[10]And Joshua said, Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.
\[11]Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth passes over before you into Jordan.
\[12]Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.
\[13]And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand on an heap.
\[14]And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;
\[15]And as they that bore the ark were come to Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overflows all his banks all the time of harvest,)
\[16]That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up on an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.
\[17]And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.

\[3]And command you them, saying, Take you hence out of the middle of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and you shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where you shall lodge this night.
\[4]Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:
\[5]And Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:
\[6]That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean you by these stones?
\[7]Then you shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel for ever.
\[8]And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of Jordan, as the LORD spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.
\[9]And Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bore the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there to this day.
\[10]For the priests which bore the ark stood in the middle of Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hurried and passed over.
\[11]And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.
\[12]And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke to them:
\[13]About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD to battle, to the plains of Jericho.
\[14]On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
\[15]And the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,
\[16]Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.
\[17]Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come you up out of Jordan.
\[18]And it came to pass, when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the middle of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned to their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did before.
\[19]And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.
\[20]And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.
\[21]And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?
\[22]Then you shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
\[23]For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until you were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:

\[2]At that time the LORD said to Joshua, Make you sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.
\[3]And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
\[4]And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
\[5]Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.
\[6]For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: to whom the LORD swore that he would not show them the land, which the LORD swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land that flows with milk and honey.
\[7]And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.
\[8]And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they stayed in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
\[9]And the LORD said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Why the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.
\[10]And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.
\[11]And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.
\[12]And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
\[13]And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?
\[14]And he said, No; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said to him, What said my Lord to his servant?

ow Jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.
\[2]And the LORD said to Joshua, See, I have given into your hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valor.
\[3]And you shall compass the city, all you men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shall you do six days.
\[4]And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day you shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.
\[5]And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.
\[6]And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.
\[7]And he said to the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.
\[8]And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.
\[9]And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
\[10]And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, You shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall you shout.
\[11]So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.
\[12]And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.
\[13]And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
\[14]And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.
\[15]And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.
\[16]And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout; for the LORD has given you the city.
\[17]And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
\[18]And you, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest you make yourselves accursed, when you take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.
\[19]But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated to the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.
\[20]So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.
\[21]And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.
\[22]But Joshua had said to the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out there the woman, and all that she has, as you swore to her.
\[23]And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brothers, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.
\[24]And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.
\[25]And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwells in Israel even to this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
\[26]And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that rises up and builds this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.

\[2]And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and view the country.  And the men went up and viewed Ai.
\[3]And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labor thither; for they are but few.
\[4]So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.
\[5]And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: why the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.
\[6]And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust on their heads.
\[7]And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, why have you at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelled on the other side Jordan!
\[8]O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turns their backs before their enemies!
\[9]For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what will you do to your great name?
\[10]And the LORD said to Joshua, Get you up; why lie you thus on your face?
\[11]Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.
\[12]Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except you destroy the accursed from among you.
\[13]Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus said the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the middle of you, O Israel: you can not stand before your enemies, until you take away the accursed thing from among you.
\[14]In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD takes shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.
\[15]And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has: because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has worked folly in Israel.
\[16]So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:
\[17]And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:
\[18]And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
\[19]And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me.
\[20]And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
\[21]When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the middle of my tent, and the silver under it.
\[22]So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
\[23]And they took them out of the middle of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.
\[24]And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them to the valley of Achor.
\[25]And Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? the LORD shall trouble you this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.
\[26]And they raised over him a great heap of stones to this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Why the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, to this day.

nd the LORD said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be you dismayed: take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:
\[2]And you shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall you take for a prey to yourselves: lay you an ambush for the city behind it.
\[3]So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night.
\[4]And he commanded them, saying, Behold, you shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be you all ready:
\[5]And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach to the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,
\[6](For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.
\[7]Then you shall rise up from the ambush, and seize on the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.
\[8]And it shall be, when you have taken the city, that you shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall you do. See, I have commanded you.
\[9]Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
\[10]And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
\[11]And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.
\[12]And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.
\[13]And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the middle of the valley.
\[14]And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he knew not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.
\[15]And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
\[16]And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
\[17]And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.
\[18]And the LORD said to Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.
\[19]And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hurried and set the city on fire.
\[20]And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.
\[21]And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.
\[22]And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the middle of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
\[23]And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
\[24]And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
\[25]And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.
\[26]For Joshua drew not his hand back, with which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
\[27]Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey to themselves, according to the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.
\[28]And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation to this day.
\[29]And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcass down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remains to this day.
\[30]Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,
\[31]As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man has lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.
\[32]And he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.
\[33]And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.
\[34]And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
\[35]There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.

nd it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;
\[2]That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
\[3]And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
\[4]They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;
\[5]And old shoes and clouted on their feet, and old garments on them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and moldy.
\[6]And they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make you a league with us.
\[7]And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, Peradventure you dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?
\[8]And they said to Joshua, We are your servants. And Joshua said to them, Who are you? and from from where come you?
\[9]And they said to him, From a very far country your servants are come because of the name of the LORD your God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
\[10]And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.
\[11]Why our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, We are your servants: therefore now make you a league with us.
\[12]This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is moldy:
\[13]And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.
\[14]And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.
\[15]And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation swore to them.
\[16]And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelled among them.
\[17]And the children of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.
\[18]And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.
\[19]But all the princes said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.
\[20]This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be on us, because of the oath which we swore to them.
\[21]And the princes said to them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water to all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.
\[22]And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have you beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when you dwell among us?
\[23]Now therefore you are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being slaves, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.
\[24]And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told your servants, how that the LORD your God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
\[25]And now, behold, we are in your hand: as it seems good and right to you to do to us, do.
\[26]And so did he to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.
\[27]And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even to this day, in the place which he should choose.

ow it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;
\[2]That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.
\[3]Why Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
\[4]Come up to me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
\[5]Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.
\[6]And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not your hand from your servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.
\[7]So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
\[8]And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into your hand; there shall not a man of them stand before you.
\[9]Joshua therefore came to them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night.
\[10]And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goes up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and to Makkedah.
\[11]And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven on them to Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.
\[12]Then spoke Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand you still on Gibeon; and you, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.
\[13]And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves on their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the middle of heaven, and hurried not to go down about a whole day.
\[14]And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD listened to the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.
\[15]And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
\[16]But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
\[17]And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.
\[18]And Joshua said, Roll great stones on the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:
\[19]And stay you not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand.
\[20]And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.
\[21]And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
\[22]Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me out of the cave.
\[23]And they did so, and brought forth those five kings to him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
\[24]And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet on the necks of them.
\[25]And Joshua said to them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom you fight.
\[26]And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging on the trees until the evening.
\[27]And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.
\[28]And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho.
\[29]Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah:
\[30]And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did to the king thereof as he did to the king of Jericho.
\[31]And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:
\[32]And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
\[33]Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
\[34]And from Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:
\[35]And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
\[36]And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it:
\[37]And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.
\[38]And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:
\[39]And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.
\[40]So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.
\[41]And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.
\[42]And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.
\[43]And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.

nd it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
\[2]And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,
\[3]And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.
\[4]And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is on the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.
\[5]And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
\[6]And the LORD said to Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: you shall hamstring their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.
\[7]So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell on them.
\[8]And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them to great Zidon, and to Misrephothmaim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.
\[9]And Joshua did to them as the LORD bade him: he hamstrung their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.
\[10]And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.
\[11]And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.
\[12]And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.
\[13]But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
\[14]And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey to themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.
\[15]As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.
\[16]So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;
\[17]Even from the mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.
\[18]Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
\[19]There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.
\[20]For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[21]And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.
\[22]There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.
\[23]So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.

ow Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said to him, You are old and stricken in years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed.
\[2]This is the land that yet remains: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,
\[3]From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even to the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:
\[4]From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians to Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:
\[5]And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sun rise, from Baalgad under mount Hermon to the entering into Hamath.
\[6]All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide you it by lot to the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.
\[7]Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
\[8]With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;
\[9]From Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the river, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon;
\[10]And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;

\[12]All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out.
\[13]Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.
\[14]Only to the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said to them.
\[15]And Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families.
\[16]And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the river, and all the plain by Medeba;
\[17]Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,
\[18]And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
\[19]And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of the valley,
\[20]And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,
\[21]And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.
\[22]Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.

\[24]And Moses gave inheritance to the tribe of Gad, even to the children of Gad according to their families.
\[25]And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that is before Rabbah;

nd these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.
\[2]By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.
\[3]For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but to the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.
\[4]For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part to the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.
\[5]As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.
\[6]Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, You know the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Kadeshbarnea.
\[7]Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart.
\[8]Nevertheless my brothers that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.
\[9]And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land where on your feet have trodden shall be your inheritance, and your children's for ever, because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.
\[10]And now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, see, I am this day fourscore and five years old.
\[11]As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.
\[12]Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.
\[13]And Joshua blessed him, and gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.
\[14]Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite to this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.
\[15]And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.

\[4]From there it passed toward Azmon, and went out to the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.

\[8]And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:
\[9]And the border was drawn from the top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim:

\[11]And the border went out to the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out to Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.
\[12]And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof.  This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families.
\[13]And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.
\[14]And Caleb drove there the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
\[15]And he went up there to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.
\[16]And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjathsepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
\[17]And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
\[18]And it came to pass, as she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said to her, What would you?
\[19]Who answered, Give me a blessing; for you have given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.

here was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
\[2]There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.
\[3]But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
\[4]And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.
\[5]And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;
\[6]Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.
\[7]And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lies before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand to the inhabitants of Entappuah.
\[8]Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;
\[9]And the coast descended to the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:
\[10]Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.
\[11]And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.
\[12]Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
\[13]Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly drive them out.
\[14]And the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why have you given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, for as much as the LORD has blessed me till now?
\[15]And Joshua answered them, If you be a great people, then get you up to the wood country, and cut down for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for you.
\[16]And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.
\[17]And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, You are a great people, and have great power: you shall not have one lot only:
\[18]But the mountain shall be yours; for it is a wood, and you shall cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be yours: for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong.

\[3]And Joshua said to the children of Israel, How long are you slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers has given you?
\[4]Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to me.
\[5]And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north.
\[6]You shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the description here to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.
\[7]But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.
\[8]And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.
\[9]And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.
\[10]And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions.
\[11]And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.

\[13]And the border went over from there toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill that lies on the south side of the nether Bethhoron.
\[14]And the border was drawn there, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that lies before Bethhoron southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter.
\[15]And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah:
\[16]And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,
\[17]And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,
\[18]And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down to Arabah:
\[19]And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the south coast.

\[7]The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
\[8]And the children of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
\[9]And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name.
\[10]Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs was the first lot.
\[11]And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it.
\[12]But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
\[13]Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with her suburbs,
\[14]And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,
\[15]And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,
\[16]And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.
\[17]And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with her suburbs,
\[18]Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities.
\[19]All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
\[20]And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.
\[21]For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs,
\[22]And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs; four cities.
\[23]And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon with her suburbs,
\[24]Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathrimmon with her suburbs; four cities.
\[25]And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbs, and Gathrimmon with her suburbs; two cities.
\[26]All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of the children of Kohath that remained.
\[27]And to the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Beeshterah with her suburbs; two cities.
\[28]And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs, Dabareh with her suburbs,
\[29]Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannim with her suburbs; four cities.
\[30]And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon with her suburbs,
\[31]Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four cities.
\[32]And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.
\[33]All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
\[34]And to the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs,
\[35]Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four cities.
\[36]And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jahazah with her suburbs,
\[37]Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four cities.
\[38]And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with her suburbs,
\[39]Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in all.
\[40]So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities.
\[41]All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.
\[42]These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus were all these cities.
\[43]And the LORD gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelled therein.
\[44]And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that he swore to their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.
\[45]There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.

hen Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
\[2]And said to them, You have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:
\[3]You have not left your brothers these many days to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.
\[4]And now the LORD your God has given rest to your brothers, as he promised them: therefore now return you, and get you to your tents, and to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.
\[5]But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to hold to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.
\[6]So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went to their tents.
\[7]Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but to the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brothers on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also to their tents, then he blessed them,
\[8]And he spoke to them, saying, Return with much riches to your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.
\[9]And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
\[10]And when they came to the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.
\[11]And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.
\[12]And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.
\[13]And the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
\[14]And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.
\[15]And they came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,
\[16]Thus said the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that you have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that you have built you an altar, that you might rebel this day against the LORD?
\[17]Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,
\[18]But that you must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing you rebel to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.
\[19]Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass you over to the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwells, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God.
\[20]Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.
\[21]Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said to the heads of the thousands of Israel,
\[22]The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knows, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)
\[23]That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it;
\[24]And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak to our children, saying, What have you to do with the LORD God of Israel?
\[25]For the LORD has made Jordan a border between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad; you have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.
\[26]Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:
\[27]But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, You have no part in the LORD.
\[28]Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.
\[29]God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.
\[30]And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them.
\[31]And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because you have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now you have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.
\[32]And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
\[33]And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelled.
\[34]And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.

nd it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age.
\[2]And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said to them, I am old and stricken in age:
\[3]And you have seen all that the LORD your God has done to all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that has fought for you.
\[4]Behold, I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea westward.
\[5]And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and you shall possess their land, as the LORD your God has promised to you.
\[6]Be you therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that you turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;
\[7]That you come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves to them:
\[8]But hold to the LORD your God, as you have done to this day.
\[9]For the LORD has driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man has been able to stand before you to this day.
\[10]One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fights for you, as he has promised you.
\[11]Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that you love the LORD your God.
\[12]Else if you do in any wise go back, and join to the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you:
\[13]Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps to you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you.
\[14]And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing has failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spoke concerning you; all are come to pass to you, and not one thing has failed thereof.
\[15]Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come on you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring on you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you.
\[16]When you have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land which he has given to you.

nd Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
\[2]And Joshua said to all the people, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelled on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.
\[3]And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.
\[4]And I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
\[5]I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.
\[6]And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red sea.
\[7]And when they cried to the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea on them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and you dwelled in the wilderness a long season.
\[8]And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelled on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that you might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.
\[9]Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:
\[10]But I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.
\[11]And you went over Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.
\[12]And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with your sword, nor with your bow.
\[13]And I have given you a land for which you did not labor, and cities which you built not, and you dwell in them; of the vineyards and olive groves which you planted not do you eat.
\[14]Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve you the LORD.
\[15]And if it seem evil to you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.
\[16]And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;
\[17]For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:
\[18]And the LORD drove out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelled in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.
\[19]And Joshua said to the people, You cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.
\[20]If you forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he has done you good.
\[21]And the people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve the LORD.
\[22]And Joshua said to the people, You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.
\[23]Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart to the LORD God of Israel.
\[24]And the people said to Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.
\[25]So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
\[26]And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.
\[27]And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us; for it has heard all the words of the LORD which he spoke to us: it shall be therefore a witness to you, lest you deny your God.
\[28]So Joshua let the people depart, every man to his inheritance.
\[29]And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.
\[30]And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.
\[31]And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.
\[32]And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
\[33]And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.

ow after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
\[2]And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
\[3]And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot. So Simeon went with him.
\[4]And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.
\[5]And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
\[6]But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
\[7]And Adonibezek said, Three score and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.
\[8]Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
\[9]And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelled in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.
\[10]And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelled in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
\[11]And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:
\[12]And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjathsepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
\[13]And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
\[14]And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said to her, What will you?
\[15]And she said to him, Give me a blessing: for you have given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
\[16]And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.
\[17]And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.
\[18]Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.
\[19]And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
\[20]And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled there the three sons of Anak.
\[21]And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
\[22]And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD was with them.
\[23]And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)
\[24]And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray you, the entrance into the city, and we will show you mercy.
\[25]And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.
\[26]And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof to this day.
\[27]Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
\[28]And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.
\[29]Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelled in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelled in Gezer among them.
\[30]Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelled among them, and became tributaries.
\[31]Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:
\[32]But the Asherites dwelled among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.
\[33]Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelled among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries to them.
\[34]And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:
\[35]But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.
\[36]And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.

nd an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.
\[2]And you shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; you shall throw down their altars: but you have not obeyed my voice: why have you done this?
\[3]Why I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.
\[4]And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
\[5]And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there to the LORD.
\[6]And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.
\[7]And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.
\[8]And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.
\[9]And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.
\[10]And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.
\[11]And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:
\[12]And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked the LORD to anger.
\[13]And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
\[14]And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
\[15]Wherever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them: and they were greatly distressed.
\[16]Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.
\[17]And yet they would not listen to their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves to them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.
\[18]And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.
\[19]And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.
\[20]And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people has transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not listened to my voice;
\[21]I also will not from now on drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:
\[22]That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.
\[23]Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.

\[2]Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;
\[3]Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelled in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon to the entering in of Hamath.
\[4]And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
\[5]And the children of Israel dwelled among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:
\[6]And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
\[7]And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.
\[8]Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.
\[9]And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
\[10]And the Spirit of the LORD came on him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.
\[11]And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
\[12]And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.
\[13]And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.
\[14]So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
\[15]But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man left handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon the king of Moab.
\[16]But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment on his right thigh.
\[17]And he brought the present to Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.
\[18]And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bore the present.
\[19]But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand to you, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
\[20]And Ehud came to him; and he was sitting in a summer parlor, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God to you.  And he arose out of his seat.
\[21]And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:
\[22]And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
\[23]Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlor on him, and locked them.
\[24]When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlor were locked, they said, Surely he covers his feet in his summer chamber.
\[25]And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlor; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.
\[26]And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirath.
\[27]And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.
\[28]And he said to them, Follow after me: for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.
\[29]And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valor; and there escaped not a man.
\[30]So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.
\[31]And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.

nd the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead.
\[2]And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelled in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
\[3]And the children of Israel cried to the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.
\[4]And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
\[5]And she dwelled under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
\[6]And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said to him, Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?
\[7]And I will draw to you to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.
\[8]And Barak said to her, If you will go with me, then I will go: but if you will not go with me, then I will not go.
\[9]And she said, I will surely go with you: notwithstanding the journey that you take shall not be for your honor; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
\[10]And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.
\[11]Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent to the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.
\[12]And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.
\[13]And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the river of Kishon.
\[14]And Deborah said to Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand: is not the LORD gone out before you? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
\[15]And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.
\[16]But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell on the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.
\[17]However, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
\[18]And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in to her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.
\[19]And he said to her, Give me, I pray you, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
\[20]Again he said to her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man does come and inquire of you, and say, Is there any man here? that you shall say, No.
\[21]Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.
\[22]And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.
\[23]So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
\[24]And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

\[2]Praise you the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.
\[3]Hear, O you kings; give ear, O you princes; I, even I, will sing to the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.
\[4]LORD, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.
\[5]The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.
\[6]In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.
\[7]The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.
\[8]They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
\[9]My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless you the LORD.
\[10]Speak, you that ride on white asses, you that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.
\[11]They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.
\[12]Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead your captivity captive, you son of Abinoam.
\[13]Then he made him that remains have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.
\[14]Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after you, Benjamin, among your people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.
\[15]And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.
\[16]Why stayed you among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.
\[17]Gilead stayed beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and stayed in his breaches.
\[18]Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that risked their lives to the death in the high places of the field.
\[19]The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.
\[20]They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.
\[21]The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, you have trodden down strength.
\[22]Then were the horse hoofs broken by the means of the prancings, the prancings of their mighty ones.
\[23]Curse you Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse you bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.
\[24]Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
\[25]He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.
\[26]She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.
\[27]At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
\[28]The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
\[29]Her wise ladies answered her, yes, she returned answer to herself,
\[30]Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colors, a prey of divers colors of needlework, of divers colors of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?
\[31]So let all your enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.

nd the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
\[2]And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.
\[3]And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;
\[4]And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till you come to Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
\[5]For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.
\[6]And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried to the LORD.
\[7]And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried to the LORD because of the Midianites,
\[8]That the LORD sent a prophet to the children of Israel, which said to them, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;
\[9]And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;
\[10]And I said to you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell: but you have not obeyed my voice.
\[11]And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites.
\[12]And the angel of the LORD appeared to him, and said to him, The LORD is with you, you mighty man of valor.
\[13]And Gideon said to him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD has forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.
\[14]And the LORD looked on him, and said, Go in this your might, and you shall save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent you?
\[15]And he said to him, Oh my Lord, with which shall I save Israel?  behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.
\[16]And the LORD said to him, Surely I will be with you, and you shall smite the Midianites as one man.
\[17]And he said to him, If now I have found grace in your sight, then show me a sign that you talk with me.
\[18]Depart not hence, I pray you, until I come to you, and bring forth my present, and set it before you. And he said, I will tarry until you come again.
\[19]And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it.
\[20]And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.
\[21]Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.
\[22]And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.
\[23]And the LORD said to him, Peace be to you; fear not: you shall not die.
\[24]Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: to this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
\[25]And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Take your father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the grove that is by it:
\[26]And build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which you shall cut down.
\[27]Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said to him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.
\[28]And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered on the altar that was built.
\[29]And they said one to another, Who has done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.
\[30]Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son, that he may die: because he has cast down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the grove that was by it.
\[31]And Joash said to all that stood against him, Will you plead for Baal? will you save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one has cast down his altar.
\[32]Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he has thrown down his altar.
\[33]Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.
\[34]But the Spirit of the LORD came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.
\[35]And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
\[36]And Gideon said to God, If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said,
\[37]Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry on all the earth beside, then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said.
\[38]And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.
\[39]And Gideon said to God, Let not your anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray you, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.
\[40]And God did so that night: for it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.

hen Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
\[2]And the LORD said to Gideon, The people that are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand has saved me.
\[3]Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
\[4]And the LORD said to Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for you there: and it shall be, that of whom I say to you, This shall go with you, the same shall go with you; and of whomsoever I say to you, This shall not go with you, the same shall not go.
\[5]So he brought down the people to the water: and the LORD said to Gideon, Every one that laps of the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, him shall you set by himself; likewise every one that bows down on his knees to drink.
\[6]And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.
\[7]And the LORD said to Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand: and let all the other people go every man to his place.
\[8]So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
\[9]And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Arise, get you down to the host; for I have delivered it into your hand.
\[10]But if you fear to go down, go you with Phurah your servant down to the host:
\[11]And you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall your hands be strengthened to go down to the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men that were in the host.
\[12]And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.
\[13]And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream to his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, see, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came to a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.
\[14]And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand has God delivered Midian, and all the host.
\[15]And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD has delivered into your hand the host of Midian.
\[16]And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.
\[17]And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall you do.
\[18]When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow you the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.
\[19]So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came to the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.
\[20]And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow with: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.
\[21]And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.
\[22]And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, to Tabbath.
\[23]And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.
\[24]And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan.
\[25]And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb on the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the wine press of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.

nd the men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you called us not, when you went to fight with the Midianites?  And they did chide with him sharply.
\[2]And he said to them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
\[3]God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.
\[4]And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.
\[5]And he said to the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread to the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.
\[6]And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?
\[7]And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.
\[8]And he went up there to Penuel, and spoke to them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.
\[9]And he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.
\[10]Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.
\[11]And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelled in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure.
\[12]And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.
\[13]And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,
\[14]And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described to him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even three score and seventeen men.
\[15]And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom you did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your men that are weary?
\[16]And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
\[17]And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.
\[18]Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom you slew at Tabor? And they answered, As you are, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.
\[19]And he said, They were my brothers, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not slay you.
\[20]And he said to Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.
\[21]Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise you, and fall on us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.
\[22]Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule you over us, both you, and your son, and your son's son also: for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.
\[23]And Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.
\[24]And Gideon said to them, I would desire a request of you, that you would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
\[25]And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.
\[26]And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks.
\[27]And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.
\[28]Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.
\[29]And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelled in his own house.
\[30]And Gideon had three score and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.
\[31]And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.
\[32]And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulcher of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
\[33]And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.
\[34]And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:

\[4]And they gave him three score and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.
\[5]And he went to his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, being three score and ten persons, on one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
\[6]And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.
\[7]And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said to them, Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God may listen to you.
\[8]The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive tree, Reign you over us.
\[9]But the olive tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honor God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
\[10]And the trees said to the fig tree, Come you, and reign over us.
\[11]But the fig tree said to them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?
\[12]Then said the trees to the vine, Come you, and reign over us.
\[13]And the vine said to them, Should I leave my wine, which cheers God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
\[14]Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come you, and reign over us.
\[15]And the bramble said to the trees, If in truth you anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
\[16]Now therefore, if you have done truly and sincerely, in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands;
\[17](For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:
\[18]And you are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, three score and ten persons, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)
\[19]If you then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice you in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:
\[20]But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.
\[21]And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelled there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
\[22]When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,
\[23]Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
\[24]That the cruelty done to the three score and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid on Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and on the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brothers.
\[25]And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.
\[26]And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.
\[27]And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and stepped the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.
\[28]And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?
\[29]And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase your army, and come out.
\[30]And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
\[31]And he sent messengers to Abimelech privately, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against you.
\[32]Now therefore up by night, you and the people that is with you, and lie in wait in the field:
\[33]And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early, and set on the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against you, then may you do to them as you shall find occasion.
\[34]And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
\[35]And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait.
\[36]And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said to him, You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.
\[37]And Gaal spoke again, and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.
\[38]Then said Zebul to him, Where is now your mouth, with which you said, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that you have despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.
\[39]And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
\[40]And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even to the entering of the gate.
\[41]And Abimelech dwelled at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
\[42]And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
\[43]And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.
\[44]And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran on all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.
\[45]And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
\[46]And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.
\[47]And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
\[48]And Abimelech got him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said to the people that were with him, What you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.
\[49]And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire on them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
\[50]Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
\[51]But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and got them up to the top of the tower.
\[52]And Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and went hard to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
\[53]And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone on Abimelech's head, and all to broke his skull.
\[54]Then he called hastily to the young man his armor bearer, and said to him, Draw your sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
\[55]And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.
\[56]Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in slaying his seventy brothers:
\[57]And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render on their heads: and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.

\[2]And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
\[3]And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.
\[4]And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
\[5]And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.
\[6]And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.
\[7]And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.
\[8]And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
\[9]Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
\[10]And the children of Israel cried to the LORD, saying, We have sinned against you, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.
\[11]And the LORD said to the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
\[12]The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and you cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.
\[13]Yet you have forsaken me, and served other gods: why I will deliver you no more.
\[14]Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.
\[15]And the children of Israel said to the LORD, We have sinned: do you to us whatever seems good to you; deliver us only, we pray you, this day.
\[16]And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
\[17]Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.
\[18]And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

ow Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.
\[2]And Gilead's wife bore him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said to him, You shall not inherit in our father's house; for you are the son of a strange woman.
\[3]Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and dwelled in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.
\[4]And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
\[5]And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:
\[6]And they said to Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
\[7]And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Did not you hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are you come to me now when you are in distress?
\[8]And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to you now, that you may go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
\[9]And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If you bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?
\[10]And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to your words.
\[11]Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.
\[12]And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come against me to fight in my land?
\[13]And the king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and to Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.
\[14]And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon:
\[15]And said to him, Thus said Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:
\[16]But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness to the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;
\[17]Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray you, pass through your land: but the king of Edom would not listen thereto. And in like manner they sent to the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel stayed in Kadesh.
\[18]Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.
\[19]And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray you, through your land into my place.
\[20]But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
\[21]And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
\[22]And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to Jordan.
\[23]So now the LORD God of Israel has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess it?
\[24]Will not you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.
\[25]And now are you any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,
\[26]While Israel dwelled in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did you not recover them within that time?
\[27]Why I have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
\[28]However, the king of the children of Ammon listened not to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
\[29]Then the Spirit of the LORD came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.
\[30]And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If you shall without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,
\[31]Then it shall be, that whatever comes forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.
\[32]So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.
\[33]And he smote them from Aroer, even till you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
\[34]And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
\[35]And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! you have brought me very low, and you are one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot go back.
\[36]And she said to him, My father, if you have opened your mouth to the LORD, do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth; for as much as the LORD has taken vengeance for you of your enemies, even of the children of Ammon.
\[37]And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down on the mountains, and mourn my virginity, I and my fellows.
\[38]And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity on the mountains.
\[39]And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,
\[40]That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.

\[2]And Jephthah said to them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, you delivered me not out of their hands.
\[3]And when I saw that you delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: why then are you come up to me this day, to fight against me?
\[4]Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.
\[5]And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said to him, Are you an Ephraimite? If he said, No;

nd the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
\[2]And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bore not.
\[3]And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold now, you are barren, and bore not: but you shall conceive, and bear a son.
\[4]Now therefore beware, I pray you, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:
\[5]For, see, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
\[6]Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not from where he was, neither told he me his name:
\[7]But he said to me, Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.
\[8]Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which you did send come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child that shall be born.
\[9]And God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.
\[10]And the woman made haste, and ran, and showed her husband, and said to him, Behold, the man has appeared to me, that came to me the other day.
\[11]And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Are you the man that spoke to the woman? And he said, I am.
\[12]And Manoah said, Now let your words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do to him?
\[13]And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.
\[14]She may not eat of any thing that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.
\[15]And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, I pray you, let us detain you, until we shall have made ready a kid for you.
\[16]And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Though you detain me, I will not eat of your bread: and if you will offer a burnt offering, you must offer it to the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.
\[17]And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, What is your name, that when your sayings come to pass we may do you honor?
\[18]And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why ask you thus after my name, seeing it is secret?
\[19]So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it on a rock to the LORD: and the angel did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.
\[20]For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.
\[21]But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.
\[22]And Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
\[23]But his wife said to him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.
\[24]And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.

\[2]And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.
\[3]Then his father and his mother said to him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of your brothers, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said to his father, Get her for me; for she pleases me well.
\[4]But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.
\[5]Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.
\[6]And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily on him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.
\[7]And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.
\[8]And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion.
\[9]And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.
\[10]So his father went down to the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
\[11]And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
\[12]And Samson said to them, I will now put forth a riddle to you: if you can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:
\[13]But if you cannot declare it me, then shall you give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said to him, Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it.
\[14]And he said to them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.
\[15]And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire: have you called us to take that we have? is it not so?
\[16]And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, You do but hate me, and love me not: you have put forth a riddle to the children of my people, and have not told it me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it you?
\[17]And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore on him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
\[18]And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?  and he said to them, If you had not plowed with my heifer, you had not found out my riddle.
\[19]And the Spirit of the LORD came on him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments to them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.

\[2]And her father said, I truly thought that you had utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray you, instead of her.
\[3]And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.
\[4]And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the middle between two tails.
\[5]And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.

\[12]And they said to him, We are come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me, that you will not fall on me yourselves.
\[13]And they spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind you fast, and deliver you into their hand: but surely we will not kill you. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.
\[14]And when he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily on him, and the cords that were on his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.
\[15]And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.
\[16]And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps on heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.
\[17]And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.
\[18]And he was sore thirsty, and called on the LORD, and said, You have given this great deliverance into the hand of your servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?
\[19]But God split an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water out of there; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: why he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.
\[20]And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.

hen went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in to her.
\[2]And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come here. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.
\[3]And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.
\[4]And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
\[5]And the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will give you every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.
\[6]And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray you, wherein your great strength lies, and with which you might be bound to afflict you.
\[7]And Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven green thongs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.
\[8]Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green thongs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
\[9]Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.  And she said to him, The Philistines be on you, Samson. And he broke the thongs, as a thread of wick is broken when it touches the fire. So his strength was not known.
\[10]And Delilah said to Samson, Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray you, with which you might be bound.
\[11]And he said to her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.
\[12]Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said to him, The Philistines be on you, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he broke them from off his arms like a thread.
\[13]And Delilah said to Samson, Till now you have mocked me, and told me lies: tell me with which you might be bound. And he said to her, If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web.
\[14]And she fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines be on you, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.
\[15]And she said to him, How can you say, I love you, when your heart is not with me? you have mocked me these three times, and have not told me wherein your great strength lies.
\[16]And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed to death;
\[17]That he told her all his heart, and said to her, There has not come a razor on my head; for I have been a Nazarite to God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
\[18]And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he has showed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought money in their hand.
\[19]And she made him sleep on her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
\[20]And she said, The Philistines be on you, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he knew not that the LORD was departed from him.
\[21]But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.
\[22]However, the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.
\[23]Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.
\[24]And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.
\[25]And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.
\[26]And Samson said to the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house stands, that I may lean on them.
\[27]Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.
\[28]And Samson called to the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray you, and strengthen me, I pray you, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.
\[29]And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.
\[30]And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell on the lords, and on all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.
\[31]Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial plot of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.

nd there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
\[2]And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you, about which you cursed, and spoke of also in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be you of the LORD, my son.
\[3]And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it to you.
\[4]Yet he restored the money to his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.
\[5]And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
\[6]In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
\[7]And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
\[8]And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
\[9]And Micah said to him, From where come you? And he said to him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.
\[10]And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and your victuals. So the Levite went in.
\[11]And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.
\[12]And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
\[13]Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.

n those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day all their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.
\[2]And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.
\[3]When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said to him, Who brought you here? and what make you in this place? and what have you here?
\[4]And he said to them, Thus and thus deals Micah with me, and has hired me, and I am his priest.
\[5]And they said to him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
\[6]And the priest said to them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein you go.
\[7]Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelled careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.
\[8]And they came to their brothers to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brothers said to them, What say you?
\[9]And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are you still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.
\[10]When you go, you shall come to a people secure, and to a large land: for God has given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.
\[11]And there went from there of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.
\[12]And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: why they called that place Mahanehdan to this day: behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim.
\[13]And they passed there to mount Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
\[14]Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said to their brothers, Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what you have to do.
\[15]And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and saluted him.
\[16]And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.
\[17]And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.
\[18]And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest to them, What do you?
\[19]And they said to him, Hold your peace, lay your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or that you be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?
\[20]And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the middle of the people.
\[21]So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.
\[22]And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.
\[23]And they cried to the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said to Micah, What ails you, that you come with such a company?
\[24]And he said, You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and you are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that you say to me, What ails you?
\[25]And the children of Dan said to him, Let not your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run on you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household.
\[26]And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.
\[27]And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came to Laish, to a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.
\[28]And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lies by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelled therein.
\[29]And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: however, the name of the city was Laish at the first.
\[30]And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.
\[31]And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

nd it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.
\[2]And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him to her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months.
\[3]And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly to her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
\[4]And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he stayed with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.
\[5]And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said to his son in law, Comfort your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.
\[6]And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said to the man, Be content, I pray you, and tarry all night, and let your heart be merry.
\[7]And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.
\[8]And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Comfort your heart, I pray you. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.
\[9]And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said to him, Behold, now the day draws toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day grows to an end, lodge here, that your heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that you may go home.
\[10]But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.
\[11]And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray you, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
\[12]And his master said to him, We will not turn aside here into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.
\[13]And he said to his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
\[14]And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them when they were by Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.
\[15]And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging.
\[16]And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.
\[17]And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Where go you? and from where come you?
\[18]And he said to him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from there am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receives me to house.
\[19]Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your handmaid, and for the young man which is with your servants: there is no want of any thing.
\[20]And the old man said, Peace be with you; howsoever let all your wants lie on me; only lodge not in the street.
\[21]So he brought him into his house, and gave provender to the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.
\[22]Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into your house, that we may know him.
\[23]And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, No, my brothers, no, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly.
\[24]Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble you them, and do with them what seems good to you: but to this man do not so vile a thing.
\[25]But the men would not listen to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.
\[26]Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.
\[27]And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were on the threshold.
\[28]And he said to her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered.  Then the man took her up on an ass, and the man rose up, and got him to his place.
\[29]And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.
\[30]And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.

hen all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to the LORD in Mizpeh.
\[2]And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
\[3](Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?
\[4]And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
\[5]And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about on me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.
\[6]And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
\[7]Behold, you are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.
\[8]And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.
\[9]But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it;
\[10]And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have worked in Israel.
\[11]So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
\[12]And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?
\[13]Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel.
\[14]But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.
\[15]And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
\[16]Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left handed; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.
\[17]And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.
\[18]And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.
\[19]And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.
\[20]And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.
\[21]And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.
\[22]And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.
\[23](And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)
\[24]And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.
\[25]And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
\[26]Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
\[27]And the children of Israel inquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
\[28]And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into your hand.
\[29]And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.
\[30]And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
\[31]And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
\[32]And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city to the highways.
\[33]And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.
\[34]And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them.
\[35]And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.
\[36]So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted to the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.
\[37]And the liers in wait hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.
\[38]Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.
\[39]And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.
\[40]But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.
\[41]And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come on them.
\[42]Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the middle of them.
\[43]Thus they enclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and stepped them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sun rise.
\[44]And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valor.
\[45]And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them to Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.
\[46]So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valor.
\[47]But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness to the rock Rimmon, and stayed in the rock Rimmon four months.
\[48]And the men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.

\[12]And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
\[13]And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably to them.
\[14]And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.
\[15]And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
\[16]Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?
\[17]And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.
\[18]However, we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that gives a wife to Benjamin.
\[19]Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
\[20]Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;
\[21]And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come you out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
\[22]And it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we will say to them, Be favorable to them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for you did not give to them at this time, that you should be guilty.
\[23]And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned to their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelled in them.
\[24]And the children of Israel departed there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance.
\[25]In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.

ow it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
\[2]And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
\[3]And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.
\[4]And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.
\[5]And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.
\[6]Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.
\[7]Why she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.
\[8]And Naomi said to her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead, and with me.
\[9]The LORD grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
\[10]And they said to her, Surely we will return with you to your people.
\[11]And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will you go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
\[12]Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;
\[13]Would you tarry for them till they were grown? would you stay for them from having husbands? no, my daughters; for it grieves me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.
\[14]And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth joined to her.
\[15]And she said, Behold, your sister in law is gone back to her people, and to her gods: return you after your sister in law.
\[16]And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave you, or to return from following after you: for where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge: your people shall be my people, and your God my God:
\[17]Where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part you and me.
\[18]When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking to her.
\[19]So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?
\[20]And she said to them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
\[21]I went out full and the LORD has brought me home again empty: why then call you me Naomi, seeing the LORD has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?
\[22]So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.

nd Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.
\[2]And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace.  And she said to her, Go, my daughter.
\[3]And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.
\[4]And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless you.
\[5]Then said Boaz to his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?
\[6]And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
\[7]And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.
\[8]Then said Boaz to Ruth, Hear you not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:
\[9]Let your eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go you after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch you? and when you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.
\[10]Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found grace in your eyes, that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?
\[11]And Boaz answered and said to her, It has fully been showed me, all that you have done to your mother in law since the death of your husband: and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your nativity, and are come to a people which you knew not heretofore.
\[12]The LORD recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings you are come to trust.
\[13]Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord; for that you have comforted me, and for that you have spoken friendly to your handmaid, though I be not like to one of your handmaidens.
\[14]And Boaz said to her, At mealtime come you here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.
\[15]And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:
\[16]And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.
\[17]So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.
\[18]And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.
\[19]And her mother in law said to her, Where have you gleaned to day?  and where worked you? blessed be he that did take knowledge of you. And she showed her mother in law with whom she had worked, and said, The man's name with whom I worked to day is Boaz.
\[20]And Naomi said to her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said to her, The man is near of kin to us, one of our next kinsmen.
\[21]And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said to me also, You shall keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
\[22]And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, that they meet you not in any other field.
\[23]So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelled with her mother in law.

hen Naomi her mother in law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?
\[2]And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens you were?  Behold, he winnows barley to night in the threshing floor.
\[3]Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you, and put your raiment on you, and get you down to the floor: but make not yourself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.
\[4]And it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he shall lie, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lay you down; and he will tell you what you shall do.
\[5]And she said to her, All that you say to me I will do.
\[6]And she went down to the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.
\[7]And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.
\[8]And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.
\[9]And he said, Who are you? And she answered, I am Ruth your handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are a near kinsman.
\[10]And he said, Blessed be you of the LORD, my daughter: for you have showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you followed not young men, whether poor or rich.
\[11]And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to you all that you require: for all the city of my people does know that you are a virtuous woman.
\[12]And now it is true that I am your near kinsman: however, there is a kinsman nearer than I.
\[13]Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as the LORD lives: lie down until the morning.
\[14]And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.
\[15]Also he said, Bring the veil that you have on you, and hold it.  And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.
\[16]And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who are you, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.
\[17]And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty to your mother in law.
\[18]Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.

hen went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.
\[2]And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you down here. And they sat down.
\[3]And he said to the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, sells a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:
\[4]And I thought to advertise you, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it: but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside you; and I am after you. And he said, I will redeem it.
\[5]Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.
\[6]And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance: redeem you my right to yourself; for I cannot redeem it.
\[7]Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor: and this was a testimony in Israel.
\[8]Therefore the kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for you. So he drew off his shoe.
\[9]And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.
\[10]Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you are witnesses this day.
\[11]And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do you worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:
\[12]And let your house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give you of this young woman.
\[13]So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in to her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.
\[14]And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which has not left you this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.
\[15]And he shall be to you a restorer of your life, and a nourisher of your old age: for your daughter in law, which loves you, which is better to you than seven sons, has born him.
\[16]And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it.
\[17]And the women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
\[18]Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,
\[19]And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,
\[20]And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
\[21]And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,
\[22]And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.

ow there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
\[2]And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
\[3]And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.
\[4]And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
\[5]But to Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.
\[6]And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.
\[7]And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
\[8]Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weep you? and why eat you not? and why is your heart grieved? am not I better to you than ten sons?
\[9]So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat on a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.
\[10]And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, and wept sore.
\[11]And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a man child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come on his head.
\[12]And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.
\[13]Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
\[14]And Eli said to her, How long will you be drunken? put away your wine from you.
\[15]And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.
\[16]Count not your handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken till now.
\[17]Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant you your petition that you have asked of him.
\[18]And she said, Let your handmaid find grace in your sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.
\[19]And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.
\[20]Why it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.
\[21]And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
\[22]But Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.
\[23]And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems you good; tarry until you have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman stayed, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.
\[24]And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.
\[25]And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
\[26]And she said, Oh my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman that stood by you here, praying to the LORD.
\[27]For this child I prayed; and the LORD has given me my petition which I asked of him:
\[28]Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he lives he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.

\[2]There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside you: neither is there any rock like our God.
\[3]Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogance come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
\[4]The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
\[5]They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren has born seven; and she that has many children is waxed feeble.
\[6]The LORD kills, and makes alive: he brings down to the grave, and brings up.
\[7]The LORD makes poor, and makes rich: he brings low, and lifts up.
\[8]He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he has set the world on them.
\[9]He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
\[10]The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder on them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.
\[11]And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister to the LORD before Eli the priest.
\[12]Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.
\[13]And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a meat hook of three teeth in his hand;
\[14]And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the meat hook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came thither.
\[15]Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of you, but raw.
\[16]And if any man said to him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would answer him, No; but you shall give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.
\[17]Why the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.
\[18]But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.
\[19]Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
\[20]And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give you seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went to their own home.
\[21]And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.
\[22]Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[23]And he said to them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.
\[24]No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make the LORD's people to transgress.
\[25]If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they listened not to the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.
\[26]And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favor both with the LORD, and also with men.
\[27]And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus said the LORD, Did I plainly appear to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?
\[28]And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer on my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give to the house of your father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?
\[29]Why kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the most chief of all the offerings of Israel my people?
\[30]Why the LORD God of Israel said, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD said, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
\[31]Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father's house, that there shall not be an old man in your house.
\[32]And you shall see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in your house for ever.
\[33]And the man of yours, whom I shall not cut off from my altar, shall be to consume your eyes, and to grieve your heart: and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age.
\[34]And this shall be a sign to you, that shall come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.
\[35]And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed for ever.
\[36]And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in your house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray you, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.

nd the child Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.
\[2]And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;
\[3]And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;
\[4]That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.
\[5]And he ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
\[6]And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you did call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
\[7]Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed to him.
\[8]And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you did call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.
\[9]Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call you, that you shall say, Speak, LORD; for your servant hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
\[10]And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for your servant hears.
\[11]And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that hears it shall tingle.
\[12]In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.
\[13]For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knows; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
\[14]And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
\[15]And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.
\[16]Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.
\[17]And he said, What is the thing that the LORD has said to you? I pray you hide it not from me: God do so to you, and more also, if you hide any thing from me of all the things that he said to you.
\[18]And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seems him good.
\[19]And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
\[20]And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.

\[2]And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.
\[3]And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh to us, that, when it comes among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.
\[4]So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwells between the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
\[5]And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
\[6]And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What means the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.
\[7]And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe to us! for there has not been such a thing heretofore.
\[8]Woe to us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
\[9]Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O you Philistines, that you be not servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
\[10]And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
\[11]And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
\[12]And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth on his head.
\[13]And when he came, see, Eli sat on a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.
\[14]And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What means the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.
\[15]Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.
\[16]And the man said to Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?
\[17]And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
\[18]And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
\[19]And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came on her.
\[20]And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said to her, Fear not; for you have born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.
\[21]And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.
\[22]And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.

\[2]When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
\[3]And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
\[4]And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off on the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.
\[5]Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.
\[6]But the hand of the LORD was heavy on them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.
\[7]And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore on us, and on Dagon our god.
\[8]They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about to Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.
\[9]And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had tumors in their secret parts.
\[10]Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.
\[11]So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
\[12]And the men that died not were smitten with the tumors: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.

nd the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
\[2]And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us with which we shall send it to his place.
\[3]And they said, If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then you shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
\[4]Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.
\[5]Why you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
\[6]Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had worked wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
\[7]Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milk cows, on which there has come no yoke, and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:
\[8]And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it on the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which you return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.
\[9]And see, if it goes up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he has done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us.
\[10]And the men did so; and took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:
\[11]And they laid the ark of the LORD on the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.
\[12]And the cows took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Bethshemesh.
\[13]And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.
\[14]And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they split the wood of the cart, and offered the cows a burnt offering to the LORD.
\[15]And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to the LORD.
\[16]And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.
\[17]And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
\[18]And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even to the great stone of Abel, where on they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite.
\[19]And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and three score and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.
\[20]And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?
\[21]And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come you down, and fetch it up to you.

\[2]And it came to pass, while the ark stayed in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.
\[3]And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If you do return to the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts to the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
\[4]Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.
\[5]And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to the LORD.
\[6]And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.
\[7]And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
\[8]And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry to the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.
\[9]And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly to the LORD: and Samuel cried to the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him.
\[10]And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.
\[11]And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.
\[12]Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Till now has the LORD helped us.
\[13]So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
\[14]And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
\[15]And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
\[16]And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.

\[2]Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.
\[3]And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
\[4]Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel to Ramah,
\[5]And said to him, Behold, you are old, and your sons walk not in your ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.
\[6]But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed to the LORD.
\[7]And the LORD said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you: for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.
\[8]According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, with which they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also to you.
\[9]Now therefore listen to their voice: however, yet protest solemnly to them, and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.
\[10]And Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people that asked of him a king.
\[11]And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.
\[12]And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.
\[13]And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.
\[14]And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive groves, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.
\[15]And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
\[16]And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your best young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.
\[17]He will take the tenth of your sheep: and you shall be his servants.
\[18]And you shall cry out in that day because of your king which you shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.
\[19]Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, No; but we will have a king over us;
\[20]That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
\[21]And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.

ow there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.
\[2]And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.
\[3]And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the asses.
\[4]And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.
\[5]And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.
\[6]And he said to him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he said comes surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can show us our way that we should go.
\[7]Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?
\[8]And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.
\[9](Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spoke, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)
\[10]Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was.
\[11]And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?
\[12]And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:
\[13]As soon as you be come into the city, you shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he does bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time you shall find him.
\[14]And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.
\[15]Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,
\[16]To morrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people, because their cry is come to me.
\[17]And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, Behold the man whom I spoke to you of! this same shall reign over my people.
\[18]Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray you, where the seer's house is.
\[19]And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me to the high place; for you shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.
\[20]And as for your asses that were lost three days ago, set not your mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on you, and on all your father's house?
\[21]And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? why then speak you so to me?
\[22]And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlor, and made them sit in the most chief place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.
\[23]And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, Set it by you.
\[24]And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before you, and eat: for to this time has it been kept for you since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
\[25]And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul on the top of the house.
\[26]And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send you away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
\[27]And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand you still a while, that I may show you the word of God.

\[2]When you are departed from me to day, then you shall find two men by Rachel's sepulcher in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, The asses which you went to seek are found: and, see, your father has left the care of the asses, and sorrows for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
\[3]Then shall you go on forward from there, and you shall come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet you three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
\[4]And they will salute you, and give you two loaves of bread; which you shall receive of their hands.
\[5]After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when you are come thither to the city, that you shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:
\[6]And the Spirit of the LORD will come on you, and you shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.
\[7]And let it be, when these signs are come to you, that you do as occasion serve you; for God is with you.
\[8]And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shall you tarry, till I come to you, and show you what you shall do.
\[9]And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.
\[10]And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came on him, and he prophesied among them.
\[11]And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
\[12]And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
\[13]And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
\[14]And Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Where went you?  And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.
\[15]And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray you, what Samuel said to you.
\[16]And Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spoke, he told him not.
\[17]And Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpeh;
\[18]And said to the children of Israel, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:
\[19]And you have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and you have said to him, No, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.
\[20]And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
\[21]When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.
\[22]Therefore they inquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he has hid himself among the stuff.
\[23]And they ran and fetched him there: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
\[24]And Samuel said to all the people, See you him whom the LORD has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.
\[25]Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
\[26]And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.

\[14]If you will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both you and also the king that reigns over you continue following the LORD your God:
\[15]But if you will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.
\[16]Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.
\[17]Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call to the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that you may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.
\[18]So Samuel called to the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
\[19]And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, that we die not: for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.
\[20]And Samuel said to the people, Fear not: you have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;
\[21]And turn you not aside: for then should you go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.
\[22]For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it has pleased the LORD to make you his people.
\[23]Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:
\[24]Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he has done for you.
\[25]But if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed, both you and your king.

aul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
\[2]Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
\[3]And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
\[4]And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
\[5]And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.
\[6]When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
\[7]And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
\[8]And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
\[9]And Saul said, Bring here a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.
\[10]And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
\[11]And Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you came not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;
\[12]Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now on me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.
\[13]And Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly: you have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which he commanded you: for now would the LORD have established your kingdom on Israel for ever.
\[14]But now your kingdom shall not continue: the LORD has sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD has commanded him to be captain over his people, because you have not kept that which the LORD commanded you.
\[15]And Samuel arose, and got him up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.
\[16]And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, stayed in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
\[17]And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual:
\[18]And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looks to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
\[19]Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:
\[20]But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his ax, and his mattock.
\[21]Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.
\[22]So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
\[23]And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.

ow it came to pass on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.
\[2]And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;
\[3]And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
\[4]And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
\[5]The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.
\[6]And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.
\[7]And his armor bearer said to him, Do all that is in your heart: turn you; behold, I am with you according to your heart.
\[8]Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to these men, and we will discover ourselves to them.
\[9]If they say thus to us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.
\[10]But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up: for the LORD has delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign to us.
\[11]And both of them discovered themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
\[12]And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said to his armor bearer, Come up after me: for the LORD has delivered them into the hand of Israel.
\[13]And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor bearer slew after him.
\[14]And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.
\[15]And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.
\[16]And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.
\[17]Then said Saul to the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.
\[18]And Saul said to Ahiah, Bring here the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
\[19]And it came to pass, while Saul talked to the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw your hand.
\[20]And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.
\[21]Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.
\[22]Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
\[23]So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over to Bethaven.
\[24]And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eats any food until evening, that I may be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.
\[25]And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey on the ground.
\[26]And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.
\[27]But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: why he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
\[28]Then answered one of the people, and said, Your father straightly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eats any food this day. And the people were faint.
\[29]Then said Jonathan, My father has troubled the land: see, I pray you, how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.
\[30]How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
\[31]And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.
\[32]And the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.
\[33]Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, You have transgressed: roll a great stone to me this day.
\[34]And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood.  And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.
\[35]And Saul built an altar to the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built to the LORD.
\[36]And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatever seems good to you. Then said the priest, Let us draw near here to God.
\[37]And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? will you deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.
\[38]And Saul said, Draw you near here, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin has been this day.
\[39]For, as the LORD lives, which saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.
\[40]Then said he to all Israel, Be you on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what seems good to you.
\[41]Therefore Saul said to the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot.  And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.
\[42]And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
\[43]Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand, and, see, I must die.
\[44]And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for you shall surely die, Jonathan.
\[45]And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.
\[46]Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
\[47]So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he vexed them.
\[48]And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.
\[49]Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
\[50]And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
\[51]And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
\[52]And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him to him.

amuel also said to Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore listen you to the voice of the words of the LORD.
\[2]Thus said the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.
\[3]Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
\[4]And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
\[5]And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
\[6]And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
\[7]And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until you come to Shur, that is over against Egypt.
\[8]And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
\[9]But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatted calves, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
\[10]Then came the word of the LORD to Samuel, saying,
\[11]It repents me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried to the LORD all night.
\[12]And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
\[13]And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said to him, Blessed be you of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.
\[14]And Samuel said, What means then this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
\[15]And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
\[16]Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what the LORD has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.
\[17]And Samuel said, When you were little in your own sight, were you not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed you king over Israel?
\[18]And the LORD sent you on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.
\[19]Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD, but did fly on the spoil, and did evil in the sight of the LORD?
\[20]And Saul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
\[21]But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal.
\[22]And Samuel said, Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.
\[23]For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king.
\[24]And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and your words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
\[25]Now therefore, I pray you, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.
\[26]And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you: for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.
\[27]And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold on the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
\[28]And Samuel said to him, The LORD has rent the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, that is better than you.
\[29]And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.
\[30]Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray you, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD your God.
\[31]So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.
\[32]Then said Samuel, Bring you here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
\[33]And Samuel said, As the sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.
\[34]Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
\[35]And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.

nd the LORD said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill your horn with oil, and go, I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.
\[2]And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with you, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.
\[3]And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do: and you shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.
\[4]And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Come you peaceably?
\[5]And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice to the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
\[6]And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.
\[7]But the LORD said to Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD sees not as man sees; for man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.
\[8]Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has the LORD chosen this.
\[9]Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither has the LORD chosen this.
\[10]Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, The LORD has not chosen these.
\[11]And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all your children? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he keeps the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come here.
\[12]And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and with of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.
\[13]Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the middle of his brothers: and the Spirit of the LORD came on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
\[14]But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.
\[15]And Saul's servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.
\[16]Let our lord now command your servants, which are before you, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is on you, that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well.
\[17]And Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.
\[18]Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.
\[19]Why Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send me David your son, which is with the sheep.
\[20]And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul.
\[21]And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.
\[22]And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray you, stand before me; for he has found favor in my sight.
\[23]And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was on Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.

ow the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongs to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.
\[2]And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
\[3]And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.
\[4]And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
\[5]And he had an helmet of brass on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.
\[6]And he had greaves of brass on his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.
\[7]And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.
\[8]And he stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, Why are you come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.
\[9]If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall you be our servants, and serve us.
\[10]And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.
\[11]When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
\[12]Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.
\[13]And the three oldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
\[14]And David was the youngest: and the three oldest followed Saul.
\[15]But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
\[16]And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
\[17]And Jesse said to David his son, Take now for your brothers an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp of your brothers;
\[18]And carry these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and look how your brothers fare, and take their pledge.
\[19]Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
\[20]And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.
\[21]For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.
\[22]And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brothers.
\[23]And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them.
\[24]And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.
\[25]And the men of Israel said, Have you seen this man that is come up?  surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.
\[26]And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
\[27]And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that kills him.
\[28]And Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why came you down here? and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart; for you are come down that you might see the battle.
\[29]And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?
\[30]And he turned from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.
\[31]And when the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.
\[32]And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
\[33]And Saul said to David, You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
\[34]And David said to Saul, Your servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:
\[35]And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.
\[36]Your servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.
\[37]David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and the LORD be with you.
\[38]And Saul armed David with his armor, and he put an helmet of brass on his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.
\[39]And David girded his sword on his armor, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said to Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.
\[40]And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a money; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.
\[41]And the Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man that bore the shield went before him.
\[42]And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.
\[43]And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
\[44]And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.
\[45]Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
\[46]This day will the LORD deliver you into my hand; and I will smite you, and take your head from you; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day to the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
\[47]And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.
\[48]And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew near to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.
\[49]And David put his hand in his bag, and took there a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell on his face to the earth.
\[50]So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.
\[51]Therefore David ran, and stood on the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.
\[52]And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until you come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron.  And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron.
\[53]And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.
\[54]And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.
\[55]And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.
\[56]And the king said, Inquire you whose son the stripling is.
\[57]And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
\[58]And Saul said to him, Whose son are you, you young man? And David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.

nd it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
\[2]And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.
\[3]Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
\[4]And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
\[5]And David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
\[6]And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.
\[7]And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
\[8]And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?
\[9]And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
\[10]And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came on Saul, and he prophesied in the middle of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.
\[11]And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.
\[12]And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.
\[13]Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
\[14]And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.
\[15]Why when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.
\[16]But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.
\[17]And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give you to wife: only be you valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles.  For Saul said, Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him.
\[18]And David said to Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?
\[19]But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
\[20]And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
\[21]And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Why Saul said to David, You shall this day be my son in law in the one of the two.
\[22]And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you: now therefore be the king's son in law.
\[23]And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seems it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
\[24]And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spoke David.
\[25]And Saul said, Thus shall you say to David, The king desires not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
\[26]And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.
\[27]Why David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.
\[28]And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him.
\[29]And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.
\[30]Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.

nd Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.
\[2]But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill you: now therefore, I pray you, take heed to yourself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide yourself:
\[3]And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will commune with my father of you; and what I see, that I will tell you.
\[4]And Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been to you-ward very good:
\[5]For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD worked a great salvation for all Israel: you saw it, and did rejoice: why then will you sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?
\[6]And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, As the LORD lives, he shall not be slain.
\[7]And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things.  And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.
\[8]And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.
\[9]And the evil spirit from the LORD was on Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.
\[10]And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.
\[11]Saul also sent messengers to David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If you save not your life to night, to morrow you shall be slain.
\[12]So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.
\[13]And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.
\[14]And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.
\[15]And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.
\[16]And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.
\[17]And Saul said to Michal, Why have you deceived me so, and sent away my enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said to me, Let me go; why should I kill you?
\[18]So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelled in Naioth.
\[19]And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
\[20]And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was on the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
\[21]And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.
\[22]Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.
\[23]And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
\[24]And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Why they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?

nd David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is my iniquity? and what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?
\[2]And he said to him, God forbid; you shall not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will show it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.
\[3]And David swore moreover, and said, Your father certainly knows that I have found grace in your eyes; and he said, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.
\[4]Then said Jonathan to David, Whatever your soul desires, I will even do it for you.
\[5]And David said to Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at even.
\[6]If your father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
\[7]If he say thus, It is well; your servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.
\[8]Therefore you shall deal kindly with your servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me yourself; for why should you bring me to your father?
\[9]And Jonathan said, Far be it from you: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come on you, then would not I tell it you?
\[10]Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if your father answer you roughly?
\[11]And Jonathan said to David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
\[12]And Jonathan said to David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not to you, and show it you;
\[13]The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do you evil, then I will show it you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and the LORD be with you, as he has been with my father.
\[14]And you shall not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:
\[15]But also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD has cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.
\[16]So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.
\[17]And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
\[18]Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and you shall be missed, because your seat will be empty.
\[19]And when you have stayed three days, then you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.
\[20]And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.
\[21]And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say to the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you, take them; then come you: for there is peace to you, and no hurt; as the LORD lives.
\[22]But if I say thus to the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond you; go your way: for the LORD has sent you away.
\[23]And as touching the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between you and me for ever.
\[24]So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.
\[25]And the king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.
\[26]Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day: for he thought, Something has befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.
\[27]And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why comes not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?
\[28]And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:
\[29]And he said, Let me go, I pray you; for our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away, I pray you, and see my brothers. Therefore he comes not to the king's table.
\[30]Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own confusion, and to the confusion of your mother's nakedness?
\[31]For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the ground, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Why now send and fetch him to me, for he shall surely die.
\[32]And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why shall he be slain? what has he done?
\[33]And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.
\[34]So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
\[35]And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.
\[36]And he said to his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
\[37]And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond you?
\[38]And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
\[39]But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
\[40]And Jonathan gave his artillery to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city.
\[41]And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.
\[42]And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, for as much as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.

hen came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said to him, Why are you alone, and no man with you?
\[2]And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me a business, and has said to me, Let no man know any thing of the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.
\[3]Now therefore what is under your hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or what there is present.
\[4]And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.
\[5]And David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yes, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.
\[6]So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the show bread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
\[7]Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the most chief of the herdsmen that belonged to Saul.
\[8]And David said to Ahimelech, And is there not here under your hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.
\[9]And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if you will take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.
\[10]And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
\[11]And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
\[12]And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
\[13]And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.
\[14]Then said Achish to his servants, See, you see the man is mad: why then have you brought him to me?
\[15]Have I need of mad men, that you have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?

avid therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.
\[2]And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves to him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.
\[3]And David went there to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray you, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.
\[4]And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelled with him all the while that David was in the hold.
\[5]And the prophet Gad said to David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get you into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.
\[6]When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul stayed in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)
\[7]Then Saul said to his servants that stood about him, Hear now, you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;
\[8]That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that shows me that my son has made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or shows to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
\[9]Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
\[10]And he inquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
\[11]Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.
\[12]And Saul said, Hear now, you son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.
\[13]And Saul said to him, Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread, and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
\[14]Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all your servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goes at your bidding, and is honorable in your house?
\[15]Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing to his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for your servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.
\[16]And the king said, You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all your father's house.
\[17]And the king said to the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall on the priests of the LORD.
\[18]And the king said to Doeg, Turn you, and fall on the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell on the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.
\[19]And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
\[20]And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.
\[21]And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests.
\[22]And David said to Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of your father's house.
\[23]Abide you with me, fear not: for he that seeks my life seeks your life: but with me you shall be in safeguard.

\[2]Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said to David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.
\[3]And David's men said to him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
\[4]Then David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.
\[5]So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
\[6]And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.
\[7]And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that has gates and bars.
\[8]And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
\[9]And David knew that Saul secretly practiced mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.
\[10]Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, your servant has certainly heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
\[11]Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.
\[12]Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver you up.
\[13]Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he declined to go forth.
\[14]And David stayed in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.
\[15]And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.
\[16]And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
\[17]And he said to him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you; and that also Saul my father knows.
\[18]And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David stayed in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.
\[19]Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?
\[20]Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.
\[21]And Saul said, Blessed be you of the LORD; for you have compassion on me.
\[22]Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there: for it is told me that he deals very subtly.
\[23]See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself, and come you again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.
\[24]And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.
\[25]Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David; why he came down into a rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
\[26]And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.
\[27]But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste you, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.
\[28]Why Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.
\[29]And David went up from there, and dwelled in strong holds at Engedi.

nd it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.
\[2]Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats.
\[3]And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.
\[4]And the men of David said to him, Behold the day of which the LORD said to you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do to him as it shall seem good to you. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privately.
\[5]And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
\[6]And he said to his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.
\[7]So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.
\[8]David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.
\[9]And David said to Saul, Why hear you men's words, saying, Behold, David seeks your hurt?
\[10]Behold, this day your eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered you to day into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill you: but my eye spared you; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is the LORD's anointed.
\[11]Moreover, my father, see, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and killed you not, know you and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against you; yet you hunt my soul to take it.
\[12]The LORD judge between me and you, and the LORD avenge me of you: but my hand shall not be on you.
\[13]As said the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceeds from the wicked: but my hand shall not be on you.
\[14]After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom do you pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.
\[15]The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.
\[16]And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
\[17]And he said to David, You are more righteous than I: for you have rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded you evil.
\[18]And you have showed this day how that you have dealt well with me: for as much as when the LORD had delivered me into your hand, you killed me not.
\[19]For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? why the LORD reward you good for that you have done to me this day.
\[20]And now, behold, I know well that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.
\[21]Swear now therefore to me by the LORD, that you will not cut off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father's house.
\[22]And David swore to Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men got them up to the hold.

nd Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
\[2]And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
\[3]Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.
\[4]And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.
\[5]And David sent out ten young men, and David said to the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:
\[6]And thus shall you say to him that lives in prosperity, Peace be both to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.
\[7]And now I have heard that you have shearers: now your shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing to them, all the while they were in Carmel.
\[8]Ask your young men, and they will show you. Why let the young men find favor in your eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray you, whatever comes to your hand to your servants, and to your son David.
\[9]And when David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
\[10]And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.
\[11]Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men, whom I know not from where they be?
\[12]So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.
\[13]And David said to his men, Gird you on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred stayed by the stuff.
\[14]But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.
\[15]But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:
\[16]They were a wall to us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
\[17]Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.
\[18]Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.
\[19]And she said to her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.
\[20]And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.
\[21]Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him: and he has requited me evil for good.
\[22]So and more also do God to the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that urinates against the wall.
\[23]And when Abigail saw David, she hurried, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
\[24]And fell at his feet, and said, On me, my lord, on me let this iniquity be: and let your handmaid, I pray you, speak in your audience, and hear the words of your handmaid.
\[25]Let not my lord, I pray you, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I your handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom you did send.
\[26]Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, seeing the LORD has withheld you from coming to shed blood, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now let your enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
\[27]And now this blessing which your handmaid has brought to my lord, let it even be given to the young men that follow my lord.
\[28]I pray you, forgive the trespass of your handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fights the battles of the LORD, and evil has not been found in you all your days.
\[29]Yet a man is risen to pursue you, and to seek your soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD your God; and the souls of your enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.
\[30]And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and shall have appointed you ruler over Israel;
\[31]That this shall be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood causeless, or that my lord has avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember your handmaid.
\[32]And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent you this day to meet me:
\[33]And blessed be your advice, and blessed be you, which have kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with my own hand.
\[34]For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel lives, which has kept me back from hurting you, except you had hurried and come to meet me, surely there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light any that urinates against the wall.
\[35]So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said to her, Go up in peace to your house; see, I have listened to your voice, and have accepted your person.
\[36]And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: why she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
\[37]But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
\[38]And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.
\[39]And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept his servant from evil: for the LORD has returned the wickedness of Nabal on his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.
\[40]And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, David sent us to you, to take you to him to wife.
\[41]And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let your handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
\[42]And Abigail hurried, and arose and rode on an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
\[43]David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.
\[44]But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.

nd the Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?
\[2]Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
\[3]And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
\[4]David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.
\[5]And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.
\[6]Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with you.
\[7]So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.
\[8]Then said Abishai to David, God has delivered your enemy into your hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray you, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.
\[9]And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?
\[10]David said furthermore, As the LORD lives, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.
\[11]The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray you, take you now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.
\[12]So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they got them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen on them.
\[13]Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:
\[14]And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answer you not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who are you that cry to the king?
\[15]And David said to Abner, Are not you a valiant man? and who is like to you in Israel? why then have you not kept your lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king your lord.
\[16]This thing is not good that you have done. As the LORD lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed.  And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.
\[17]And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this your voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.
\[18]And he said, Why does my lord thus pursue after his servant?  for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?
\[19]Now therefore, I pray you, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.
\[20]Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one does hunt a partridge in the mountains.
\[21]Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do you harm, because my soul was precious in your eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
\[22]And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.
\[23]The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered you into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth my hand against the LORD's anointed.
\[24]And, behold, as your life was much set by this day in my eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.
\[25]Then Saul said to David, Blessed be you, my son David: you shall both do great things, and also shall still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

\[2]And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him to Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
\[3]And David dwelled with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.
\[4]And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.
\[5]And David said to Achish, If I have now found grace in your eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?
\[6]Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: why Ziklag pertains to the kings of Judah to this day.
\[7]And the time that David dwelled in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
\[8]And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.
\[9]And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.
\[10]And Achish said, Where have you made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.
\[11]And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwells in the country of the Philistines.
\[12]And Achish believed David, saying, He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.

\[3]Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
\[4]And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.
\[5]And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.
\[6]And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
\[7]Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman that has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that has a familiar spirit at Endor.
\[8]And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray you, divine to me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name to you.
\[9]And the woman said to him, Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: why then lay you a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
\[10]And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD lives, there shall no punishment happen to you for this thing.
\[11]Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up to you? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
\[12]And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived me? for you are Saul.
\[13]And the king said to her, Be not afraid: for what saw you? And the woman said to Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.
\[14]And he said to her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man comes up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.
\[15]And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do.
\[16]Then said Samuel, Why then do you ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from you, and is become your enemy?
\[17]And the LORD has done to him, as he spoke by me: for the LORD has rent the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, even to David:
\[18]Because you obeyed not the voice of the LORD, nor executed his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore has the LORD done this thing to you this day.
\[19]Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shall you and your sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
\[20]Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
\[21]And the woman came to Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said to him, Behold, your handmaid has obeyed your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.
\[22]Now therefore, I pray you, listen you also to the voice of your handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your way.
\[23]But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he listened to their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat on the bed.
\[24]And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hurried, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:
\[25]And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.

\[3]Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here?  And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which has been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell to me to this day?
\[4]And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for with which should he reconcile himself to his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?
\[5]Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
\[6]Then Achish called David, and said to him, Surely, as the LORD lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day: nevertheless the lords favor you not.
\[7]Why now return, and go in peace, that you displease not the lords of the Philistines.
\[8]And David said to Achish, But what have I done? and what have you found in your servant so long as I have been with you to this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
\[9]And Achish answered and said to David, I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
\[10]Why now rise up early in the morning with your master's servants that are come with you: and as soon as you be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.

\[2]And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.
\[3]So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.
\[4]Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
\[5]And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
\[6]And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.
\[7]And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray you, bring me here the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.
\[8]And David inquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for you shall surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.
\[9]So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.
\[10]But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred stayed behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.
\[11]And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;
\[12]And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.
\[13]And David said to him, To whom belong you? and from where are you? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.
\[14]We made an invasion on the south of the Cherethites, and on the coast which belongs to Judah, and on the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
\[15]And David said to him, Can you bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear to me by God, that you will neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this company.
\[16]And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad on all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
\[17]And David smote them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode on camels, and fled.
\[18]And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.
\[19]And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.
\[20]And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.
\[21]And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
\[22]Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.
\[23]Then said David, You shall not do so, my brothers, with that which the LORD has given us, who has preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.
\[24]For who will listen to you in this matter? but as his part is that goes down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarries by the stuff: they shall part alike.
\[25]And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
\[26]And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;
\[27]To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,
\[28]And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,

\[3]And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.
\[4]Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell on it.

\[11]And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;
\[12]All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
\[13]And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

ow it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag;
\[2]It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
\[3]And David said to him, From where come you? And he said to him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
\[4]And David said to him, How went the matter? I pray you, tell me.  And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
\[5]And David said to the young man that told him, How know you that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?
\[6]And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance on mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned on his spear; and, see, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
\[7]And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here am I.
\[8]And he said to me, Who are you? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
\[9]He said to me again, Stand, I pray you, on me, and slay me: for anguish is come on me, because my life is yet whole in me.
\[10]So I stood on him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.
\[11]Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:
\[12]And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
\[13]And David said to the young man that told him, From where are you? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
\[14]And David said to him, How were you not afraid to stretch forth your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?
\[15]And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall on him. And he smote him that he died.
\[16]And David said to him, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.
\[17]And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
\[18](Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)
\[19]The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places: how are the mighty fallen!
\[20]Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
\[21]You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, on you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.
\[22]From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
\[23]Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
\[24]You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold on your apparel.
\[25]How are the mighty fallen in the middle of the battle! O Jonathan, you were slain in your high places.
\[26]I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant have you been to me: your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
\[27]How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

nd it came to pass after this, that David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said to him, Go up. And David said, Where shall I go up? And he said, To Hebron.
\[2]So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.
\[3]And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelled in the cities of Hebron.
\[4]And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.
\[5]And David sent messengers to the men of Jabeshgilead, and said to them, Blessed be you of the LORD, that you have showed this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.
\[6]And now the LORD show kindness and truth to you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because you have done this thing.
\[7]Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be you valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
\[8]But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
\[9]And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
\[10]Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
\[11]And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
\[12]And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
\[13]And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
\[14]And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
\[15]Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
\[16]And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: why that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.
\[17]And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
\[18]And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.
\[19]And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
\[20]Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Are you Asahel? And he answered, I am.
\[21]And Abner said to him, Turn you aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay you hold on one of the young men, and take you his armor.  But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.
\[22]And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn you aside from following me: why should I smite you to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?
\[23]However, he refused to turn aside: why Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.
\[24]Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
\[25]And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.
\[26]Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever?  know you not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere you bid the people return from following their brothers?
\[27]And Joab said, As God lives, unless you had spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.
\[28]So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
\[29]And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.
\[30]And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.
\[31]But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and three score men died.
\[32]And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulcher of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.

ow there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.
\[2]And to David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
\[3]And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
\[4]And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
\[5]And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
\[6]And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.
\[7]And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?
\[8]Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do show kindness this day to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David, that you charge me to day with a fault concerning this woman?
\[9]So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD has sworn to David, even so I do to him;
\[10]To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.
\[11]And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.
\[12]And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make your league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring about all Israel to you.
\[13]And he said, Well; I will make a league with you: but one thing I require of you, that is, You shall not see my face, except you first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face.
\[14]And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
\[15]And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.
\[16]And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim.  Then said Abner to him, Go, return. And he returned.
\[17]And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, You sought for David in times past to be king over you:
\[18]Now then do it: for the LORD has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
\[19]And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.
\[20]So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.
\[21]And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a league with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
\[22]And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.
\[23]When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
\[24]Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? behold, Abner came to you; why is it that you have sent him away, and he is quite gone?
\[25]You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.
\[26]And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.
\[27]And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
\[28]And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:
\[29]Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that has an issue, or that is a leper, or that leans on a staff, or that falls on the sword, or that lacks bread.
\[30]So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
\[31]And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.
\[32]And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
\[33]And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dies?
\[34]Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters: as a man falls before wicked men, so fell you. And all the people wept again over him.
\[35]And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.
\[36]And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatever the king did pleased all the people.
\[37]For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.
\[38]And the king said to his servants, Know you not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
\[39]And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.

nd when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
\[2]And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.
\[3]And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)
\[4]And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
\[5]And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.
\[6]And they came thither into the middle of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
\[7]For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and got them away through the plain all night.
\[8]And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul your enemy, which sought your life; and the LORD has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.
\[9]And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
\[10]When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:
\[11]How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
\[12]And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulcher of Abner in Hebron.

hen came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
\[2]Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were he that led out and brought in Israel: and the LORD said to you, You shall feed my people Israel, and you shall be a captain over Israel.
\[3]So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.
\[4]David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
\[5]In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
\[6]And the king and his men went to Jerusalem to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spoke to David, saying, Except you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here: thinking, David cannot come in here.
\[7]Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.
\[8]And David said on that day, Whoever gets up to the gutter, and smites the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Why they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
\[9]So David dwelled in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.
\[10]And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.
\[11]And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.
\[12]And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.
\[13]And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
\[14]And these be the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
\[15]Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
\[16]And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.
\[17]But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.
\[18]The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\[19]And David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? will you deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said to David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into your hand.
\[20]And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD has broken forth on my enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.
\[21]And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.
\[22]And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\[23]And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, You shall not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come on them over against the mulberry trees.
\[24]And let it be, when you hear the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall bestir yourself: for then shall the LORD go out before you, to smite the host of the Philistines.
\[25]And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gazer.

gain, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
\[2]And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwells between the cherubim.
\[3]And they set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.
\[4]And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.
\[5]And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on tambourines, and on cornets, and on cymbals.
\[6]And when they came to Nachon's threshing floor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.
\[7]And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.
\[8]And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach on Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.
\[9]And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?
\[10]So David would not remove the ark of the LORD to him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.
\[11]And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.
\[12]And it was told king David, saying, The LORD has blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.
\[13]And it was so, that when they that bore the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatted calves.
\[14]And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.
\[15]So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
\[16]And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.
\[17]And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the middle of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
\[18]And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.
\[19]And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.
\[20]Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!
\[21]And David said to Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before your father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.
\[22]And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in my own sight: and of the maidservants which you have spoken of, of them shall I be had in honor.
\[23]Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.

nd it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;
\[2]That the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.
\[3]And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in your heart; for the LORD is with you.
\[4]And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying,
\[5]Go and tell my servant David, Thus said the LORD, Shall you build me an house for me to dwell in?
\[6]Whereas I have not dwelled in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.
\[7]In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build you not me an house of cedar?
\[8]Now therefore so shall you say to my servant David, Thus said the LORD of hosts, I took you from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:
\[9]And I was with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies out of your sight, and have made you a great name, like to the name of the great men that are in the earth.
\[10]Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,
\[11]And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused you to rest from all your enemies. Also the LORD tells you that he will make you an house.
\[12]And when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
\[13]He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
\[14]I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:
\[15]But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you.
\[16]And your house and your kingdom shall be established for ever before you: your throne shall be established for ever.
\[17]According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.
\[18]Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that you have brought me till now?
\[19]And this was yet a small thing in your sight, O Lord GOD; but you have spoken also of your servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?
\[20]And what can David say more to you? for you, Lord GOD, know your servant.
\[21]For your word's sake, and according to your own heart, have you done all these great things, to make your servant know them.
\[22]Why you are great, O LORD God: for there is none like you, neither is there any God beside you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
\[23]And what one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for your land, before your people, which you redeemed to you from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?
\[24]For you have confirmed to yourself your people Israel to be a people to you for ever: and you, LORD, are become their God.
\[25]And now, O LORD God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as you have said.
\[26]And let your name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of your servant David be established before you.
\[27]For you, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, I will build you an house: therefore has your servant found in his heart to pray this prayer to you.
\[28]And now, O Lord GOD, you are that God, and your words be true, and you have promised this goodness to your servant:
\[29]Therefore now let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue for ever before you: for you, O Lord GOD, have spoken it: and with your blessing let the house of your servant be blessed for ever.

nd after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines.
\[2]And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.
\[3]David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.
\[4]And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.
\[5]And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
\[6]Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went.
\[7]And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
\[8]And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.
\[9]When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,
\[10]Then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:
\[11]Which also king David did dedicate to the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;
\[12]Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
\[13]And David got him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.
\[14]And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went.
\[15]And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice to all his people.
\[16]And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
\[17]And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;
\[18]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.

\[2]And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him to David, the king said to him, Are you Ziba?  And he said, Your servant is he.
\[3]And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him? And Ziba said to the king, Jonathan has yet a son, which is lame on his feet.
\[4]And the king said to him, Where is he? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.
\[5]Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.
\[6]Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come to David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold your servant!
\[7]And David said to him, Fear not: for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father's sake, and will restore you all the land of Saul your father; and you shall eat bread at my table continually.
\[8]And he bowed himself, and said, What is your servant, that you should look on such a dead dog as I am?
\[9]Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, I have given to your master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.
\[10]You therefore, and your sons, and your servants, shall till the land for him, and you shall bring in the fruits, that your master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth your master's son shall eat bread always at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
\[11]Then said Ziba to the king, According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant, so shall your servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.
\[12]And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelled in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.
\[13]So Mephibosheth dwelled in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.

nd it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
\[2]Then said David, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
\[3]And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Think you that David does honor your father, that he has sent comforters to you? has not David rather sent his servants to you, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
\[4]Why Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
\[5]When they told it to David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
\[6]And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.
\[7]And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
\[8]And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.
\[9]When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:
\[10]And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.
\[11]And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then you shall help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for you, then I will come and help you.
\[12]Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seems him good.
\[13]And Joab drew near, and the people that were with him, to the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.
\[14]And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
\[15]And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together.
\[16]And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.
\[17]And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
\[18]And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.
\[19]And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.

nd it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.
\[2]And it came to pass in an evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked on the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look on.
\[3]And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
\[4]And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned to her house.
\[5]And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child.
\[6]And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.
\[7]And when Uriah was come to him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.
\[8]And David said to Uriah, Go down to your house, and wash your feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king.
\[9]But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
\[10]And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down to his house, David said to Uriah, Came you not from your journey? why then did you not go down to your house?
\[11]And Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.
\[12]And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let you depart. So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.
\[13]And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.
\[14]And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
\[15]And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set you Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire you from him, that he may be smitten, and die.
\[16]And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew that valiant men were.
\[17]And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.
\[18]Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
\[19]And charged the messenger, saying, When you have made an end of telling the matters of the war to the king,
\[20]And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say to you, Why approached you so near to the city when you did fight? knew you not that they would shoot from the wall?
\[21]Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone on him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went you near the wall? then say you, Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
\[22]So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.
\[23]And the messenger said to David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entering of the gate.
\[24]And the shooters shot from off the wall on your servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
\[25]Then David said to the messenger, Thus shall you say to Joab, Let not this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another: make your battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage you him.
\[26]And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.
\[27]And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.

nd the LORD sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
\[2]The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:
\[3]But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.
\[4]And there came a travelers to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come to him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
\[5]And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD lives, the man that has done this thing shall surely die:
\[6]And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
\[7]And Nathan said to David, You are the man. Thus said the LORD God of Israel, I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul;
\[8]And I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given to you such and such things.
\[9]Why have you despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? you have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
\[10]Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house; because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.
\[11]Thus said the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house, and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
\[12]For you did it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
\[13]And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said to David, The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die.
\[14]However,, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born to you shall surely die.
\[15]And Nathan departed to his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and it was very sick.
\[16]David therefore sought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth.
\[17]And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
\[18]And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not listen to our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?
\[19]But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
\[20]Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.
\[21]Then said his servants to him, What thing is this that you have done? you did fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, you did rise and eat bread.
\[22]And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?
\[23]But now he is dead, why should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
\[24]And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her: and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.
\[25]And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.
\[26]And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
\[27]And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.
\[28]Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
\[29]And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
\[30]And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
\[31]And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he to all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

nd it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
\[2]And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her.
\[3]But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtle man.
\[4]And he said to him, Why are you, being the king's son, lean from day to day? will you not tell me? And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
\[5]And Jonadab said to him, Lay you down on your bed, and make yourself sick: and when your father comes to see you, say to him, I pray you, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.
\[6]So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said to the king, I pray you, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.
\[7]Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat.
\[8]So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.
\[9]And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.
\[10]And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of your hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
\[11]And when she had brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come lie with me, my sister.
\[12]And she answered him, No, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not you this folly.
\[13]And I, where shall I cause my shame to go? and as for you, you shall be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray you, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.
\[14]However, he would not listen to her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.
\[15]Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.
\[16]And she said to him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me. But he would not listen to her.
\[17]Then he called his servant that ministered to him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.
\[18]And she had a garment of divers colors on her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins appareled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
\[19]And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.
\[20]And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? but hold now your peace, my sister: he is your brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
\[21]But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
\[22]And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
\[23]And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep shearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
\[24]And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, your servant has sheep shearers; let the king, I beseech you, and his servants go with your servant.
\[25]And the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable to you. And he pressed him: however, he would not go, but blessed him.
\[26]Then said Absalom, If not, I pray you, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with you?
\[27]But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
\[28]Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark you now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.
\[29]And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded.  Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got him up on his mule, and fled.
\[30]And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.
\[31]Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.
\[32]And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
\[33]Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.
\[34]But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.
\[35]And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as your servant said, so it is.
\[36]And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
\[37]But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.
\[38]So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
\[39]And the soul of king David longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

ow Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.
\[2]And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched there a wise woman, and said to her, I pray you, feign yourself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not yourself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:
\[3]And come to the king, and speak on this manner to him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.
\[4]And when the woman of Tekoah spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.
\[5]And the king said to her, What ails you? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and my husband is dead.
\[6]And your handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.
\[7]And, behold, the whole family is risen against your handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the earth.
\[8]And the king said to the woman, Go to your house, and I will give charge concerning you.
\[9]And the woman of Tekoah said to the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.
\[10]And the king said, Whoever said ought to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you any more.
\[11]Then said she, I pray you, let the king remember the LORD your God, that you would not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of your son fall to the earth.
\[12]Then the woman said, Let your handmaid, I pray you, speak one word to my lord the king. And he said, Say on.
\[13]And the woman said, Why then have you thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king does speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king does not fetch home again his banished.
\[14]For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither does God respect any person: yet does he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.
\[15]Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and your handmaid said, I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.
\[16]For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
\[17]Then your handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD your God will be with you.
\[18]Then the king answered and said to the woman, Hide not from me, I pray you, the thing that I shall ask you. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.
\[19]And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with you in all this?  And the woman answered and said, As your soul lives, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king has spoken: for your servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid:
\[20]To fetch about this form of speech has your servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
\[21]And the king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.
\[22]And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day your servant knows that I have found grace in your sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has fulfilled the request of his servant.
\[23]So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
\[24]And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.
\[25]But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
\[26]And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.
\[27]And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.
\[28]So Absalom dwelled two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.
\[29]Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.
\[30]Therefore he said to his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
\[31]Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said to him, Why have your servants set my field on fire?
\[32]And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, Why am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.
\[33]So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.

nd it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
\[2]And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city are you? And he said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
\[3]And Absalom said to him, See, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear you.
\[4]Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!
\[5]And it was so, that when any man came near to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
\[6]And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
\[7]And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said to the king, I pray you, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron.
\[8]For your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.
\[9]And the king said to him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.
\[10]But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, Absalom reigns in Hebron.
\[11]And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.
\[12]And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
\[13]And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
\[14]And David said to all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil on us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
\[15]And the king's servants said to the king, Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king shall appoint.
\[16]And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.
\[17]And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.
\[18]And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
\[19]Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why go you also with us? return to your place, and abide with the king: for you are a stranger, and also an exile.
\[20]Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us? seeing I go where I may, return you, and take back your brothers: mercy and truth be with you.
\[21]And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will your servant be.
\[22]And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.
\[23]And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
\[24]And see Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
\[25]And the king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:
\[26]But if he thus say, I have no delight in you; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seems good to him.
\[27]The king said also to Zadok the priest, Are not you a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
\[28]See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.
\[29]Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
\[30]And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
\[31]And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray you, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
\[32]And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth on his head:
\[33]To whom David said, If you pass on with me, then you shall be a burden to me:
\[34]But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant till now, so will I now also be your servant: then may you for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.
\[35]And have you not there with you Zadok and Abiathar the priests?  therefore it shall be, that what thing soever you shall hear out of the king's house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
\[36]Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them you shall send to me every thing that you can hear.
\[37]So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.

nd when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
\[2]And the king said to Ziba, What mean you by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.
\[3]And the king said, And where is your master's son? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he stays at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.
\[4]Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, your are all that pertained to Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech you that I may find grace in your sight, my lord, O king.
\[5]And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.
\[6]And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
\[7]And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, you bloody man, and you man of Belial:
\[8]The LORD has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead you have reigned; and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son: and, behold, you are taken in your mischief, because you are a bloody man.
\[9]Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray you, and take off his head.
\[10]And the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah?  so let him curse, because the LORD has said to him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Why have you done so?
\[11]And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeks my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD has bidden him.
\[12]It may be that the LORD will look on my affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.
\[13]And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
\[14]And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.
\[15]And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
\[16]And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.
\[17]And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend? why went you not with your friend?
\[18]And Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.
\[19]And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in your father's presence, so will I be in your presence.
\[20]Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.
\[21]And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father's concubines, which he has left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that you are abhorred of your father: then shall the hands of all that are with you be strong.
\[22]So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
\[23]And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counceled in those days, was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.

oreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:
\[2]And I will come on him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:
\[3]And I will bring back all the people to you: the man whom you seek is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.
\[4]And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
\[5]Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he said.
\[6]And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak you.
\[7]And Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good at this time.
\[8]For, said Hushai, you know your father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
\[9]Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.
\[10]And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.
\[11]Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.
\[12]So shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.
\[13]Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.
\[14]And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil on Absalom.
\[15]Then said Hushai to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counceled.
\[16]Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.
\[17]Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.
\[18]Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; where they went down.
\[19]And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.
\[20]And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
\[21]And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said to David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus has Ahithophel counceled against you.
\[22]Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.
\[23]And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and got him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulcher of his father.
\[24]Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
\[25]And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.
\[26]So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.
\[27]And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
\[28]Brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and parched vegetables,
\[29]And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of cows, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.

nd David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.
\[2]And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
\[3]But the people answered, You shall not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now you are worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that you succor us out of the city.
\[4]And the king said to them, What seems you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.
\[5]And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
\[6]So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;
\[7]Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.
\[8]For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
\[9]And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode on a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.
\[10]And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.
\[11]And Joab said to the man that told him, And, behold, you saw him, and why did you not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given you ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.
\[12]And the man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.
\[13]Otherwise I should have worked falsehood against my own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and you yourself would have set yourself against me.
\[14]Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with you. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the middle of the oak.
\[15]And ten young men that bore Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.
\[16]And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.
\[17]And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones on him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.
\[18]Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called to this day, Absalom's place.
\[19]Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD has avenged him of his enemies.
\[20]And Joab said to him, You shall not bear tidings this day, but you shall bear tidings another day: but this day you shall bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.
\[21]Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what you have seen. And Cushi bowed himself to Joab, and ran.
\[22]Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray you, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Why will you run, my son, seeing that you have no tidings ready?
\[23]But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said to him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.
\[24]And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.
\[25]And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.
\[26]And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called to the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also brings tidings.
\[27]And the watchman said, Me thinks the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and comes with good tidings.
\[28]And Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth on his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD your God, which has delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
\[29]And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.
\[30]And the king said to him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.
\[31]And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD has avenged you this day of all them that rose up against you.
\[32]And the king said to Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against you to do you hurt, be as that young man is.
\[33]And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for you, O Absalom, my son, my son!

nd it was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.
\[2]And the victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.
\[3]And the people got them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
\[4]But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!
\[5]And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants, which this day have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;
\[6]In that you love your enemies, and hate your friends. For you have declared this day, that you regard neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased you well.
\[7]Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably to your servants: for I swear by the LORD, if you go not forth, there will not tarry one with you this night: and that will be worse to you than all the evil that befell you from your youth until now.
\[8]Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told to all the people, saying, Behold, the king does sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.
\[9]And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.
\[10]And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak you not a word of bringing the king back?
\[11]And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.
\[12]You are my brothers, you are my bones and my flesh: why then are you the last to bring back the king?
\[13]And say you to Amasa, Are you not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.
\[14]And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word to the king, Return you, and all your servants.
\[15]So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.
\[16]And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
\[17]And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.
\[18]And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;
\[19]And said to the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity to me, neither do you remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.
\[20]For your servant does know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.
\[21]But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed?
\[22]And David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be adversaries to me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?
\[23]Therefore the king said to Shimei, You shall not die. And the king swore to him.
\[24]And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.
\[25]And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why went not you with me, Mephibosheth?
\[26]And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for your servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because your servant is lame.
\[27]And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in your eyes.
\[28]For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet did you set your servant among them that did eat at your own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more to the king?
\[29]And the king said to him, Why speak you any more of your matters? I have said, You and Ziba divide the land.
\[30]And Mephibosheth said to the king, Yes, let him take all, for as much as my lord the king is come again in peace to his own house.
\[31]And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.
\[32]Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.
\[33]And the king said to Barzillai, Come you over with me, and I will feed you with me in Jerusalem.
\[34]And Barzillai said to the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
\[35]I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? why then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?
\[36]Your servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
\[37]Let your servant, I pray you, turn back again, that I may die in my own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.
\[38]And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you: and whatever you shall require of me, that will I do for you.
\[39]And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place.
\[40]Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.
\[41]And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?
\[42]And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: why then be you angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or has he given us any gift?
\[43]And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than you: why then did you despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.

nd there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.
\[2]So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah joined to their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.
\[3]And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.
\[4]Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be you here present.
\[5]So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
\[6]And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take you your lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.
\[7]And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
\[8]When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded to him, and on it a girdle with a sword fastened on his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.
\[9]And Joab said to Amasa, Are you in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.
\[10]But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
\[11]And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favors Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.
\[12]And Amasa wallowed in blood in the middle of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth on him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.
\[13]When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
\[14]And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.
\[15]And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
\[16]Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, to Joab, Come near here, that I may speak with you.
\[17]And when he was come near to her, the woman said, Are you Joab?  And he answered, I am he. Then she said to him, Hear the words of your handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.
\[18]Then she spoke, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.
\[19]I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why will you swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?
\[20]And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.
\[21]The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.
\[22]Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
\[23]Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:
\[24]And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:
\[25]And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:
\[26]And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.

hen there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.
\[2]And the king called the Gibeonites, and said to them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn to them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)
\[3]Why David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?  and with which shall I make the atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of the LORD?
\[4]And the Gibeonites said to him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shall you kill any man in Israel. And he said, What you shall say, that will I do for you.
\[5]And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,
\[6]Let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.
\[7]But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
\[8]But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
\[9]And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.
\[10]And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped on them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
\[11]And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
\[12]And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:
\[13]And he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
\[14]And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulcher of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.
\[15]Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.
\[16]And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.
\[17]But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, You shall go no more out with us to battle, that you quench not the light of Israel.
\[18]And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.
\[19]And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
\[20]And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
\[21]And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.
\[22]These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

nd David spoke to the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:
\[2]And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
\[3]The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my savior; you save me from violence.
\[4]I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies.
\[5]When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;
\[6]The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;
\[7]In my distress I called on the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.
\[8]Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.
\[9]There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
\[10]He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.
\[11]And he rode on a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen on the wings of the wind.
\[12]And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.
\[13]Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.
\[14]The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.
\[15]And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.
\[16]And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
\[17]He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
\[18]He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.
\[19]They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.
\[20]He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
\[21]The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me.
\[22]For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
\[23]For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.
\[24]I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from my iniquity.
\[25]Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.
\[26]With the merciful you will show yourself merciful, and with the upright man you will show yourself upright.
\[27]With the pure you will show yourself pure; and with the fraudulent you will show yourself unsavory.
\[28]And the afflicted people you will save: but your eyes are on the haughty, that you may bring them down.
\[29]For you are my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.
\[30]For by you I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.
\[31]As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.
\[32]For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?
\[33]God is my strength and power: and he makes my way perfect.
\[34]He makes my feet like hinds' feet: and sets me on my high places.
\[35]He teaches my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms.
\[36]You have also given me the shield of your salvation: and your gentleness has made me great.
\[37]You have enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.
\[38]I have pursued my enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.
\[39]And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yes, they are fallen under my feet.
\[40]For you have girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me have you subdued under me.
\[41]You have also given me the necks of my enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.
\[42]They looked, but there was none to save; even to the LORD, but he answered them not.
\[43]Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.
\[44]You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people, you have kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.
\[45]Strangers shall submit themselves to me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient to me.
\[46]Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.
\[47]The LORD lives; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.
\[48]It is God that avenges me, and that brings down the people under me.
\[49]And that brings me forth from my enemies: you also have lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: you have delivered me from the violent man.
\[50]Therefore I will give thanks to you, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises to your name.
\[51]He is the tower of salvation for his king: and shows mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for ever more.

ow these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,
\[2]The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, and his word was in my tongue.
\[3]The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, He that rules over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.
\[4]And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun rises, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.
\[5]Although my house be not so with God; yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.
\[6]But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:
\[7]But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.
\[8]These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.
\[9]And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:
\[10]He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand stuck to the sword: and the LORD worked a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.
\[11]And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentils: and the people fled from the Philistines.
\[12]But he stood in the middle of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD worked a great victory.
\[13]And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.
\[14]And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
\[15]And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
\[16]And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out to the LORD.
\[17]And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.
\[18]And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.
\[19]Was he not most honorable of three? therefore he was their captain: however, he attained not to the first three.
\[20]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lion like men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the middle of a pit in time of snow:
\[21]And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
\[22]These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.
\[23]He was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.
\[24]Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
\[25]Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
\[26]Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
\[27]Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
\[28]Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
\[29]Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,
\[30]Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,
\[31]Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
\[32]Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,

\[34]Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,

nd again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.
\[2]For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number you the people, that I may know the number of the people.
\[3]And Joab said to the king, Now the LORD your God add to the people, how many soever they be, an hundred times, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?
\[4]Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
\[5]And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lies in the middle of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:
\[6]Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,
\[7]And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba.
\[8]So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
\[9]And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
\[10]And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people.  And David said to the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech you, O LORD, take away the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.
\[11]For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
\[12]Go and say to David, Thus said the LORD, I offer you three things; choose you one of them, that I may do it to you.
\[13]So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? or will you flee three months before your enemies, while they pursue you? or that there be three days' pestilence in your land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
\[14]And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.
\[15]So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.
\[16]And when the angel stretched out his hand on Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now your hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing place of Araunah the Jebusite.
\[17]And David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, See, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let your hand, I pray you, be against me, and against my father's house.
\[18]And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, raise an altar to the LORD in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
\[19]And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.
\[20]And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face on the ground.
\[21]And Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant?  And David said, To buy the threshing floor of you, to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
\[22]And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.
\[23]All these things did Araunah, as a king, give to the king. And Araunah said to the king, The LORD your God accept you.
\[24]And the king said to Araunah, No; but I will surely buy it of you at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God of that which does cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
\[25]And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

ow king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat.
\[2]Why his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.
\[3]So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
\[4]And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.
\[5]Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
\[6]And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why have you done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bore him after Absalom.
\[7]And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.
\[8]But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
\[9]And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brothers the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:
\[10]But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
\[11]Why Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith does reign, and David our lord knows it not?
\[12]Now therefore come, let me, I pray you, give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon.
\[13]Go and get you in to king David, and say to him, Did not you, my lord, O king, swear to your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? why then does Adonijah reign?
\[14]Behold, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after you, and confirm your words.
\[15]And Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered to the king.
\[16]And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What would you?
\[17]And she said to him, My lord, you swore by the LORD your God to your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.
\[18]And now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and now, my lord the king, you know it not:
\[19]And he has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon your servant has he not called.
\[20]And you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
\[21]Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.
\[22]And, see, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
\[23]And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
\[24]And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?
\[25]For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.
\[26]But me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon, has he not called.
\[27]Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you have not showed it to your servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
\[28]Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
\[29]And the king swore, and said, As the LORD lives, that has redeemed my soul out of all distress,
\[30]Even as I swore to you by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.
\[31]Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
\[32]And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
\[33]The king also said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:
\[34]And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow you with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.
\[35]Then you shall come up after him, that he may come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
\[36]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.
\[37]As the LORD has been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
\[38]So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.
\[39]And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.
\[40]And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
\[41]And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?
\[42]And while he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said to him, Come in; for you are a valiant man, and bring good tidings.
\[43]And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Truly our lord king David has made Solomon king.
\[44]And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride on the king's mule:
\[45]And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that you have heard.
\[46]And also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.
\[47]And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne. And the king bowed himself on the bed.
\[48]And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which has given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.
\[49]And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.
\[50]And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
\[51]And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon: for, see, he has caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.
\[52]And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.
\[53]So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said to him, Go to your house.

ow the days of David drew near that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
\[2]I go the way of all the earth: be you strong therefore, and show yourself a man;
\[3]And keep the charge of the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do, and wherever you turn yourself:
\[4]That the LORD may continue his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If your children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
\[5]Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.
\[6]Do therefore according to your wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.
\[7]But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at your table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom your brother.
\[8]And, behold, you have with you Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put you to death with the sword.
\[9]Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for you are a wise man, and know what you ought to do to him; but his hoar head bring you down to the grave with blood.
\[10]So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
\[11]And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
\[12]Then sat Solomon on the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
\[13]And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Come you peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.
\[14]He said moreover, I have somewhat to say to you. And she said, Say on.
\[15]And he said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: however, the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.
\[16]And now I ask one petition of you, deny me not. And she said to him, Say on.
\[17]And he said, Speak, I pray you, to Solomon the king, (for he will not say you no,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.
\[18]And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for you to the king.
\[19]Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.
\[20]Then she said, I desire one small petition of you; I pray you, say me not no. And the king said to her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say you no.
\[21]And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother to wife.
\[22]And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
\[23]Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.
\[24]Now therefore, as the LORD lives, which has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
\[25]And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell on him that he died.
\[26]And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because you have been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
\[27]So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to the LORD; that he might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
\[28]Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
\[29]And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled to the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall on him.
\[30]And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said to him, Thus said the king, Come forth. And he said, No; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
\[31]And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him; that you may take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.
\[32]And the LORD shall return his blood on his own head, who fell on two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
\[33]Their blood shall therefore return on the head of Joab, and on the head of his seed for ever: but on David, and on his seed, and on his house, and on his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.
\[34]So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell on him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
\[35]And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
\[36]And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build you an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth there any where.
\[37]For it shall be, that on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, you shall know for certain that you shall surely die: your blood shall be on your own head.
\[38]And Shimei said to the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do. And Shimei dwelled in Jerusalem many days.
\[39]And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants be in Gath.
\[40]And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.
\[41]And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.
\[42]And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make you to swear by the LORD, and protested to you, saying, Know for a certain, on the day you go out, and walk abroad any where, that you shall surely die? and you said to me, The word that I have heard is good.
\[43]Why then have you not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged you with?
\[44]The king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to, that you did to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return your wickedness on your own head;
\[45]And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.
\[46]So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell on him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.

nd Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
\[2]Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built to the name of the LORD, until those days.
\[3]And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.
\[4]And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer on that altar.
\[5]In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give you.
\[6]And Solomon said, You have showed to your servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you; and you have kept for him this great kindness, that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.
\[7]And now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.
\[8]And your servant is in the middle of your people which you have chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
\[9]Give therefore your servant an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this your so great a people?
\[10]And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.
\[11]And God said to him, Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life; neither have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies; but have asked for yourself understanding to discern judgment;
\[12]Behold, I have done according to your words: see, I have given you a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like you before you, neither after you shall any arise like to you.
\[13]And I have also given you that which you have not asked, both riches, and honor: so that there shall not be any among the kings like to you all your days.
\[14]And if you will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as your father David did walk, then I will lengthen your days.
\[15]And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
\[16]Then came there two women, that were harlots, to the king, and stood before him.
\[17]And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
\[18]And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
\[19]And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
\[20]And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while your handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
\[21]And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.
\[22]And the other woman said, No; but the living is my son, and the dead is your son. And this said, No; but the dead is your son, and the living is my son. Thus they spoke before the king.
\[23]Then said the king, The one said, This is my son that lives, and your son is the dead: and the other said, No; but your son is the dead, and my son is the living.
\[24]And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
\[25]And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
\[26]Then spoke the woman whose the living child was to the king, for her bowels yearned on her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither my nor yours, but divide it.
\[27]Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.
\[28]And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.

\[2]And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,
\[3]Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.
\[4]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:
\[5]And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:
\[6]And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.
\[7]And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.
\[8]And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:
\[9]The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan:
\[10]The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:
\[11]The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
\[12]Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even to the place that is beyond Jokneam:
\[13]The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, three score great cities with walls and brazen bars:
\[14]Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:
\[15]Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
\[16]Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:
\[17]Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:
\[18]Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:
\[19]Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.
\[20]Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.
\[21]And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
\[22]And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and three score measures of meal,
\[23]Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow deer, and fatted fowl.
\[24]For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.
\[25]And Judah and Israel dwelled safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.
\[26]And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
\[27]And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came to king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.
\[28]Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they to the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.
\[29]And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.
\[30]And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
\[31]For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.
\[32]And he spoke three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.
\[33]And he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall: he spoke also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.

nd Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
\[2]And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
\[3]You know how that David my father could not build an house to the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
\[4]But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil result.
\[5]And, behold, I purpose to build an house to the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to David my father, saying, Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your room, he shall build an house to my name.
\[6]Now therefore command you that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with your servants: and to you will I give hire for your servants according to all that you shall appoint: for you know that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like to the Sidonians.
\[7]And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which has given to David a wise son over this great people.
\[8]And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which you sent to me for: and I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
\[9]My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats to the place that you shall appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and you shall receive them: and you shall accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.
\[10]So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.
\[11]And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
\[12]And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.
\[13]And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
\[14]And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.
\[15]And Solomon had three score and ten thousand that bore burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;
\[16]Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that worked in the work.
\[17]And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.
\[18]And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stone squarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.

nd it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.
\[2]And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was three score cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.
\[3]And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.
\[4]And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
\[5]And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:
\[6]The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.
\[7]And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
\[8]The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.
\[9]So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.
\[10]And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
\[11]And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,
\[12]Concerning this house which you are in building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with you, which I spoke to David your father:
\[13]And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
\[14]So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
\[15]And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.
\[16]And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.
\[17]And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.
\[18]And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
\[19]And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
\[20]And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.
\[21]So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.
\[22]And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.
\[23]And within the oracle he made two cherubim of olive tree, each ten cubits high.
\[24]And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.
\[25]And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one size.
\[26]The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.
\[27]And he set the cherubim within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the middle of the house.
\[28]And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
\[29]And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.
\[30]And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
\[31]And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.
\[32]The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold on the cherubim, and on the palm trees.
\[33]So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.
\[34]And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
\[35]And he carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted on the carved work.
\[36]And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.
\[37]In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:
\[38]And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.

\[2]He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.
\[3]And it was covered with cedar above on the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.
\[4]And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.
\[5]And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.
\[6]And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.
\[7]Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.
\[8]And his house where he dwelled had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like to this porch.
\[9]All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.
\[10]And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
\[11]And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.
\[12]And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.
\[13]And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
\[14]He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and worked all his work.
\[15]For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.
\[16]And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits:
\[17]And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.
\[18]And he made the pillars, and two rows round about on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other capital.
\[19]And the capitals that were on the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.
\[20]And the capitals on the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about on the other capital.
\[21]And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.
\[22]And on the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
\[23]And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
\[24]And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.
\[25]It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above on them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
\[26]And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was worked like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.
\[27]And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.
\[28]And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:
\[29]And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim: and on the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.
\[30]And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had supports: under the laver were supports molten, at the side of every addition.
\[31]And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also on the mouth of it were engravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.
\[32]And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.
\[33]And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.
\[34]And there were four supports to the four corners of one base: and the supports were of the very base itself.
\[35]And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.
\[36]For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.
\[37]After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.
\[38]Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and on every one of the ten bases one laver.
\[39]And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.
\[40]And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:
\[41]The two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;
\[42]And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;
\[43]And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;
\[44]And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
\[45]And the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.
\[46]In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.
\[47]And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.
\[48]And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained to the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the show bread was,
\[49]And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,
\[50]And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.
\[51]So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.

hen Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
\[2]And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
\[3]And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
\[4]And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.
\[5]And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
\[6]And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.
\[7]For the cherubim spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
\[8]And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are to this day.
\[9]There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
\[10]And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,
\[11]So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.
\[12]Then spoke Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
\[13]I have surely built you an house to dwell in, a settled place for you to abide in for ever.
\[14]And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)
\[15]And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hand fulfilled it, saying,
\[16]Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.
\[17]And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
\[18]And the LORD said to David my father, Whereas it was in your heart to build an house to my name, you did well that it was in your heart.
\[19]Nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son that shall come forth out of your loins, he shall build the house to my name.
\[20]And the LORD has performed his word that he spoke, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
\[21]And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
\[22]And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:
\[23]And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keep covenant and mercy with your servants that walk before you with all their heart:
\[24]Who have kept with your servant David my father that you promised him: you spoke also with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.
\[25]Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that you promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that your children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as you have walked before me.
\[26]And now, O God of Israel, let your word, I pray you, be verified, which you spoke to your servant David my father.
\[27]But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built?
\[28]Yet have you respect to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer, which your servant prays before you to day:
\[29]That your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which you have said, My name shall be there: that you may listen to the prayer which your servant shall make toward this place.
\[30]And listen you to the supplication of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear you in heaven your dwelling place: and when you hear, forgive.
\[31]If any man trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid on him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before your altar in this house:
\[32]Then hear you in heaven, and do, and judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way on his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
\[33]When your people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you, and shall turn again to you, and confess your name, and pray, and make supplication to you in this house:
\[34]Then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fathers.
\[35]When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you afflict them:
\[36]Then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, that you teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance.
\[37]If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever plague, whatever sickness there be;
\[38]What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all your people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:
\[39]Then hear you in heaven your dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the hearts of all the children of men;)
\[40]That they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave to our fathers.
\[41]Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of your people Israel, but comes out of a far country for your name's sake;
\[42](For they shall hear of your great name, and of your strong hand, and of your stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;
\[43]Hear you in heaven your dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calls to you for: that all people of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as do your people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have built, is called by your name.
\[44]If your people go out to battle against their enemy, wherever you shall send them, and shall pray to the LORD toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house that I have built for your name:
\[45]Then hear you in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
\[46]If they sin against you, (for there is no man that sins not,) and you be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives to the land of the enemy, far or near;
\[47]Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land where they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication to you in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;
\[48]And so return to you with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name:
\[49]Then hear you their prayer and their supplication in heaven your dwelling place, and maintain their cause,
\[50]And forgive your people that have sinned against you, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against you, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:
\[51]For they be your people, and your inheritance, which you brought forth out of Egypt, from the middle of the furnace of iron:
\[52]That your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant, and to the supplication of your people Israel, to listen to them in all that they call for to you.
\[53]For you did separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be your inheritance, as you spoke by the hand of Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God.
\[54]And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.
\[55]And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
\[56]Blessed be the LORD, that has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there has not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.
\[57]The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:
\[58]That he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.
\[59]And let these my words, with which I have made supplication before the LORD, be near to the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:
\[60]That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.
\[61]Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.
\[62]And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.
\[63]And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.
\[64]The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.
\[65]And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.
\[66]On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.

nd it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,
\[2]That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.
\[3]And the LORD said to him, I have heard your prayer and your supplication, that you have made before me: I have hallowed this house, which you have built, to put my name there for ever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
\[4]And if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my judgments:
\[5]Then I will establish the throne of your kingdom on Israel for ever, as I promised to David your father, saying, There shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel.
\[6]But if you shall at all turn from following me, you or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:
\[7]Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:
\[8]And at this house, which is high, every one that passes by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why has the LORD done thus to this land, and to this house?
\[9]And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold on other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore has the LORD brought on them all this evil.
\[10]And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,
\[11](Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
\[12]And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.
\[13]And he said, What cities are these which you have given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul to this day.
\[14]And Hiram sent to the king six score talents of gold.
\[15]And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
\[16]For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelled in the city, and given it for a present to his daughter, Solomon's wife.
\[17]And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,
\[18]And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,
\[19]And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
\[20]And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,
\[21]Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, on those did Solomon levy a tribute of slavery to this day.
\[22]But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no slaves: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.
\[23]These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bore rule over the people that worked in the work.
\[24]But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.
\[25]And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to the LORD, and he burnt incense on the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.
\[26]And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.
\[27]And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
\[28]And they came to Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.

nd when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.
\[2]And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
\[3]And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.
\[4]And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,
\[5]And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
\[6]And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts and of your wisdom.
\[7]However, I believed not the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: your wisdom and prosperity exceeds the fame which I heard.
\[8]Happy are your men, happy are these your servants, which stand continually before you, and that hear your wisdom.
\[9]Blessed be the LORD your God, which delighted in you, to set you on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he you king, to do judgment and justice.
\[10]And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
\[11]And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.
\[12]And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen to this day.
\[13]And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty.  So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.
\[14]Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred three score and six talents of gold,
\[15]Beside that he had of the merchants, and of the traffic of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
\[16]And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.
\[17]And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
\[18]Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.
\[19]The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.
\[20]And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
\[21]And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
\[22]For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
\[23]So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
\[24]And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
\[25]And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
\[26]And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\[27]And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.
\[28]And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
\[29]And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.

ut king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:
\[2]Of the nations concerning which the LORD said to the children of Israel, You shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in to you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon joined to these in love.
\[3]And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.
\[4]For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.
\[5]For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
\[6]And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did David his father.
\[7]Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.
\[8]And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.
\[9]And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared to him twice,
\[10]And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.
\[11]Why the LORD said to Solomon, For as much as this is done of you, and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely rend the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant.
\[12]Notwithstanding in your days I will not do it for David your father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of your son.
\[13]However, I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to your son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
\[14]And the LORD stirred up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.
\[15]For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;
\[16](For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)
\[17]That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.
\[18]And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.
\[19]And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
\[20]And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.
\[21]And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.
\[22]Then Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked with me, that, behold, you seek to go to your own country? And he answered, Nothing: however, let me go in any wise.
\[23]And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:
\[24]And he gathered men to him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelled therein, and reigned in Damascus.
\[25]And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
\[26]And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.
\[27]And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.
\[28]And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.
\[29]And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:
\[30]And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:
\[31]And he said to Jeroboam, Take you ten pieces: for thus said the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you:
\[32](But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)
\[33]Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.
\[34]However, I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:
\[35]But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it to you, even ten tribes.
\[36]And to his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.
\[37]And I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.
\[38]And it shall be, if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with you, and build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you.
\[39]And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
\[40]Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
\[41]And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
\[42]And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
\[43]And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.

nd Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.
\[2]And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelled in Egypt;)
\[3]That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
\[4]Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.
\[5]And he said to them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.
\[6]And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do you advise that I may answer this people?
\[7]And they spoke to him, saying, If you will be a servant to this people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants for ever.
\[8]But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:
\[9]And he said to them, What counsel give you that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which your father did put on us lighter?
\[10]And the young men that were grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall you speak to this people that spoke to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to us; thus shall you say to them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
\[11]And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father has chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\[12]So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.
\[13]And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;
\[14]And spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\[15]Why the king listened not to the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\[16]So when all Israel saw that the king listened not to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to your own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents.
\[17]But as for the children of Israel which dwelled in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
\[18]Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
\[19]So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.
\[20]And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
\[21]And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
\[22]But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
\[23]Speak to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
\[24]Thus said the LORD, You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They listened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.
\[25]Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelled therein; and went out from there, and built Penuel.
\[26]And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:
\[27]If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.
\[28]Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
\[29]And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.
\[30]And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even to Dan.
\[31]And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.
\[32]And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like to the feast that is in Judah, and he offered on the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.
\[33]So he offered on the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast to the children of Israel: and he offered on the altar, and burnt incense.

nd, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.
\[2]And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus said the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and on you shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense on you, and men's bones shall be burnt on you.
\[3]And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD has spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.
\[4]And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.
\[5]The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
\[6]And the king answered and said to the man of God, Entreat now the face of the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God sought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.
\[7]And the king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.
\[8]And the man of God said to the king, If you will give me half your house, I will not go in with you, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:
\[9]For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that you came.
\[10]So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.
\[11]Now there dwelled an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken to the king, them they told also to their father.
\[12]And their father said to them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.
\[13]And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,
\[14]And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said to him, Are you the man of God that came from Judah? And he said, I am.
\[15]Then he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
\[16]And he said, I may not return with you, nor go in with you: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place:
\[17]For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, You shall eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that you came.
\[18]He said to him, I am a prophet also as you are; and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with you into your house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied to him.
\[19]So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.
\[20]And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet that brought him back:
\[21]And he cried to the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus said the LORD, For as much as you have disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and have not kept the commandment which the LORD your God commanded you,
\[22]But came back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the Lord did say to you, Eat no bread, and drink no water; your carcass shall not come to the sepulcher of your fathers.
\[23]And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.
\[24]And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcass was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcass.
\[25]And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcass: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelled.
\[26]And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient to the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke to him.
\[27]And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.
\[28]And he went and found his carcass cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not eaten the carcass, nor torn the ass.
\[29]And the prophet took up the carcass of the man of God, and laid it on the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.
\[30]And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!
\[31]And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulcher wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:
\[32]For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
\[33]After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.
\[34]And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.

t that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
\[2]And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray you, and disguise yourself, that you be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get you to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.
\[3]And take with you ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell you what shall become of the child.
\[4]And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
\[5]And the LORD said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam comes to ask a thing of you for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shall you say to her: for it shall be, when she comes in, that she shall feign herself to be another woman.
\[6]And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, you wife of Jeroboam; why feign you yourself to be another? for I am sent to you with heavy tidings.
\[7]Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, For as much as I exalted you from among the people, and made you prince over my people Israel,
\[8]And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it you: and yet you have not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in my eyes;
\[9]But have done evil above all that were before you: for you have gone and made you other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back:
\[10]Therefore, behold, I will bring evil on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that urinates against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man takes away dung, till it be all gone.
\[11]Him that dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dies in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD has spoken it.
\[12]Arise you therefore, get you to your own house: and when your feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
\[13]And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.
\[14]Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.
\[15]For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.
\[16]And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.
\[17]And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;
\[18]And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.
\[19]And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
\[20]And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
\[21]And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
\[22]And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.
\[23]For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.
\[24]And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
\[25]And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:
\[26]And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
\[27]And king Rehoboam made in their stead brazen shields, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house.
\[28]And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.
\[29]Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[30]And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.

ow in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.
\[2]Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
\[3]And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.
\[4]Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:
\[5]Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
\[6]And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
\[7]Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
\[8]And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
\[9]And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.
\[10]And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
\[11]And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did David his father.
\[12]And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
\[13]And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.
\[14]But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.
\[15]And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.
\[16]And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
\[17]And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
\[18]Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelled at Damascus, saying,
\[19]There is a league between me and you, and between my father and your father: behold, I have sent to you a present of silver and gold; come and break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
\[20]So Benhadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
\[21]And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelled in Tirzah.
\[22]Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, with which Baasha had built; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
\[23]The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
\[24]And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
\[25]And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.
\[26]And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.
\[27]And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.
\[28]Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.
\[29]And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:
\[30]Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation with which he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.
\[31]Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

hen the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,
\[2]For as much as I exalted you out of the dust, and made you prince over my people Israel; and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;
\[3]Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\[4]Him that dies of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dies of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.
\[5]Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[6]So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.
\[7]And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.
\[8]In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.
\[9]And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.
\[10]And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
\[11]And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that urinates against a wall, neither of his kinfolks, nor of his friends.
\[12]Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet.
\[13]For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
\[14]Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[15]In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
\[16]And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri has conspired, and has also slain the king: why all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.
\[17]And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
\[18]And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died.
\[19]For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.
\[20]Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he worked, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[21]Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.
\[22]But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
\[23]In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.
\[24]And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.
\[25]But Omri worked evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him.
\[26]For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
\[27]Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[28]So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
\[29]And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.
\[30]And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him.
\[31]And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.
\[32]And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
\[33]And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.

\[6]And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
\[7]And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
\[8]And the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
\[9]Arise, get you to Zarephath, which belongs to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain you.
\[10]So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray you, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
\[11]And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray you, a morsel of bread in your hand.
\[12]And she said, As the LORD your God lives, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
\[13]And Elijah said to her, Fear not; go and do as you have said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it to me, and after make for you and for your son.
\[14]For thus said the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sends rain on the earth.
\[15]And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.
\[16]And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Elijah.
\[17]And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
\[18]And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, O you man of God? are you come to me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?
\[19]And he said to her, Give me your son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he stayed, and laid him on his own bed.
\[20]And he cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, have you also brought evil on the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
\[21]And he stretched himself on the child three times, and cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray you, let this child's soul come into him again.
\[22]And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
\[23]And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother: and Elijah said, See, your son lives.
\[24]And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth.

nd it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I will send rain on the earth.
\[2]And Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria.
\[3]And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:
\[4]For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
\[5]And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go into the land, to all fountains of water, and to all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.
\[6]So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
\[7]And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Are you that my lord Elijah?
\[8]And he answered him, I am: go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
\[9]And he said, What have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?
\[10]As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent to seek you: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found you not.
\[11]And now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
\[12]And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry you where I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find you, he shall slay me: but I your servant fear the LORD from my youth.
\[13]Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
\[14]And now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.
\[15]And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him to day.
\[16]So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
\[17]And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Are you he that troubles Israel?
\[18]And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your father's house, in that you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and you have followed Baalim.
\[19]Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.
\[20]So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to mount Carmel.
\[21]And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long halt you between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
\[22]Then said Elijah to the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.
\[23]Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:
\[24]And call you on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answers by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.
\[25]And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for you are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.
\[26]And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped on the altar which was made.
\[27]And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleeps, and must be awaked.
\[28]And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out on them.
\[29]And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
\[30]And Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.
\[31]And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be your name:
\[32]And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
\[33]And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.
\[34]And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time.  And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.
\[35]And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
\[36]And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.
\[37]Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that you are the LORD God, and that you have turned their heart back again.
\[38]Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
\[39]And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.
\[40]And Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
\[41]And Elijah said to Ahab, Get you up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.
\[42]So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees,
\[43]And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.
\[44]And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there rises a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Prepare your chariot, and get you down that the rain stop you not.
\[45]And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.
\[46]And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

nd Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and with how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
\[2]Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not your life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.
\[3]And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.
\[4]But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.
\[5]And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise and eat.
\[6]And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baked on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.
\[7]And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for you.
\[8]And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.
\[9]And he came thither to a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said to him, What do you here, Elijah?
\[10]And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
\[11]And he said, Go forth, and stand on the mount before the LORD.  And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:
\[12]And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
\[13]And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice to him, and said, What do you here, Elijah?
\[14]And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
\[15]And the LORD said to him, Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when you come, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:
\[16]And Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shall you anoint to be prophet in your room.
\[17]And it shall come to pass, that him that escapes the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.
\[18]Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.
\[19]So he departed there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle on him.
\[20]And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray you, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you. And he said to him, Go back again: for what have I done to you?
\[21]And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.

nd Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.
\[2]And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said to him, Thus said Benhadad,
\[3]Your silver and your gold is mine; your wives also and your children, even the best, are mine.
\[4]And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to your saying, I am yours, and all that I have.
\[5]And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaks Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent to you, saying, You shall deliver me your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and your children;
\[6]Yet I will send my servants to you to morrow about this time, and they shall search your house, and the houses of your servants; and it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.
\[7]Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeks mischief: for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.
\[8]And all the elders and all the people said to him, Listen not to him, nor consent.
\[9]Why he said to the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the king, All that you did send for to your servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.
\[10]And Benhadad sent to him, and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.
\[11]And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girds on his harness boast himself as he that puts it off.
\[12]And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said to his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.
\[13]And, behold, there came a prophet to Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus said the LORD, Have you seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into your hand this day; and you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[14]And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus said the LORD, Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, You.
\[15]Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.
\[16]And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.
\[17]And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.
\[18]And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.
\[19]So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.
\[20]And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen.
\[21]And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
\[22]And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said to him, Go, strengthen yourself, and mark, and see what you do: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.
\[23]And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
\[24]And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:
\[25]And number you an army, like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he listened to their voice, and did so.
\[26]And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
\[27]And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.
\[28]And there came a man of God, and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, Thus said the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[29]And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.
\[30]But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell on twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
\[31]And his servants said to him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray you, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save your life.
\[32]So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Your servant Benhadad said, I pray you, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.
\[33]Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Your brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go you, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
\[34]And Ben-hadad said to him, The cities, which my father took from your father, I will restore; and you shall make streets for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send you away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.
\[35]And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray you. And the man refused to smite him.
\[36]Then said he to him, Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as you are departed from me, a lion shall slay you.  And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.
\[37]Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray you. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.
\[38]So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes on his face.
\[39]And as the king passed by, he cried to the king: and he said, Your servant went out into the middle of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall your life be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.
\[40]And as your servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, So shall your judgment be; yourself have decided it.
\[41]And he hurried, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.
\[42]And he said to him, Thus said the LORD, Because you have let go out of your hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.
\[43]And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.

nd it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
\[2]And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near to my house: and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to you, I will give you the worth of it in money.
\[3]And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you.
\[4]And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.
\[5]But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?
\[6]And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it please you, I will give you another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give you my vineyard.
\[7]And Jezebel his wife said to him, Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry: I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
\[8]So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.
\[9]And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:
\[10]And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, You did blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.
\[11]And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.
\[12]They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
\[13]And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.
\[14]Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
\[15]And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
\[16]And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
\[17]And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
\[18]Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he is gone down to possess it.
\[19]And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus said the LORD, Have you killed, and also taken possession? And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus said the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even yours.
\[20]And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found you: because you have sold yourself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.
\[21]Behold, I will bring evil on you, and will take away your posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that urinates against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,
\[22]And will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.
\[23]And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
\[24]Him that dies of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dies in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.
\[25]But there was none like to Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.
\[26]And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
\[27]And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
\[28]And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
\[29]See you how Ahab humbles himself before me? because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil on his house.

\[2]And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
\[3]And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know you that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?
\[4]And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.
\[5]And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray you, at the word of the LORD to day.
\[6]Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
\[7]And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might inquire of him?
\[8]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
\[9]Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten here Micaiah the son of Imlah.
\[10]And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
\[11]And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus said the LORD, With these shall you push the Syrians, until you have consumed them.
\[12]And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king's hand.
\[13]And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth: let your word, I pray you, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.
\[14]And Micaiah said, As the LORD lives, what the LORD said to me, that will I speak.
\[15]So he came to the king. And the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
\[16]And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?
\[17]And he said, I saw all Israel scattered on the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.
\[18]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?
\[19]And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
\[20]And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.
\[21]And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.
\[22]And the LORD said to him, With which? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, You shall persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.
\[23]Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets, and the LORD has spoken evil concerning you.
\[24]But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak to you?
\[25]And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see in that day, when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.
\[26]And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
\[27]And say, Thus said the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.
\[28]And Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me. And he said, Listen, O people, every one of you.
\[29]So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.
\[30]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put you on your robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
\[31]But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
\[32]And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
\[33]And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
\[34]And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: why he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
\[35]And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the middle of the chariot.
\[36]And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.
\[37]So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.
\[38]And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according to the word of the LORD which he spoke.
\[39]Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[40]So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
\[41]And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
\[42]Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
\[43]And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.
\[44]And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
\[45]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[46]And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.
\[47]There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.
\[48]Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.
\[49]Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with your servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
\[50]And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
\[51]Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.
\[52]And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:
\[53]For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.

hen Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
\[2]And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.
\[3]But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?
\[4]Now therefore thus said the LORD, You shall not come down from that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die. And Elijah departed.
\[5]And when the messengers turned back to him, he said to them, Why are you now turned back?
\[6]And they said to him, There came a man up to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn again to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus said the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore you shall not come down from that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die.
\[7]And he said to them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?
\[8]And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
\[9]Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spoke to him, You man of God, the king has said, Come down.
\[10]And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty.  And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
\[11]Again also he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty.  And he answered and said to him, O man of God, thus has the king said, Come down quickly.
\[12]And Elijah answered and said to them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
\[13]And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and sought him, and said to him, O man of God, I pray you, let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants, be precious in your sight.
\[14]Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in your sight.
\[15]And the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king.
\[16]And he said to him, Thus said the LORD, For as much as you have sent messengers to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore you shall not come down off that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die.
\[17]So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken.  And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.
\[18]Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

nd it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
\[2]And Elijah said to Elisha, Tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said to him, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they went down to Bethel.
\[3]And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from your head to day? And he said, Yes, I know it; hold you your peace.
\[4]And Elijah said to him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they came to Jericho.
\[5]And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said to him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from your head to day? And he answered, Yes, I know it; hold you your peace.
\[6]And Elijah said to him, Tarry, I pray you, here; for the LORD has sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And they two went on.
\[7]And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.
\[8]And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided here and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.
\[9]And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I be taken away from you. And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be on me.
\[10]And he said, You have asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so to you; but if not, it shall not be so.
\[11]And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
\[12]And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.
\[13]He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;
\[14]And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted here and thither: and Elisha went over.
\[15]And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
\[16]And they said to him, Behold now, there be with your servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray you, and seek your master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up, and cast him on some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, You shall not send.
\[17]And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.
\[18]And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?
\[19]And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, I pray you, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.
\[20]And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.
\[21]And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus said the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from there any more death or barren land.
\[22]So the waters were healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.
\[23]And he went up from there to Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, you bald head; go up, you bald head.
\[24]And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.
\[25]And he went from there to mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.

ow Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
\[2]And he worked evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.
\[3]Nevertheless he joined to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
\[4]And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep master, and rendered to the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.
\[5]But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
\[6]And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.
\[7]And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: will you go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as you are, my people as your people, and my horses as your horses.
\[8]And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.
\[9]So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.
\[10]And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!
\[11]But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.
\[12]And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
\[13]And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you?  get you to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother.  And the king of Israel said to him, No: for the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
\[14]And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.
\[15]But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came on him.
\[16]And he said, Thus said the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.
\[17]For thus said the LORD, You shall not see wind, neither shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that you may drink, both you, and your cattle, and your beasts.
\[18]And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.
\[19]And you shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.
\[20]And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
\[21]And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood in the border.
\[22]And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:
\[23]And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.
\[24]And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.
\[25]And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; however, the slingers went about it, and smote it.
\[26]And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even to the king of Edom: but they could not.
\[27]Then he took his oldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.

ow there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take to him my two sons to be slaves.
\[2]And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for you? tell me, what have you in the house? And she said, Your handmaid has not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.
\[3]Then he said, Go, borrow you vessels abroad of all your neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.
\[4]And when you are come in, you shall shut the door on you and on your sons, and shall pour out into all those vessels, and you shall set aside that which is full.
\[5]So she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.
\[6]And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.
\[7]Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and live you and your children of the rest.
\[8]And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.
\[9]And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passes by us continually.
\[10]Let us make a little chamber, I pray you, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in thither.
\[11]And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.
\[12]And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.
\[13]And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, you have been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for you? would you be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.
\[14]And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Truly she has no child, and her husband is old.
\[15]And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.
\[16]And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, you shall embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your handmaid.
\[17]And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season that Elisha had said to her, according to the time of life.
\[18]And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.
\[19]And he said to his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.
\[20]And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.
\[21]And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door on him, and went out.
\[22]And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray you, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.
\[23]And he said, Why will you go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.
\[24]Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not your riding for me, except I bid you.
\[25]So she went and came to the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:
\[26]Run now, I pray you, to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with you? is it well with your husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well:
\[27]And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD has hid it from me, and has not told me.
\[28]Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?
\[29]Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute you, answer him not again: and lay my staff on the face of the child.
\[30]And the mother of the child said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And he arose, and followed her.
\[31]And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Why he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.
\[32]And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid on his bed.
\[33]He went in therefore, and shut the door on them two, and prayed to the LORD.
\[34]And he went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands: and stretched himself on the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.
\[35]Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself on him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
\[36]And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in to him, he said, Take up your son.
\[37]Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.
\[38]And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.
\[39]And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.
\[40]So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O you man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.
\[41]But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.
\[42]And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give to the people, that they may eat.
\[43]And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men?  He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus said the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.
\[44]So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD.

ow Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance to Syria: he was also a mighty man in valor, but he was a leper.
\[2]And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.
\[3]And she said to her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.
\[4]And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.
\[5]And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
\[6]And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come to you, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may recover him of his leprosy.
\[7]And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man does send to me to recover a man of his leprosy? why consider, I pray you, and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.
\[8]And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why have you rent your clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
\[9]So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
\[10]And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.
\[11]But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.
\[12]Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.
\[13]And his servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid you do some great thing, would you not have done it? how much rather then, when he said to you, Wash, and be clean?
\[14]Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like to the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
\[15]And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray you, take a blessing of your servant.
\[16]But he said, As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.
\[17]And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray you, be given to your servant two mules' burden of earth? for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD.
\[18]In this thing the LORD pardon your servant, that when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this thing.
\[19]And he said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.
\[20]But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD lives, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.
\[21]So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?
\[22]And he said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray you, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.
\[23]And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them on two of his servants; and they bore them before him.
\[24]And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.
\[25]But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, From where come you, Gehazi? And he said, Your servant went no where.
\[26]And he said to him, Went not my heart with you, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?
\[27]The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall stick to you, and to your seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.

nd the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with you is too strait for us.
\[2]Let us go, we pray you, to Jordan, and take there every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go you.
\[3]And one said, Be content, I pray you, and go with your servants. And he answered, I will go.
\[4]So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.
\[5]But as one was felling a beam, the ax head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.
\[6]And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place.  And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.
\[7]Therefore said he, Take it up to you. And he put out his hand, and took it.
\[8]Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.
\[9]And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that you pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.
\[10]And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.
\[11]Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said to them, Will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?
\[12]And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber.
\[13]And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him.  And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.
\[14]Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.
\[15]And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?
\[16]And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.
\[17]And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray you, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
\[18]And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray you, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
\[19]And Elisha said to them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek. But he led them to Samaria.
\[20]And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the middle of Samaria.
\[21]And the king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?
\[22]And he answered, You shall not smite them: would you smite those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.
\[23]And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
\[24]And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
\[25]And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.
\[26]And as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, there cried a woman to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.
\[27]And he said, If the LORD do not help you, from where shall I help you?  out of the barn floor, or out of the wine press?
\[28]And the king said to her, What ails you? And she answered, This woman said to me, Give your son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.
\[29]So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said to her on the next day, Give your son, that we may eat him: and she has hid her son.
\[30]And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by on the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within on his flesh.
\[31]Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.
\[32]But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See you how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?
\[33]And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down to him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?

hen Elisha said, Hear you the word of the LORD; Thus said the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
\[2]Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?  And he said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat thereof.
\[3]And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?
\[4]If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall to the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.
\[5]And they rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.
\[6]For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, See, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.
\[7]Why they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.
\[8]And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried there silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried there also, and went and hid it.
\[9]Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come on us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.
\[10]So they came and called to the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.
\[11]And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within.
\[12]And the king arose in the night, and said to his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.
\[13]And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray you, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.
\[14]They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.
\[15]And they went after them to Jordan: and, see, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.
\[16]And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.
\[17]And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people stepped on him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.
\[18]And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:
\[19]And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat thereof.
\[20]And so it fell out to him: for the people stepped on him in the gate, and he died.

hen spoke Elisha to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go you and your household, and sojourn wherever you can sojourn: for the LORD has called for a famine; and it shall also come on the land seven years.
\[2]And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
\[3]And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land.
\[4]And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray you, all the great things that Elisha has done.
\[5]And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.
\[6]And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.
\[7]And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come here.
\[8]And the king said to Hazael, Take a present in your hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
\[9]So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Your son Benhadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
\[10]And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, You may certainly recover: however, the LORD has showed me that he shall surely die.
\[11]And he settled his countenance steadfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.
\[12]And Hazael said, Why weeps my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: their strong holds will you set on fire, and their young men will you slay with the sword, and will dash their children, and rip up their women with child.
\[13]And Hazael said, But what, is your servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD has showed me that you shall be king over Syria.
\[14]So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to you? And he answered, He told me that you should surely recover.
\[15]And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.
\[16]And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.
\[17]Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
\[18]And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.
\[19]Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him always a light, and to his children.
\[20]In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
\[21]So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.
\[22]Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
\[23]And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[24]And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
\[25]In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.
\[26]Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
\[27]And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab.
\[28]And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
\[29]And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.

nd Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up your loins, and take this box of oil in your hand, and go to Ramothgilead:
\[2]And when you come thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brothers, and carry him to an inner chamber;
\[3]Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus said the LORD, I have anointed you king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.
\[4]So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.
\[5]And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to you, O captain. And Jehu said, To which of all us? And he said, To you, O captain.
\[6]And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.
\[7]And you shall smite the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.
\[8]For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that urinates against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:
\[9]And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:
\[10]And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.
\[11]Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said to him, Is all well? why came this mad fellow to you? And he said to them, You know the man, and his communication.
\[12]And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spoke he to me, saying, Thus said the LORD, I have anointed you king over Israel.
\[13]Then they hurried, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.
\[14]So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.
\[15]But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.)  And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.
\[16]So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there.  And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.
\[17]And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?
\[18]So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus said the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What have you to do with peace? turn you behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he comes not again.
\[19]Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus said the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What have you to do with peace? turn you behind me.
\[20]And the watchman told, saying, He came even to them, and comes not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously.
\[21]And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
\[22]And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the prostitutions of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?
\[23]And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.
\[24]And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.
\[25]Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;
\[26]Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, said the LORD; and I will requite you in this plat, said the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.
\[27]But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam.  And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.
\[28]And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulcher with his fathers in the city of David.
\[29]And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.
\[30]And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.
\[31]And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?
\[32]And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side?  who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.
\[33]And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he stepped her under foot.
\[34]And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.
\[35]And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.
\[36]Why they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:
\[37]And the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.

nd Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,
\[2]Now as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armor;
\[3]Look even out the best and meet of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.
\[4]But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?
\[5]And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are your servants, and will do all that you shall bid us; we will not make any king: do you that which is good in your eyes.
\[6]Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If you be mine, and if you will listen to my voice, take you the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up.
\[7]And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.
\[8]And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay you them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.
\[9]And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, You be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?
\[10]Know now that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah.
\[11]So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.
\[12]And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house in the way,
\[13]Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are you? And they answered, We are the brothers of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.
\[14]And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.
\[15]And when he was departed there, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me your hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.
\[16]And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot.
\[17]And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke to Elijah.
\[18]And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.
\[19]Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
\[20]And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.
\[21]And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.
\[22]And he said to him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.
\[23]And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said to the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.
\[24]And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him.
\[25]And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.
\[26]And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.
\[27]And they broke down the image of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house to this day.
\[28]Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
\[29]However, from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.
\[30]And the LORD said to Jehu, Because you have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.
\[31]But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.
\[32]In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;
\[33]From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
\[34]Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[35]And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.

\[10]And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.
\[11]And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple.
\[12]And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.
\[13]And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.
\[14]And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.
\[15]But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said to them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that follows her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.
\[16]And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.
\[17]And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD's people; between the king also and the people.
\[18]And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and broke it down; his altars and his images broke they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.
\[19]And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.
\[20]And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's house.

n the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zibiah of Beersheba.
\[2]And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
\[3]But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
\[4]And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of every one that passes the account, the money that every man is set at, and all the money that comes into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,
\[5]Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, wherever any breach shall be found.
\[6]But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
\[7]Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other priests, and said to them, Why repair you not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.
\[8]And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.
\[9]But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.
\[10]And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the LORD.
\[11]And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that worked on the house of the LORD,
\[12]And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.
\[13]However, there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD:
\[14]But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD.
\[15]Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.
\[16]The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests'.
\[17]Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.
\[18]And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.
\[19]And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[20]And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goes down to Silla.
\[21]For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

\[2]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
\[3]And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days.
\[4]And Jehoahaz sought the LORD, and the LORD listened to him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.
\[5](And the LORD gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelled in their tents, as beforetime.
\[6]Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.)
\[7]Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.
\[8]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[9]And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.
\[10]In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years.
\[11]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin: but he walked therein.
\[12]And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[13]And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat on his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
\[14]Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.
\[15]And Elisha said to him, Take bow and arrows. And he took to him bow and arrows.
\[16]And he said to the king of Israel, Put your hand on the bow. And he put his hand on it: and Elisha put his hands on the king's hands.
\[17]And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for you shall smite the Syrians in Aphek, till you have consumed them.
\[18]And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Smite on the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed.
\[19]And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, You should have smitten five or six times; then had you smitten Syria till you had consumed it: whereas now you shall smite Syria but thrice.
\[20]And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
\[21]And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulcher of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.
\[22]But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
\[23]And the LORD was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.
\[24]So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.
\[25]And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.

\[2]He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
\[3]And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father did.
\[4]However, the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.
\[5]And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.
\[6]But the children of the murderers he slew not: according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
\[7]He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day.
\[8]Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
\[9]And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and stepped down the thistle.
\[10]You have indeed smitten Edom, and your heart has lifted you up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why should you meddle to your hurt, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?
\[11]But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Bethshemesh, which belongs to Judah.
\[12]And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents.
\[13]And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
\[14]And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.
\[15]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

\[18]And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[19]Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
\[20]And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
\[21]And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.
\[22]He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
\[23]In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.
\[24]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
\[25]He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher.
\[26]For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel.
\[27]And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
\[28]Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

\[20]And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.

\[3]But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.
\[4]And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
\[5]Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.
\[6]At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelled there to this day.
\[7]So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I am your servant and your son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.
\[8]And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.
\[9]And the king of Assyria listened to him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.

\[11]And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus.
\[12]And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.
\[13]And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, on the altar.
\[14]And he brought also the brazen altar, which was before the LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.
\[15]And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire by.
\[16]Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.
\[17]And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it on the pavement of stones.

n the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.
\[2]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.
\[3]Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.
\[4]And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
\[5]Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.
\[6]In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
\[7]For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
\[8]And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.
\[9]And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
\[10]And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:
\[11]And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and worked wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:
\[12]For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said to them, You shall not do this thing.
\[13]Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn you from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.
\[14]Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.
\[15]And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them.
\[16]And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
\[17]And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
\[18]Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
\[19]Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.
\[20]And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.
\[21]For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.
\[22]For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;
\[23]Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.
\[24]And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelled in the cities thereof.
\[25]And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them.
\[26]Why they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which you have removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he has sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.
\[27]Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom you brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.
\[28]Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelled in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.
\[29]However, every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelled.
\[30]And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
\[31]And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
\[32]So they feared the LORD, and made to themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.
\[33]They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from there.
\[34]To this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;
\[35]With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, You shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:
\[36]But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall you fear, and him shall you worship, and to him shall you do sacrifice.
\[37]And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do for ever more; and you shall not fear other gods.
\[38]And the covenant that I have made with you you shall not forget; neither shall you fear other gods.
\[39]But the LORD your God you shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
\[40]However, they did not listen, but they did after their former manner.
\[41]So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they to this day.

ow it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
\[2]Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
\[3]And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.
\[4]He removed the high places, and broke the images, and cut down the groves, and broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made: for to those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.
\[5]He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.
\[6]For he held to the LORD, and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.
\[7]And the LORD was with him; and he prospered wherever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.
\[8]He smote the Philistines, even to Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
\[9]And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
\[10]And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is in the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
\[11]And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel to Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:
\[12]Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.
\[13]Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.
\[14]And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
\[15]And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.
\[16]At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
\[17]And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.
\[18]And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
\[19]And Rabshakeh said to them, Speak you now to Hezekiah, Thus said the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein you trust?
\[20]You say, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?
\[21]Now, behold, you trust on the staff of this bruised reed, even on Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him.
\[22]But if you say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
\[23]Now therefore, I pray you, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver you two thousand horses, if you be able on your part to set riders on them.
\[24]How then will you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
\[25]Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it?  The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
\[26]Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray you, to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
\[27]But Rabshakeh said to them, Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? has he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own urine with you?
\[28]Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spoke, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:
\[29]Thus said the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:
\[30]Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[31]Listen not to Hezekiah: for thus said the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat you every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink you every one the waters of his cistern:
\[32]Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that you may live, and not die: and listen not to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.
\[33]Has any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\[34]Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
\[35]Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
\[36]But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
\[37]Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

nd it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
\[2]And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
\[3]And they said to him, Thus said Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
\[4]It may be the LORD your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD your God has heard: why lift up your prayer for the remnant that are left.
\[5]So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
\[6]And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall you say to your master, Thus said the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
\[7]Behold, I will send a blast on him, and he shall hear a rumor, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
\[8]So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
\[9]And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against you: he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,
\[10]Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[11]Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shall you be delivered?
\[12]Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?
\[13]Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?
\[14]And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
\[15]And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwell between the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.
\[16]LORD, bow down your ear, and hear: open, LORD, your eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which has sent him to reproach the living God.
\[17]Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,
\[18]And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
\[19]Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech you, save you us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are the LORD God, even you only.
\[20]Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, That which you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.
\[21]This is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion has despised you, and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.
\[22]Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? and against whom have you exalted your voice, and lifted up your eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.
\[23]By your messengers you have reproached the LORD, and have said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.
\[24]I have dig and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.
\[25]Have you not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that you should be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.
\[26]Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.
\[27]But I know your stayed, and your going out, and your coming in, and your rage against me.
\[28]Because your rage against me and your tumult is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.
\[29]And this shall be a sign to you, You shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.
\[30]And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
\[31]For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.
\[32]Therefore thus said the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.
\[33]By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, said the LORD.
\[34]For I will defend this city, to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\[35]And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.
\[36]So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelled at Nineveh.
\[37]And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

n those days was Hezekiah sick to death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus said the LORD, Set your house in order; for you shall die, and not live.
\[2]Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the LORD, saying,
\[3]I beseech you, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
\[4]And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
\[5]Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus said the LORD, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: behold, I will heal you: on the third day you shall go up to the house of the LORD.
\[6]And I will add to your days fifteen years; and I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\[7]And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.
\[8]And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?
\[9]And Isaiah said, This sign shall you have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?
\[10]And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: no, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.
\[11]And Isaiah the prophet cried to the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.
\[12]At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
\[13]And Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.
\[14]Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from from where came they to you? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.
\[15]And he said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.
\[16]And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.
\[17]Behold, the days come, that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, said the LORD.
\[18]And of your sons that shall issue from you, which you shall beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
\[19]Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which you have spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?
\[20]And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[21]And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

anasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hephzibah.
\[2]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
\[3]For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
\[4]And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.
\[5]And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
\[6]And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he worked much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
\[7]And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
\[8]Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.
\[9]But they listened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.
\[10]And the LORD spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,
\[11]Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols:
\[12]Therefore thus said the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.
\[13]And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.
\[14]And I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;
\[15]Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even to this day.
\[16]Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.
\[17]Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[18]And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
\[19]Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
\[20]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did.
\[21]And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:
\[22]And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.
\[23]And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.
\[24]And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
\[25]Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

\[2]And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.
\[3]And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,
\[4]Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people:
\[5]And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,
\[6]To carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.
\[7]However, there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.
\[8]And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
\[9]And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Your servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.
\[10]And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
\[11]And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.
\[12]And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,
\[13]Go you, inquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.
\[14]So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.
\[15]And she said to them, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,
\[16]Thus said the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read:
\[17]Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.
\[18]But to the king of Judah which sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, As touching the words which you have heard;
\[19]Because your heart was tender, and you have humbled yourself before the LORD, when you heard what I spoke against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have rent your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, said the LORD.
\[20]Behold therefore, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered into your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring on this place. And they brought the king word again.

nd the king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.
\[2]And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD.
\[3]And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.
\[4]And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Bethel.
\[5]And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
\[6]And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof on the graves of the children of the people.
\[7]And he broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.
\[8]And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and broke down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.
\[9]Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brothers.
\[10]And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.
\[11]And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
\[12]And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.
\[13]And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.
\[14]And he broke in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.
\[15]Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.
\[16]And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchers that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchers, and burned them on the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.
\[17]Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulcher of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.
\[18]And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.
\[19]And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.
\[20]And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there on the altars, and burned men's bones on them, and returned to Jerusalem.
\[21]And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.
\[22]Surely there was not held such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;
\[23]But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was held to the LORD in Jerusalem.
\[24]Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.
\[25]And like to him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.
\[26]Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him with.
\[27]And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.
\[28]Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[29]In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.
\[30]And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulcher. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.
\[31]Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\[32]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.
\[33]And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
\[34]And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.
\[35]And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it to Pharaohnechoh.
\[36]Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
\[37]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.

n his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.
\[2]And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servants the prophets.
\[3]Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this on Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;
\[4]And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon.
\[5]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[6]So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
\[7]And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.
\[8]Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
\[9]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done.
\[10]At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
\[11]And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants did besiege it.
\[12]And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
\[13]And he carried out there all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.
\[14]And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.
\[15]And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
\[16]And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
\[17]And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
\[18]Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\[19]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
\[20]For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

nd it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.
\[2]And the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
\[3]And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
\[4]And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.
\[5]And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.
\[6]So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment on him.
\[7]And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.
\[8]And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem:
\[9]And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's house burnt he with fire.
\[10]And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.
\[11]Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away.
\[12]But the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and farmers.
\[13]And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.
\[14]And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, took they away.
\[15]And the fire pans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.
\[16]The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
\[17]The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the capital on it was brass: and the height of the capital three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates on the capital round about, all of brass: and like to these had the second pillar with wreathen work.
\[18]And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:
\[19]And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and three score men of the people of the land that were found in the city:
\[20]And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:
\[21]And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.
\[22]And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.
\[23]And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
\[24]And Gedaliah swore to them, and to their men, and said to them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.
\[25]But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.
\[26]And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees.
\[27]And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;
\[28]And he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;
\[29]And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life.
\[30]And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.

\[26]And the sons of Mishma; Hamuel his son, Zacchur his son, Shimei his son.
\[27]And Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters: but his brothers had not many children, neither did all their family multiply, like to the children of Judah.
\[28]And they dwelled at Beersheba, and Moladah, and Hazarshual,
\[29]And at Bilhah, and at Ezem, and at Tolad,
\[30]And at Bethuel, and at Hormah, and at Ziklag,
\[31]And at Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusim, and at Bethbirei, and at Shaaraim. These were their cities to the reign of David.

\[39]And they went to the entrance of Gedor, even to the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.
\[40]And they found fat pasture and good, and the land was wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for they of Ham had dwelled there of old.
\[41]And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were found there, and destroyed them utterly to this day, and dwelled in their rooms: because there was pasture there for their flocks.
\[42]And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.
\[43]And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped, and dwelled there to this day.

ow the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was the firstborn; but for as much as he defiled his father's bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.
\[2]For Judah prevailed above his brothers, and of him came the chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph's:)
\[3]The sons, I say, of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were, Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
\[4]The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,
\[5]Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son,
\[6]Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.
\[7]And his brothers by their families, when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned, were the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah,
\[8]And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelled in Aroer, even to Nebo and Baalmeon:
\[9]And eastward he inhabited to the entering in of the wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead.
\[10]And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand: and they dwelled in their tents throughout all the east land of Gilead.
\[11]And the children of Gad dwelled over against them, in the land of Bashan to Salcah:
\[12]Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat in Bashan.
\[13]And their brothers of the house of their fathers were, Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and Zia, and Heber, seven.
\[14]These are the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;
\[15]Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of their fathers.
\[16]And they dwelled in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, on their borders.
\[17]All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.
\[18]The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and skillful in war, were four and forty thousand seven hundred and three score, that went out to the war.
\[19]And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab.
\[20]And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them: for they cried to God in the battle, and he was entreated of them; because they put their trust in him.
\[21]And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand.
\[22]For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God. And they dwelled in their steads until the captivity.
\[23]And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelled in the land: they increased from Bashan to Baalhermon and Senir, and to mount Hermon.
\[24]And these were the heads of the house of their fathers, even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valor, famous men, and heads of the house of their fathers.
\[25]And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them.
\[26]And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, to this day.

ow the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
\[2]And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.
\[3]And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.
\[4]Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armor bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell on it.
\[5]And when his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.
\[6]So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.
\[7]And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelled in them.
\[8]And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
\[9]And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings to their idols, and to the people.
\[10]And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
\[11]And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
\[12]They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
\[13]So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to inquire of it;
\[14]And inquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.

hen all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
\[2]And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, you were he that led out and brought in Israel: and the LORD your God said to you, You shall feed my people Israel, and you shall be ruler over my people Israel.
\[3]Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.
\[4]And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.
\[5]And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, You shall not come here. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David.
\[6]And David said, Whoever smites the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.
\[7]And David dwelled in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.
\[8]And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
\[9]So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with him.
\[10]These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
\[11]And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.
\[12]And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.
\[13]He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.
\[14]And they set themselves in the middle of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance.
\[15]Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
\[16]And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at Bethlehem.
\[17]And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!
\[18]And the three broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.
\[19]And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it.  These things did these three mightiest.
\[20]And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three.
\[21]Of the three, he was more honorable than the two; for he was their captain: however, he attained not to the first three.
\[22]Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lion like men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.
\[23]And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
\[24]These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighty men.
\[25]Behold, he was honorable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard.
\[26]Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
\[27]Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
\[28]Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite,

\[2]They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul's brothers of Benjamin.
\[3]The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite.

\[8]And of the Gadites there separated themselves to David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes on the mountains;
\[9]Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
\[10]Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
\[11]Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
\[12]Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,

\[14]These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.
\[15]These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.
\[16]And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold to David.
\[17]And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If you be come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you: but if you be come to betray me to my enemies, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.
\[18]Then the spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Your are we, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you.  Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.
\[19]And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines on advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.
\[20]As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.
\[21]And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the host.
\[22]For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God.
\[23]And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.
\[24]The children of Judah that bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.
\[25]Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valor for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.
\[26]Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.
\[27]And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred;
\[28]And Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his father's house twenty and two captains.
\[29]And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for till now the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.
\[30]And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous throughout the house of their fathers.
\[31]And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king.
\[32]And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brothers were at their commandment.
\[33]Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they were not of double heart.
\[34]And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.
\[35]And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.
\[36]And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand.
\[37]And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.
\[38]All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.
\[39]And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brothers had prepared for them.
\[40]Moreover they that were near them, even to Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.

\[2]And David said to all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good to you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad to our brothers every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves to us:
\[3]And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul.
\[4]And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
\[5]So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even to the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.
\[6]And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up there the ark of God the LORD, that dwells between the cherubim, whose name is called on it.
\[7]And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.
\[8]And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
\[9]And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.
\[10]And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.
\[11]And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach on Uzza: why that place is called Perezuzza to this day.
\[12]And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?
\[13]So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.
\[14]And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.

\[9]And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\[10]And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? And will you deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said to him, Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.
\[11]So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God has broken in on my enemies by my hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.
\[12]And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.
\[13]And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.

\[15]And it shall be, when you shall hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall go out to battle: for God is gone forth before you to smite the host of the Philistines.

\[3]And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD to his place, which he had prepared for it.
\[4]And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:
\[5]Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brothers an hundred and twenty:
\[6]Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred and twenty:
\[7]Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief and his brothers an hundred and thirty:

\[9]Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brothers fourscore:
\[10]Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brothers an hundred and twelve.
\[11]And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,
\[12]And said to them, You are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers, that you may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel to the place that I have prepared for it.
\[13]For because you did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach on us, for that we sought him not after the due order.
\[14]So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.
\[15]And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.
\[16]And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers to be the singers with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.
\[17]So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
\[18]And with them their brothers of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.

\[20]And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;
\[21]And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.
\[22]And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skillful.

\[26]And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.
\[27]And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had on him an ephod of linen.
\[28]Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.

\[16]Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath to Isaac;
\[17]And has confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,
\[18]Saying, To you will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;
\[19]When you were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.
\[20]And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people;
\[21]He suffered no man to do them wrong: yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,
\[22]Saying, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
\[23]Sing to the LORD, all the earth; show forth from day to day his salvation.
\[24]Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvelous works among all nations.
\[25]For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods.
\[26]For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.
\[27]Glory and honor are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place.
\[28]Give to the LORD, you kindreds of the people, give to the LORD glory and strength.
\[29]Give to the LORD the glory due to his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
\[30]Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.
\[31]Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigns.
\[32]Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.
\[33]Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he comes to judge the earth.
\[34]O give thanks to the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endures for ever.
\[35]And say you, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to your holy name, and glory in your praise.
\[36]Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.

\[39]And Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,
\[40]To offer burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;

\[7]Now therefore thus shall you say to my servant David, Thus said the LORD of hosts, I took you from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that you should be ruler over my people Israel:
\[8]And I have been with you wherever you have walked, and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and have made you a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.
\[9]Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,
\[10]And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all your enemies. Furthermore I tell you that the LORD will build you an house.
\[11]And it shall come to pass, when your days be expired that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will raise up your seed after you, which shall be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
\[12]He shall build me an house, and I will establish his throne for ever.
\[13]I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before you:
\[14]But I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for ever more.
\[15]According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.
\[16]And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that you have brought me till now?
\[17]And yet this was a small thing in your eyes, O God; for you have also spoken of your servant's house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.
\[18]What can David speak more to you for the honor of your servant? for you know your servant.
\[19]O LORD, for your servant's sake, and according to your own heart, have you done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.
\[20]O LORD, there is none like you, neither is there any God beside you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
\[21]And what one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make you a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before your people whom you have redeemed out of Egypt?
\[22]For your people Israel did you make your own people for ever; and you, LORD, became their God.
\[23]Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as you have said.
\[24]Let it even be established, that your name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David your servant be established before you.
\[25]For you, O my God, have told your servant that you will build him an house: therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray before you.
\[26]And now, LORD, you are God, and have promised this goodness to your servant:
\[27]Now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may be before you for ever: for you bless, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.

\[2]And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.
\[3]And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.
\[4]And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.
\[5]And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
\[6]Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David wherever he went.
\[7]And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
\[8]Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, with which Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
\[9]Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;
\[10]He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.
\[11]Them also king David dedicated to the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.
\[12]Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.
\[13]And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David wherever he went.
\[14]So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.
\[15]And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.
\[16]And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;
\[17]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.

ow it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.
\[2]And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
\[3]But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Think you that David does honor your father, that he has sent comforters to you?  are not his servants come to you for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?
\[4]Why Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.
\[5]Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
\[6]And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.
\[7]So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.
\[8]And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
\[9]And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.
\[10]Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.
\[11]And the rest of the people he delivered to the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.
\[12]And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then you shall help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for you, then I will help you.
\[13]Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight.
\[14]So Joab and the people that were with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.
\[15]And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
\[16]And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.
\[17]And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came on them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
\[18]But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.
\[19]And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.

nd it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.
\[2]And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set on David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.
\[3]And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
\[4]And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.
\[5]And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.
\[6]And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant.
\[7]But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him.

nd Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.
\[2]And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.
\[3]And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants?  why then does my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?
\[4]Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Why Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
\[5]And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred three score and ten thousand men that drew sword.
\[6]But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.
\[7]And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.
\[8]And David said to God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech you, do away the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.
\[9]And the LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,
\[10]Go and tell David, saying, Thus said the LORD, I offer you three things: choose you one of them, that I may do it to you.
\[11]So Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus said the LORD, Choose you
\[12]Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before your foes, while that the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise yourself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.
\[13]And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.
\[14]So the LORD sent pestilence on Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
\[15]And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now your hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\[16]And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.
\[17]And David said to God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let your hand, I pray you, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on your people, that they should be plagued.
\[18]Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar to the LORD in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\[19]And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the LORD.
\[20]And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
\[21]And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.
\[22]Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar therein to the LORD: you shall grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.
\[23]And Ornan said to David, Take it to you, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: see, I give you the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.
\[24]And king David said to Ornan, No; but I will truly buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is your for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.
\[25]So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
\[26]And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire on the altar of burnt offering.
\[27]And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.
\[28]At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
\[29]For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon.
\[30]But David could not go before it to inquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.

\[2]And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew worked stones to build the house of God.
\[3]And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;
\[4]Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.
\[5]And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceeding magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.
\[6]Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel.
\[7]And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house to the name of the LORD my God:
\[8]But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars: you shall not build an house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.
\[9]Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.
\[10]He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.
\[11]Now, my son, the LORD be with you; and prosper you, and build the house of the LORD your God, as he has said of you.
\[12]Only the LORD give you wisdom and understanding, and give you charge concerning Israel, that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.
\[13]Then shall you prosper, if you take heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.
\[14]Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and you may add thereto.
\[15]Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.
\[16]Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with you.
\[17]David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
\[18]Is not the LORD your God with you? and has he not given you rest on every side? for he has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.
\[19]Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build you the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.

o when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
\[2]And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
\[3]Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.
\[4]Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:
\[5]Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.
\[6]And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
\[7]Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.
\[8]The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
\[9]The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.
\[10]And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
\[11]And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house.
\[12]The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
\[13]The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister to him, and to bless in his name for ever.
\[14]Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.
\[15]The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.
\[16]Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.
\[17]And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
\[18]Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.
\[19]Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
\[20]Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second.
\[21]The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.
\[22]And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brothers the sons of Kish took them.
\[23]The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
\[24]These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.
\[25]For David said, The LORD God of Israel has given rest to his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:
\[26]And also to the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.
\[27]For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:
\[28]Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;
\[29]Both for the show bread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;
\[30]And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even:
\[31]And to offer all burnt sacrifices to the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded to them, continually before the LORD:
\[32]And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brothers, in the service of the house of the LORD.

\[3]Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Elioenai the seventh.
\[4]Moreover the sons of Obededom were, Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethaneel the fifth.
\[5]Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth: for God blessed him.
\[6]Also to Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled throughout the house of their father: for they were mighty men of valor.
\[7]The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brothers were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.
\[8]All these of the sons of Obededom: they and their sons and their brothers, able men for strength for the service, were three score and two of Obededom.
\[9]And Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, strong men, eighteen.
\[10]Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him the chief;)
\[11]Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen.
\[12]Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the LORD.
\[13]And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate.

\[15]To Obededom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim.
\[16]To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward against ward.
\[17]Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and toward Asuppim two and two.
\[18]At Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.
\[19]These are the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore, and among the sons of Merari.
\[20]And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things.
\[21]As concerning the sons of Laadan; the sons of the Gershonite Laadan, chief fathers, even of Laadan the Gershonite, were Jehieli.
\[22]The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel his brother, which were over the treasures of the house of the LORD.
\[23]Of the Amramites, and the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites:
\[24]And Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of the treasures.
\[25]And his brothers by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son.
\[26]Which Shelomith and his brothers were over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host, had dedicated.
\[27]Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the house of the LORD.
\[28]And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; and whoever had dedicated any thing, it was under the hand of Shelomith, and of his brothers.
\[29]Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges.
\[30]And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, men of valor, a thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of the LORD, and in the service of the king.
\[31]Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valor at Jazer of Gilead.
\[32]And his brothers, men of valor, were two thousand and seven hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.

\[2]Then David the king stood up on his feet, and said, Hear me, my brothers, and my people: As for me, I had in my heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building:
\[3]But God said to me, You shall not build an house for my name, because you have been a man of war, and have shed blood.
\[4]However, the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he has chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel:
\[5]And of all my sons, (for the LORD has given me many sons,) he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.
\[6]And he said to me, Solomon your son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.
\[7]Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.
\[8]Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.
\[9]And you, Solomon my son, know you the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts: if you seek him, he will be found of you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off for ever.
\[10]Take heed now; for the LORD has chosen you to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.
\[11]Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlors thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,
\[12]And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:
\[13]Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.
\[14]He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:
\[15]Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.
\[16]And by weight he gave gold for the tables of show bread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:
\[17]Also pure gold for the meat hooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basins he gave gold by weight for every basin; and likewise silver by weight for every basin of silver:
\[18]And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
\[19]All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand on me, even all the works of this pattern.
\[20]And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you, until you have finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.
\[21]And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with you for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with you for all manner of workmanship every willing skillful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at your commandment.

urthermore David the king said to all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.
\[2]Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
\[3]Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of my own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house.
\[4]Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses with:
\[5]The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day to the LORD?
\[6]Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,
\[7]And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.
\[8]And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
\[9]Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
\[10]Why David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be you, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.
\[11]Yours, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is yours; your is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all.
\[12]Both riches and honor come of you, and you reign over all; and in your hand is power and might; and in your hand it is to make great, and to give strength to all.
\[13]Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name.
\[14]But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of you, and of your own have we given you.
\[15]For we are strangers before you, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.
\[16]O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you an house for your holy name comes of your hand, and is all your own.
\[17]I know also, my God, that you try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy your people, which are present here, to offer willingly to you.
\[18]O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart to you:
\[19]And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.
\[20]And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.
\[21]And they sacrificed sacrifices to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings to the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:
\[22]And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him to the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.
\[23]Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.
\[24]And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king.
\[25]And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
\[26]Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
\[27]And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
\[28]And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
\[29]Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,
\[30]With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.

nd Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.
\[2]Then Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.
\[3]So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.
\[4]But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
\[5]Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought to it.
\[6]And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.
\[7]In that night did God appear to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give you.
\[8]And Solomon said to God, You have showed great mercy to David my father, and have made me to reign in his stead.
\[9]Now, O LORD God, let your promise to David my father be established: for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.
\[10]Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this your people, that is so great?
\[11]And God said to Solomon, Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of your enemies, neither yet have asked long life; but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king:
\[12]Wisdom and knowledge is granted to you; and I will give you riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that have been before you, neither shall there any after you have the like.
\[13]Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.
\[14]And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\[15]And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance.
\[16]And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
\[17]And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.

\[2]And Solomon told out three score and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
\[3]And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As you did deal with David my father, and did send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.
\[4]Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual show bread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.
\[5]And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods.
\[6]But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?
\[7]Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.
\[8]Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that your servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with your servants,
\[9]Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great.
\[10]And, behold, I will give to your servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
\[11]Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD has loved his people, he has made you king over them.
\[12]Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.
\[13]And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,
\[14]The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of engraving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with your cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David your father.
\[15]Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants:
\[16]And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need: and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.
\[17]And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.
\[18]And he set three score and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.

\[2]And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
\[3]Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was three score cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
\[4]And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
\[5]And the greater house he paneled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.
\[6]And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.
\[7]He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the walls.
\[8]And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.
\[9]And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
\[10]And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work, and overlaid them with gold.
\[11]And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
\[12]And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.
\[13]The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.
\[14]And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and worked cherubim thereon.
\[15]Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.
\[16]And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.
\[17]And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.

\[3]And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.
\[4]It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above on them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
\[5]And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held three thousand baths.
\[6]He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.
\[7]And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
\[8]He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basins of gold.

\[12]To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;
\[13]And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the capitals which were on the pillars.
\[14]He made also bases, and lavers made he on the bases;
\[15]One sea, and twelve oxen under it.
\[16]The pots also, and the shovels, and the meat hooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass.
\[17]In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.
\[18]Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.
\[19]And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables where on the show bread was set;
\[20]Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;
\[21]And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that perfect gold;
\[22]And the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.

hus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.
\[2]Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
\[3]Why all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king in the feast which was in the seventh month.
\[4]And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.
\[5]And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.
\[6]Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled to him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
\[7]And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim:
\[8]For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
\[9]And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is to this day.
\[10]There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
\[11]And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:
\[12]Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brothers, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)
\[13]It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endures for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;
\[14]So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.

hen said Solomon, The LORD has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
\[2]But I have built an house of habitation for you, and a place for your dwelling for ever.
\[3]And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.
\[4]And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who has with his hands fulfilled that which he spoke with his mouth to my father David, saying,
\[5]Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:
\[6]But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
\[7]Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
\[8]But the LORD said to David my father, For as much as it was in your heart to build an house for my name, you did well in that it was in your heart:
\[9]Notwithstanding you shall not build the house; but your son which shall come forth out of your loins, he shall build the house for my name.
\[10]The LORD therefore has performed his word that he has spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
\[11]And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.
\[12]And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:
\[13]For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the middle of the court: and on it he stood, and kneeled down on his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven.
\[14]And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like you in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keep covenant, and show mercy to your servants, that walk before you with all their hearts:
\[15]You which have kept with your servant David my father that which you have promised him; and spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.
\[16]Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; yet so that your children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as you have walked before me.
\[17]Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let your word be verified, which you have spoken to your servant David.
\[18]But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house which I have built!
\[19]Have respect therefore to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to listen to the cry and the prayer which your servant prays before you:
\[20]That your eyes may be open on this house day and night, on the place whereof you have said that you would put your name there; to listen to the prayer which your servant prays toward this place.
\[21]Listen therefore to the supplications of your servant, and of your people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear you from your dwelling place, even from heaven; and when you hear, forgive.
\[22]If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid on him to make him swear, and the oath come before your altar in this house;
\[23]Then hear you from heaven, and do, and judge your servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way on his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.
\[24]And if your people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against you; and shall return and confess your name, and pray and make supplication before you in this house;
\[25]Then hear you from the heavens, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers.
\[26]When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you do afflict them;
\[27]Then hear you from heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you have taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance.
\[28]If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillars; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatever sore or whatever sickness there be:
\[29]Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all your people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:
\[30]Then hear you from heaven your dwelling place, and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know; (for you only know the hearts of the children of men:)
\[31]That they may fear you, to walk in your ways, so long as they live in the land which you gave to our fathers.
\[32]Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of your people Israel, but is come from a far country for your great name's sake, and your mighty hand, and your stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house;
\[33]Then hear you from the heavens, even from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calls to you for; that all people of the earth may know your name, and fear you, as does your people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by your name.
\[34]If your people go out to war against their enemies by the way that you shall send them, and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name;
\[35]Then hear you from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
\[36]If they sin against you, (for there is no man which sins not,) and you be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives to a land far off or near;
\[37]Yet if they bethink themselves in the land where they are carried captive, and turn and pray to you in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;
\[38]If they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, and toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name:
\[39]Then hear you from the heavens, even from your dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive your people which have sinned against you.
\[40]Now, my God, let, I beseech you, your eyes be open, and let your ears be attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.
\[41]Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into your resting place, you, and the ark of your strength: let your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let your saints rejoice in goodness.
\[42]O LORD God, turn not away the face of your anointed: remember the mercies of David your servant.

ow when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.
\[2]And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's house.
\[3]And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD on the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endures for ever.
\[4]Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.
\[5]And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
\[6]And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endures for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.
\[7]Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.
\[8]Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt.
\[9]And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.
\[10]And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had showed to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.
\[11]Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.
\[12]And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice.
\[13]If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;
\[14]If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
\[15]Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.
\[16]For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
\[17]And as for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and shall observe my statutes and my judgments;
\[18]Then will I establish the throne of your kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David your father, saying, There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.
\[19]But if you turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;
\[20]Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations.
\[21]And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passes by it; so that he shall say, Why has the LORD done thus to this land, and to this house?
\[22]And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore has he brought all this evil on them.

nd it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,
\[2]That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
\[3]And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.
\[4]And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.
\[5]Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;
\[6]And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.
\[7]As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel,
\[8]But of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.
\[9]But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen.
\[10]And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two hundred and fifty, that bore rule over the people.
\[11]And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David to the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD has come.
\[12]Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,
\[13]Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.
\[14]And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.
\[15]And they departed not from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
\[16]Now all the work of Solomon was prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected.
\[17]Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom.
\[18]And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took there four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.

nd when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bore spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
\[2]And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.
\[3]And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
\[4]And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
\[5]And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in my own land of your acts, and of your wisdom:
\[6]However, I believed not their words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me: for you exceed the fame that I heard.
\[7]Happy are your men, and happy are these your servants, which stand continually before you, and hear your wisdom.
\[8]Blessed be the LORD your God, which delighted in you to set you on his throne, to be king for the LORD your God: because your God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he you king over them, to do judgment and justice.
\[9]And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.
\[10]And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.
\[11]And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.
\[12]And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, beside that which she had brought to the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.
\[13]Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and three score and six talents of gold;
\[14]Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
\[15]And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.
\[16]And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
\[17]Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
\[18]And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays:
\[19]And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.
\[20]And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
\[21]For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
\[22]And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
\[23]And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.
\[24]And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
\[25]And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\[26]And he reigned over all the kings from the river even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
\[27]And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance.
\[28]And they brought to Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
\[29]Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
\[30]And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.

nd Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king.
\[2]And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in Egypt, where he fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.
\[3]And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
\[4]Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease you somewhat the grievous servitude of your father, and his heavy yoke that he put on us, and we will serve you.
\[5]And he said to them, Come again to me after three days. And the people departed.
\[6]And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give you me to return answer to this people?
\[7]And they spoke to him, saying, If you be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be your servants for ever.
\[8]But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.
\[9]And he said to them, What advice give you that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that your father did put on us?
\[10]And the young men that were brought up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall you answer the people that spoke to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it somewhat lighter for us; thus shall you say to them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
\[11]For whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\[12]So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.
\[13]And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
\[14]And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\[15]So the king listened not to the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\[16]And when all Israel saw that the king would not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David?  and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to your own house. So all Israel went to their tents.
\[17]But as for the children of Israel that dwelled in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
\[18]Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.

\[2]But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
\[3]Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
\[4]Thus said the LORD, You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.
\[5]And Rehoboam dwelled in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.
\[6]He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
\[7]And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,
\[8]And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
\[9]And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
\[10]And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities.
\[11]And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.
\[12]And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.
\[13]And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.
\[14]For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office to the LORD:
\[15]And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.
\[16]And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice to the LORD God of their fathers.
\[17]So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.
\[18]And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;
\[19]Which bore him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.
\[20]And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
\[21]And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and three score concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and three score daughters.)
\[22]And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brothers: for he thought to make him king.
\[23]And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, to every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.

\[2]And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,
\[3]With twelve hundred chariots, and three score thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.
\[4]And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.
\[5]Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus said the LORD, You have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
\[6]Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.
\[7]And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
\[8]Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
\[9]So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
\[10]Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.
\[11]And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.
\[12]And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.
\[13]So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
\[14]And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.
\[15]Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
\[16]And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.

ow in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.
\[2]He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
\[3]And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valor.
\[4]And Abijah stood up on mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, you Jeroboam, and all Israel;
\[5]Ought you not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
\[6]Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and has rebelled against his lord.
\[7]And there are gathered to him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.
\[8]And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and you be a great multitude, and there are with your golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.
\[9]Have you not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.
\[10]But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister to the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait on their business:
\[11]And they burn to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the show bread also set they in order on the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but you have forsaken him.
\[12]And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight you not against the LORD God of your fathers; for you shall not prosper.
\[13]But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them.
\[14]And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried to the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
\[15]Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
\[16]And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.
\[17]And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
\[18]Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the LORD God of their fathers.
\[19]And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.
\[20]Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.
\[21]But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.
\[22]And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.

o Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.
\[2]And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:
\[3]For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and broke down the images, and cut down the groves:
\[4]And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.
\[5]Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.
\[6]And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.
\[7]Therefore he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.
\[8]And Asa had an army of men that bore targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.
\[9]And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came to Mareshah.
\[10]Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
\[11]And Asa cried to the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with you to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on you, and in your name we go against this multitude. O LORD, you are our God; let no man prevail against you.
\[12]So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.
\[13]And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them to Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.
\[14]And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came on them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.
\[15]They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.

\[2]And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear you me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while you be with him; and if you seek him, he will be found of you; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.
\[3]Now for a long season Israel has been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.
\[4]But when they in their trouble did turn to the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.
\[5]And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were on all the inhabitants of the countries.
\[6]And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.
\[7]Be you strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.
\[8]And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.
\[9]And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.
\[10]So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
\[11]And they offered to the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
\[12]And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
\[13]That whoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
\[14]And they swore to the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
\[15]And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.
\[16]And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
\[17]But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
\[18]And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.

n the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
\[2]Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelled at Damascus, saying,
\[3]There is a league between me and you, as there was between my father and your father: behold, I have sent you silver and gold; go, break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
\[4]And Benhadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
\[5]And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.
\[6]Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, with which Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
\[7]And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD your God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand.
\[8]Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because you did rely on the LORD, he delivered them into your hand.
\[9]For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein you have done foolishly: therefore from now on you shall have wars.
\[10]Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.
\[11]And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, see, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\[12]And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.
\[13]And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.
\[14]And they buried him in his own sepulchers, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' are: and they made a very great burning for him.

\[2]And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.
\[3]And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not to Baalim;
\[4]But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.
\[5]Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honor in abundance.
\[6]And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.
\[7]Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.
\[8]And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests.

\[10]And the fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.
\[11]Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.
\[12]And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store.
\[13]And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valor, were in Jerusalem.
\[14]And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand.
\[15]And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand.
\[16]And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.

ow Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.
\[2]And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.
\[3]And Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Will you go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as you are, and my people as your people; and we will be with you in the war.
\[4]And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray you, at the word of the LORD to day.
\[5]Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.
\[6]But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might inquire of him?
\[7]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good to me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
\[8]And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
\[9]And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
\[10]And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus said the LORD, With these you shall push Syria until they be consumed.
\[11]And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
\[12]And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let your word therefore, I pray you, be like one of their's, and speak you good.
\[13]And Micaiah said, As the LORD lives, even what my God said, that will I speak.
\[14]And when he was come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go you up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.
\[15]And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?
\[16]Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.
\[17]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good to me, but evil?
\[18]Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.
\[19]And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
\[20]Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said to him, With which?
\[21]And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, You shall entice him, and you shall also prevail: go out, and do even so.
\[22]Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets, and the LORD has spoken evil against you.
\[23]Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak to you?
\[24]And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.
\[25]Then the king of Israel said, Take you Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
\[26]And say, Thus said the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.
\[27]And Micaiah said, If you certainly return in peace, then has not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Listen, all you people.
\[28]So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.
\[29]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and I will go to the battle; but put you on your robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.
\[30]Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight you not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.
\[31]And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.
\[32]For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.
\[33]And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn your hand, that you may carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
\[34]And the battle increased that day: however, the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.

\[2]Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There comes a great multitude against you from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which is Engedi.
\[3]And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
\[4]And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD.
\[5]And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,
\[6]And said, O LORD God of our fathers, are not you God in heaven? and rule not you over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in your hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand you?
\[7]Are not you our God, who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and gave it to the seed of Abraham your friend for ever?
\[8]And they dwelled therein, and have built you a sanctuary therein for your name, saying,
\[9]If, when evil comes on us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in your presence, (for your name is in this house,) and cry to you in our affliction, then you will hear and help.
\[10]And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;
\[11]Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit.
\[12]O our God, will you not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that comes against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are on you.
\[13]And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.
\[14]Then on Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the middle of the congregation;
\[15]And he said, Listen you, all Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you king Jehoshaphat, Thus said the LORD to you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.
\[16]To morrow go you down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and you shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.
\[17]You shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand you still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you.
\[18]And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshipping the LORD.
\[19]And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.
\[20]And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall you be established; believe his prophets, so shall you prosper.
\[21]And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers to the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endures for ever.
\[22]And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.
\[23]For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.
\[24]And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked to the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.
\[25]And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.
\[26]And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, to this day.
\[27]Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.
\[28]And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets to the house of the LORD.
\[29]And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.
\[30]So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.
\[31]And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
\[32]And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.
\[33]However, the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts to the God of their fathers.
\[34]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.

\[36]And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongaber.
\[37]Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because you have joined yourself with Ahaziah, the LORD has broken your works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.

\[6]And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he worked that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.
\[7]However, the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.
\[8]In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.
\[9]Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.
\[10]So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day.  The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.
\[11]Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto.
\[12]And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus said the LORD God of David your father, Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
\[13]But have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the prostitutions of the house of Ahab, and also have slain your brothers of your father's house, which were better than yourself:
\[14]Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite your people, and your children, and your wives, and all your goods:
\[15]And you shall have great sickness by disease of your bowels, until your bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.
\[16]Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:
\[17]And they came up into Judah, and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
\[18]And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.
\[19]And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.
\[20]Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. However, they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchers of the kings.

nd the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the oldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.
\[2]Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.
\[3]He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly.
\[4]Why he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction.
\[5]He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.
\[6]And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.
\[7]And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.
\[8]And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.
\[9]And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.
\[10]But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.
\[11]But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.
\[12]And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.

nd in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.
\[2]And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
\[3]And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD has said of the sons of David.
\[4]This is the thing that you shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors;
\[5]And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.
\[6]But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.
\[7]And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever else comes into the house, he shall be put to death: but be you with the king when he comes in, and when he goes out.
\[8]So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.
\[9]Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God.
\[10]And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.
\[11]Then they brought out the king's son, and put on him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.
\[12]Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:
\[13]And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of music, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.
\[14]Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said to them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoever follows her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.
\[15]So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.
\[16]And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD's people.
\[17]Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and broke it down, and broke his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
\[18]Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.
\[19]And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.
\[20]And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king on the throne of the kingdom.
\[21]And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.

oash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Zibiah of Beersheba.
\[2]And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
\[3]And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.
\[4]And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD.
\[5]And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that you hasten the matter. However, the Levites hastened it not.
\[6]And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, Why have you not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?
\[7]For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow on Baalim.
\[8]And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.
\[9]And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness.
\[10]And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
\[11]Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought to the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.
\[12]And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as worked iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.
\[13]So the workmen worked, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.
\[14]And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer with, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.
\[15]But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.
\[16]And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.
\[17]Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king listened to them.
\[18]And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.
\[19]Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again to the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.
\[20]And the Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said to them, Thus said God, Why transgress you the commandments of the LORD, that you cannot prosper? because you have forsaken the LORD, he has also forsaken you.
\[21]And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.
\[22]Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look on it, and require it.
\[23]And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them to the king of Damascus.
\[24]For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.
\[25]And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchers of the kings.
\[26]And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.
\[27]Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid on him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

maziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
\[2]And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.
\[3]Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.
\[4]But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.
\[5]Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.
\[6]He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.
\[7]But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with you; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.
\[8]But if you will go, do it; be strong for the battle: God shall make you fall before the enemy: for God has power to help, and to cast down.
\[9]And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give you much more than this.
\[10]Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: why their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.
\[11]And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.
\[12]And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.
\[13]But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.
\[14]Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them.
\[15]Why the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, which said to him, Why have you sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of your hand?
\[16]And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said to him, Are you made of the king's counsel? forbear; why should you be smitten? Then the prophet declined, and said, I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this, and have not listened to my counsel.
\[17]Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.
\[18]And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and stepped down the thistle.
\[19]You say, See, you have smitten the Edomites; and your heart lifts you up to boast: abide now at home; why should you meddle to your hurt, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?
\[20]But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.
\[21]So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which belongs to Judah.
\[22]And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.
\[23]And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
\[24]And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
\[25]And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
\[26]Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
\[27]Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.
\[28]And they brought him on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.

\[2]He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
\[3]Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
\[4]And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did.
\[5]And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.
\[6]And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
\[7]And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelled in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.
\[8]And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly.
\[9]Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.
\[10]Also he built towers in the desert, and dig many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: farmers also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.
\[11]Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.
\[12]The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valor were two thousand and six hundred.
\[13]And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
\[14]And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.
\[15]And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and on the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones with.  And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong.
\[16]But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.
\[17]And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:
\[18]And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said to him, It appertains not to you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for you have trespassed; neither shall it be for your honor from the LORD God.
\[19]Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.
\[20]And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked on him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from there; yes, himself hurried also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.
\[21]And Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelled in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.
\[22]Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.
\[23]So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.

\[2]For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.
\[3]Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
\[4]He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
\[5]Why the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.
\[6]For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.
\[7]And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.
\[8]And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
\[9]But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage that reaches up to heaven.
\[10]And now you purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for slaves and bondwomen to you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?
\[11]Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which you have taken captive of your brothers: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is on you.
\[12]Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,
\[13]And said to them, You shall not bring in the captives here: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, you intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.
\[14]So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.
\[15]And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them on asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers: then they returned to Samaria.
\[16]At that time did king Ahaz send to the kings of Assyria to help him.
\[17]For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.
\[18]The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelled there.
\[19]For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.
\[20]And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.
\[21]For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.
\[22]And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.
\[23]For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
\[24]And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
\[25]And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.
\[26]Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\[27]And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchers of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

\[6]For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.
\[7]Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.
\[8]Why the wrath of the LORD was on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as you see with your eyes.
\[9]For, see, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
\[10]Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.
\[11]My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD has chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that you should minister to him, and burn incense.
\[12]Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:
\[13]And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:
\[14]And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.
\[15]And they gathered their brothers, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.
\[16]And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron.
\[17]Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
\[18]Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the show bread table, with all the vessels thereof.
\[19]Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the LORD.
\[20]Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.
\[21]And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD.
\[22]So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood on the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood on the altar.
\[23]And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands on them:
\[24]And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood on the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.
\[25]And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.
\[26]And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
\[27]And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering on the altar.  And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel.
\[28]And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.
\[29]And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.
\[30]Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise to the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.
\[31]Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now you have consecrated yourselves to the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.
\[32]And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was three score and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.
\[33]And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
\[34]But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: why their brothers the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
\[35]And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.
\[36]And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.

nd Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover to the LORD God of Israel.
\[2]For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.
\[3]For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
\[4]And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
\[5]So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover to the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written.
\[6]So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, You children of Israel, turn again to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.
\[7]And be not you like your fathers, and like your brothers, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as you see.
\[8]Now be you not stiff necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.
\[9]For if you turn again to the LORD, your brothers and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if you return to him.
\[10]So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even to Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
\[11]Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
\[12]Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.
\[13]And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.
\[14]And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.
\[15]Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.
\[16]And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.
\[17]For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them to the LORD.
\[18]For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one
\[19]That prepares his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.
\[20]And the LORD listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
\[21]And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments to the LORD.
\[22]And Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.
\[23]And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness.
\[24]For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
\[25]And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelled in Judah, rejoiced.
\[26]So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.
\[27]Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even to heaven.

ow when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.
\[2]And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.
\[3]He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.
\[4]Moreover he commanded the people that dwelled in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.
\[5]And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the first fruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.
\[6]And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelled in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.
\[7]In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
\[8]And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.
\[9]Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
\[10]And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD has blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.
\[11]Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them,
\[12]And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next.
\[13]And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.
\[14]And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.
\[15]And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set office, to give to their brothers by courses, as well to the great as to the small:
\[16]Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even to every one that enters into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;
\[17]Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;
\[18]And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:
\[19]Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.
\[20]And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and worked that which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.
\[21]And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.

fter these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself.
\[2]And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,
\[3]He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him.
\[4]So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the middle of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?
\[5]Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.
\[6]And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spoke comfortably to them, saying,
\[7]Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him:
\[8]With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
\[9]After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,
\[10]Thus said Sennacherib king of Assyria, Where on do you trust, that you abide in the siege in Jerusalem?
\[11]Does not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\[12]Has not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, You shall worship before one altar, and burn incense on it?
\[13]Know you not what I and my fathers have done to all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of my hand?
\[14]Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?
\[15]Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?
\[16]And his servants spoke yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.
\[17]He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand.
\[18]Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech to the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.
\[19]And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.
\[20]And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.
\[21]And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.
\[22]Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side.
\[23]And many brought gifts to the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thereafter.
\[24]In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed to the LORD: and he spoke to him, and he gave him a sign.
\[25]But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done to him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath on him, and on Judah and Jerusalem.
\[26]Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not on them in the days of Hezekiah.
\[27]And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;
\[28]Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.
\[29]Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.
\[30]This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
\[31]However, in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.
\[32]Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\[33]And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the most chief of the sepulchers of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

anasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:
\[2]But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
\[3]For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
\[4]Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.
\[5]And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
\[6]And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he worked much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
\[7]And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
\[8]Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.
\[9]So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.
\[10]And the LORD spoke to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not listen.
\[11]Why the LORD brought on them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
\[12]And when he was in affliction, he sought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,
\[13]And prayed to him: and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.
\[14]Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.
\[15]And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.
\[16]And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.
\[17]Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet to the LORD their God only.
\[18]Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.
\[19]His prayer also, and how God was entreated of him, and all his sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.
\[20]So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
\[21]Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.
\[22]But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed to all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;
\[23]And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.
\[24]And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.
\[25]But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.

osiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.
\[2]And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left.
\[3]For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.
\[4]And they broke down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it on the graves of them that had sacrificed to them.
\[5]And he burnt the bones of the priests on their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
\[6]And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even to Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.
\[7]And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.
\[8]Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.
\[9]And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.
\[10]And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that worked in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:
\[11]Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
\[12]And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of music.
\[13]Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that worked the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.
\[14]And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses.
\[15]And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.
\[16]And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to your servants, they do it.
\[17]And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.
\[18]Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
\[19]And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.
\[20]And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,
\[21]Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.
\[22]And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spoke to her to that effect.
\[23]And she answered them, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Tell you the man that sent you to me,
\[24]Thus said the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:
\[25]Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out on this place, and shall not be quenched.
\[26]And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, so shall you say to him, Thus said the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which you have heard;
\[27]Because your heart was tender, and you did humble yourself before God, when you heard his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbled yourself before me, and did rend your clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard you also, said the LORD.
\[28]Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil that I will bring on this place, and on the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.
\[29]Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
\[30]And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.
\[31]And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.
\[32]And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
\[33]And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.

oreover Josiah kept a passover to the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
\[2]And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,
\[3]And said to the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy to the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden on your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,
\[4]And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.
\[5]And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brothers the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.
\[6]So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brothers, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
\[7]And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance.
\[8]And his princes gave willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen.
\[9]Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave to the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.
\[10]So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.
\[11]And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.
\[12]And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer to the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.
\[13]And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.
\[14]And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
\[15]And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brothers the Levites prepared for them.
\[16]So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.
\[17]And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
\[18]And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[19]In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.
\[20]After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.
\[21]But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? I come not against you this day, but against the house with which I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear you from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy you not.
\[22]Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and listened not to the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
\[23]And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.
\[24]His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchers of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
\[25]And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.
\[26]Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,
\[27]And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

hen the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.
\[2]Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
\[3]And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
\[4]And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
\[5]Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.
\[6]Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
\[7]Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
\[8]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
\[9]Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.
\[10]And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.
\[11]Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
\[12]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORD.
\[13]And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning to the LORD God of Israel.
\[14]Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.
\[15]And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:
\[16]But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy.
\[17]Therefore he brought on them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand.
\[18]And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.
\[19]And they burnt the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.
\[20]And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:
\[21]To fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfill three score and ten years.
\[22]Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,
\[23]Thus said Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth has the LORD God of heaven given me; and he has charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people?  The LORD his God be with him, and let him go up.

\[2]Thus said Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he has charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
\[3]Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.
\[4]And whoever remains in any place where he sojournes, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.
\[5]Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.
\[6]And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered.
\[7]Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;
\[8]Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
\[9]And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,
\[10]Thirty basins of gold, silver basins of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.
\[11]All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem.

nd when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.
\[2]Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brothers, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.
\[3]And they set the altar on his bases; for fear was on them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon to the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening.
\[4]They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;
\[5]And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering to the LORD.
\[6]From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings to the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.
\[7]They gave money also to the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, to them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
\[8]Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.
\[9]Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brothers the Levites.
\[10]And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.
\[11]And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks to the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endures for ever toward Israel.  And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.
\[12]But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:
\[13]So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.

ow when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity built the temple to the LORD God of Israel;
\[2]Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said to them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as you do; and we do sacrifice to him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up here.
\[3]But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said to them, You have nothing to do with us to build an house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.
\[4]Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,
\[5]And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
\[6]And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they to him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
\[7]And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.
\[8]Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:

\[10]And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time.
\[11]This is the copy of the letter that they sent to him, even to Artaxerxes the king; Your servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time.
\[12]Be it known to the king, that the Jews which came up from you to us are come to Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.
\[13]Be it known now to the king, that, if this city be built, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so you shall damage the revenue of the kings.
\[14]Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king;
\[15]That search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers: so shall you find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.
\[16]We certify the king that, if this city be built again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means you shall have no portion on this side the river.
\[17]Then sent the king an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and to the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.
\[18]The letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me.
\[19]And I commanded, and search has been made, and it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.
\[20]There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid to them.
\[21]Give you now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until another commandment shall be given from me.
\[22]Take heed now that you fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
\[23]Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.
\[24]Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased to the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.

\[11]And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was built these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and set up.
\[12]But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.
\[13]But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.
\[14]And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;
\[15]And said to him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in his place.
\[16]Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now has it been in building, and yet it is not finished.
\[17]Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.

\[2]And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written:
\[3]In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be built, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof three score cubits, and the breadth thereof three score cubits;
\[4]With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:
\[5]And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and brought again to the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God.
\[6]Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be you far from there:
\[7]Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.
\[8]Moreover I make a decree what you shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, immediately expenses be given to these men, that they be not hindered.
\[9]And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:
\[10]That they may offer sacrifices of sweet smells to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.
\[11]Also I have made a decree, that whoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.
\[12]And the God that has caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.
\[13]Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily.

And they built, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
\[15]And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
\[16]And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.
\[17]And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
\[18]And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.
\[19]And the children of the captivity kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
\[20]For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brothers the priests, and for themselves.
\[21]And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,
\[22]And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.

\[2]The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
\[3]The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
\[4]The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
\[5]The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest:
\[6]This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God on him.
\[7]And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.
\[8]And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.
\[9]For on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God on him.
\[10]For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.
\[11]Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.
\[12]Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time.
\[13]I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with you.
\[14]For as much as you are sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of your God which is in your hand;
\[15]And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,
\[16]And all the silver and gold that you can find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem:
\[17]That you may buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.
\[18]And whatever shall seem good to you, and to your brothers, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God.
\[19]The vessels also that are given you for the service of the house of your God, those deliver you before the God of Jerusalem.
\[20]And whatever more shall be needful for the house of your God, which you shall have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house.
\[21]And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily,
\[22]To an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.
\[23]Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
\[24]Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, on them.
\[25]And you, Ezra, after the wisdom of your God, that is in your hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of your God; and teach you them that know them not.
\[26]And whoever will not do the law of your God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily on him, whether it be to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
\[27]Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which has put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem:
\[28]And has extended mercy to me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was on me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.

\[2]Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush.
\[3]Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty.
\[4]Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males.
\[5]Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males.
\[6]Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males.
\[7]And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males.
\[8]And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him fourscore males.
\[9]Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males.
\[10]And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him an hundred and three score males.
\[11]And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight males.
\[12]And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him an hundred and ten males.
\[13]And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them three score males.
\[14]Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.
\[15]And I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava; and there stayed we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.
\[16]Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.
\[17]And I sent them with commandment to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say to Iddo, and to his brothers the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.
\[18]And by the good hand of our God on us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brothers, eighteen;
\[19]And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty;
\[20]Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.
\[21]Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
\[22]For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God is on all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.
\[23]So we fasted and sought our God for this: and he was entreated of us.
\[24]Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,
\[25]And weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:
\[26]I even weighed to their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents;
\[27]Also twenty basins of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.
\[28]And I said to them, You are holy to the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD God of your fathers.
\[29]Watch you, and keep them, until you weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.
\[30]So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.
\[31]Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.
\[32]And we came to Jerusalem, and stayed there three days.
\[33]Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;
\[34]By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.
\[35]Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering to the LORD.
\[36]And they delivered the king's commissions to the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.

ow when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
\[2]For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.
\[3]And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonished.
\[4]Then were assembled to me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonished until the evening sacrifice.
\[5]And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell on my knees, and spread out my hands to the LORD my God,
\[6]And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up to the heavens.
\[7]Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass to this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.
\[8]And now for a little space grace has been showed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
\[9]For we were slaves; yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
\[10]And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken your commandments,
\[11]Which you have commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, The land, to which you go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.
\[12]Now therefore give not your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that you may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.
\[13]And after all that is come on us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that you our God have punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us such deliverance as this;
\[14]Should we again break your commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? would not you be angry with us till you had consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?
\[15]O LORD God of Israel, you are righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before you in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before you because of this.

ow when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled to him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.
\[2]And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.
\[3]Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
\[4]Arise; for this matter belongs to you: we also will be with you: be of good courage, and do it.
\[5]Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they swore.
\[6]Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.
\[7]And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem;
\[8]And that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.
\[9]Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.
\[10]And Ezra the priest stood up, and said to them, You have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.
\[11]Now therefore make confession to the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives.
\[12]Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As you have said, so must we do.
\[13]But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.
\[14]Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.
\[15]Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
\[16]And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
\[17]And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.
\[18]And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.
\[19]And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass.

he words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,
\[2]That Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
\[3]And they said to me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.
\[4]And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,
\[5]And said, I beseech you, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keeps covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:
\[6]Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may hear the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you now, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you: both I and my father's house have sinned.
\[7]We have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which you commanded your servant Moses.
\[8]Remember, I beseech you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, If you transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:
\[9]But if you turn to me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out to the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen to set my name there.
\[10]Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand.
\[11]O LORD, I beseech you, let now your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who desire to fear your name: and prosper, I pray you, your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.

nd it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.
\[2]Why the king said to me, Why is your countenance sad, seeing you are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,
\[3]And said to the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchers, lies waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?
\[4]Then the king said to me, For what do you make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.
\[5]And I said to the king, If it please the king, and if your servant have found favor in your sight, that you would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' sepulchers, that I may build it.
\[6]And the king said to me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall your journey be? and when will you return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
\[7]Moreover I said to the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;
\[8]And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God on me.
\[9]Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.
\[10]When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
\[11]So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
\[12]And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode on.
\[13]And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.
\[14]Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.
\[15]Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.
\[16]And the rulers knew not where I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.
\[17]Then said I to them, You see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.
\[18]Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good on me; as also the king's words that he had spoken to me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.
\[19]But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that you do? will you rebel against the king?
\[20]Then answered I them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.

ut it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we built the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.
\[2]And he spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice?  will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?
\[3]Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.
\[4]Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach on their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:
\[5]And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before you: for they have provoked you to anger before the builders.
\[6]So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together to the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.
\[7]But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,
\[8]And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.
\[9]Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.
\[10]And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.
\[11]And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the middle among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.
\[12]And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelled by them came, they said to us ten times, From all places from where you shall return to us they will be on you.
\[13]Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
\[14]And I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not you afraid of them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
\[15]And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to nothing, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one to his work.
\[16]And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants worked in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.
\[17]They which built on the wall, and they that bore burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands worked in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.
\[18]For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so built. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.
\[19]And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated on the wall, one far from another.
\[20]In what place therefore you hear the sound of the trumpet, resort you thither to us: our God shall fight for us.
\[21]So we labored in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
\[22]Likewise at the same time said I to the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labor on the day.
\[23]So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing.

nd there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews.
\[2]For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.
\[3]Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.
\[4]There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that on our lands and vineyards.
\[5]Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children: and, see, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought to bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.
\[6]And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
\[7]Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said to them, You exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.
\[8]And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brothers the Jews, which were sold to the heathen; and will you even sell your brothers? or shall they be sold to us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.
\[9]Also I said, It is not good that you do: ought you not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?
\[10]I likewise, and my brothers, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.
\[11]Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that you exact of them.
\[12]Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as you say. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.
\[13]Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performes not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.
\[14]Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor.
\[15]But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable to the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yes, even their servants bore rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.
\[16]Yes, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither to the work.
\[17]Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came to us from among the heathen that are about us.
\[18]Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy on this people.
\[19]Think on me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.

ow it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors on the gates;)
\[2]That Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
\[3]And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?
\[4]Yet they sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.
\[5]Then sent Sanballat his servant to me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;
\[6]Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu said it, that you and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause you build the wall, that you may be their king, according to these words.
\[7]And you have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.
\[8]Then I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as you say, but you feign them out of your own heart.
\[9]For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.
\[10]Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay you; yes, in the night will they come to slay you.
\[11]And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.
\[12]And, see, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
\[13]Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
\[14]My God, think you on Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
\[15]So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.
\[16]And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was worked of our God.
\[17]Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came to them.
\[18]For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
\[19]Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.

ow it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
\[2]That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.
\[3]And I said to them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.
\[4]Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not built.
\[5]And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,
\[6]These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one to his city;
\[7]Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was this;

\[44]The singers: the children of Asaph, an hundred forty and eight.
\[45]The porters: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, the children of Shobai, an hundred thirty and eight.

\[58]The children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel,
\[59]The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon.
\[60]All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two.
\[61]And these were they which went up also from Telmelah, Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not show their father's house, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel.
\[62]The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.
\[63]And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai, which took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called after their name.
\[64]These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.
\[65]And the Tirshatha said to them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim.
\[66]The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and three score,
\[67]Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.
\[68]Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two hundred forty and five:
\[69]Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses.
\[70]And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests' garments.
\[71]And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver.
\[72]And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and three score and seven priests' garments.
\[73]So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelled in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities.

nd all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel.
\[2]And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month.
\[3]And he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law.
\[4]And Ezra the scribe stood on a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
\[5]And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:
\[6]And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground.
\[7]Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place.
\[8]So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.
\[9]And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said to all the people, This day is holy to the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.
\[10]Then he said to them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy to our LORD: neither be you sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.
\[11]So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be you grieved.
\[12]And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.
\[13]And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.
\[14]And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:
\[15]And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.
\[16]So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one on the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.
\[17]And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.
\[18]Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the manner.

\[2]And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
\[3]And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God.
\[4]Then stood up on the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice to the LORD their God.
\[5]Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
\[6]You, even you, are LORD alone; you have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and you preserve them all; and the host of heaven worships you.
\[7]You are the LORD the God, who did choose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham;
\[8]And found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and have performed your words; for you are righteous:
\[9]And did see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red sea;
\[10]And showed signs and wonders on Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for you knew that they dealt proudly against them. So did you get you a name, as it is this day.
\[11]And you did divide the sea before them, so that they went through the middle of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors you threw into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.
\[12]Moreover you led them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.
\[13]You came down also on mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:
\[14]And made known to them your holy sabbath, and commanded them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses your servant:
\[15]And gave them bread from heaven for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promised them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them.
\[16]But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and listened not to your commandments,
\[17]And refused to obey, neither were mindful of your wonders that you did among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsook them not.
\[18]Yes, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is your God that brought you up out of Egypt, and had worked great provocations;
\[19]Yet you in your manifold mercies forsook them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go.
\[20]You gave also your good spirit to instruct them, and withheld not your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.
\[21]Yes, forty years did you sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.
\[22]Moreover you gave them kingdoms and nations, and did divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.
\[23]Their children also multiplied you as the stars of heaven, and brought them into the land, concerning which you had promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.
\[24]So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
\[25]And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells dig, vineyards, and olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.
\[26]Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their backs, and slew your prophets which testified against them to turn them to you, and they worked great provocations.
\[27]Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard them from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.
\[28]But after they had rest, they did evil again before you: therefore left you them in the land of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried to you, you heard them from heaven; and many times did you deliver them according to your mercies;
\[29]And testified against them, that you might bring them again to your law: yet they dealt proudly, and listened not to your commandments, but sinned against your judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
\[30]Yet many years did you forbear them, and testified against them by your spirit in your prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gave you them into the hand of the people of the lands.
\[31]Nevertheless for your great mercies' sake you did not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God.
\[32]Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keep covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before you, that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.
\[33]However, you are just in all that is brought on us; for you have done right, but we have done wickedly:
\[34]Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept your law, nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies, with which you did testify against them.
\[35]For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and fat land which you gave before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.
\[36]Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it:
\[37]And it yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.
\[38]And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal to it.

\[10]And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada,
\[11]And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.

\[23]The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
\[24]And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward.
\[25]Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.
\[26]These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.
\[27]And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
\[28]And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi;
\[29]Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had built them villages round about Jerusalem.
\[30]And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
\[31]Then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate:
\[32]And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
\[33]And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
\[34]Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
\[35]And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:
\[36]And his brothers, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.
\[37]And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water gate eastward.
\[38]And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them, and I after them, and the half of the people on the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even to the broad wall;
\[39]And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.
\[40]So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:
\[41]And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
\[42]And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.
\[43]Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
\[44]And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.
\[45]And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.
\[46]For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
\[47]And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things to the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them to the children of Aaron.

n that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;
\[2]Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: however, our God turned the curse into a blessing.
\[3]Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
\[4]And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied to Tobiah:
\[5]And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.
\[6]But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I to the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:
\[7]And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
\[8]And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber.
\[9]Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.
\[10]And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.
\[11]Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.
\[12]Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries.
\[13]And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute to their brothers.
\[14]Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.
\[15]In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.
\[16]There dwelled men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
\[17]Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that you do, and profane the sabbath day?
\[18]Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil on us, and on this city? yet you bring more wrath on Israel by profaning the sabbath.
\[19]And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
\[20]So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.
\[21]Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why lodge you about the wall? if you do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.
\[22]And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day.  Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your mercy.
\[23]In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:
\[24]And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.
\[25]And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters to your sons, or for yourselves.
\[26]Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.
\[27]Shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?
\[28]And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.
\[29]Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
\[30]Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;
\[31]And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the first fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

ow it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even to Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)
\[2]That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,
\[3]In the third year of his reign, he made a feast to all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:
\[4]When he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.
\[5]And when these days were expired, the king made a feast to all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both to great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;
\[6]Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, on a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.
\[7]And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.
\[8]And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.
\[9]Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
\[10]On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,
\[11]To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.
\[12]But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.
\[13]Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:
\[14]And the next to him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)
\[15]What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law, because she has not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
\[16]And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen has not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
\[17]For this deed of the queen shall come abroad to all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.
\[18]Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day to all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.
\[19]If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another that is better than she.
\[20]And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.
\[21]And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:
\[22]For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.

fter these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
\[2]Then said the king's servants that ministered to him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:
\[3]And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins to Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, to the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:
\[4]And let the maiden which pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.  And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
\[5]Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;
\[6]Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
\[7]And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.
\[8]So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also to the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
\[9]And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids to the best place of the house of the women.
\[10]Esther had not showed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not show it.
\[11]And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.
\[12]Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)
\[13]Then thus came every maiden to the king; whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women to the king's house.
\[14]In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in to the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.
\[15]Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked on her.
\[16]So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
\[17]And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
\[18]Then the king made a great feast to all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.
\[19]And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.
\[20]Esther had not yet showed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.
\[21]In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.
\[22]And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it to Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name.
\[23]And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.

fter these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.
\[2]And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.
\[3]Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said to Mordecai, Why transgress you the king's commandment?
\[4]Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he listened not to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.
\[5]And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.
\[6]And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had showed him the people of Mordecai: why Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.
\[7]In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.
\[8]And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.
\[9]If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.
\[10]And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.
\[11]And the king said to Haman, The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.
\[12]Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded to the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.
\[13]And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.
\[14]The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published to all people, that they should be ready against that day.
\[15]The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.

hen Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the middle of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;
\[2]And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.
\[3]And in every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
\[4]So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.
\[5]Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend on her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.
\[6]So Hatach went forth to Mordecai to the street of the city, which was before the king's gate.
\[7]And Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
\[8]Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to charge her that she should go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him for her people.
\[9]And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
\[10]Again Esther spoke to Hatach, and gave him commandment to Mordecai;
\[11]All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whoever, whether man or women, shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.
\[12]And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.
\[13]Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with yourself that you shall escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.
\[14]For if you altogether hold your peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but you and your father's house shall be destroyed: and who knows whether you are come to the kingdom for such a time as this?
\[15]Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,
\[16]Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast you for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in to the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.

\[2]And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the scepter.
\[3]Then said the king to her, What will you, queen Esther? and what is your request? it shall be even given you to the half of the kingdom.
\[4]And Esther answered, If it seem good to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.
\[5]Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther has said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
\[6]And the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What is your petition? and it shall be granted you: and what is your request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.

\[9]Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.
\[10]Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.
\[11]And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.
\[12]Haman said moreover, Yes, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited to her also with the king.
\[13]Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.

\[8]Let the royal apparel be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and the crown royal which is set on his head:
\[9]And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man with whom the king delights to honor, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.
\[10]Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as you have said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sits at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that you have spoken.

\[4]For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for slaves and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage.

\[6]And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.
\[7]And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.

\[6]For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come to my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
\[7]Then the king Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged on the gallows, because he laid his hand on the Jews.
\[8]Write you also for the Jews, as it likes you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.
\[9]Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India to Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.
\[10]And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:

\[2]The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell on all people.
\[3]And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell on them.
\[4]For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.
\[5]Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would to those that hated them.
\[6]And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.

\[13]Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows.
\[14]And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.
\[15]For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.
\[16]But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,
\[17]On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
\[18]But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
\[19]Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelled in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.
\[20]And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both near and far,
\[21]To establish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,
\[22]As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.
\[23]And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written to them;
\[24]Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;
\[25]But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
\[26]Why they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.  Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come to them,
\[27]The Jews ordained, and took on them, and on their seed, and on all such as joined themselves to them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year;
\[28]And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.
\[29]Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.
\[30]And he sent the letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,
\[31]To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.

\[2]And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
\[3]His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
\[4]And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
\[5]And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
\[6]Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.
\[7]And the LORD said to Satan, From where come you? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
\[8]And the LORD said to Satan, Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God, and eschews evil?
\[9]Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?
\[10]Have not you made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has on every side? you have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
\[11]But put forth your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face.
\[12]And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your power; only on himself put not forth your hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.
\[13]And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house:
\[14]And there came a messenger to Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:
\[15]And the Sabeans fell on them, and took them away; yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.
\[16]While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and has burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.
\[17]While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell on the camels, and have carried them away, yes, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.
\[18]While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house:
\[19]And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.
\[20]Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped,
\[21]And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.

\[12]And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven.

\[12]Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?
\[13]For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
\[14]With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;
\[15]Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:
\[16]Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.
\[17]There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
\[18]There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
\[19]The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.
\[20]Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul;
\[21]Which long for death, but it comes not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
\[22]Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?
\[23]Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God has hedged in?
\[24]For my sighing comes before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
\[25]For the thing which I greatly feared is come on me, and that which I was afraid of is come to me.
\[26]I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.

\[3]Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands.
\[4]Your words have upheld him that was falling, and you have strengthened the feeble knees.
\[5]But now it is come on you, and you faint; it touches you, and you are troubled.
\[6]Is not this your fear, your confidence, your hope, and the uprightness of your ways?
\[7]Remember, I pray you, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?
\[8]Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
\[9]By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
\[10]The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
\[11]The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.
\[12]Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a little thereof.
\[13]In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,
\[14]Fear came on me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
\[15]Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
\[16]It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before my eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,
\[17]Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
\[18]Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:
\[19]How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?
\[20]They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.

\[2]For wrath kills the foolish man, and envy slays the silly one.
\[3]I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
\[4]His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.
\[5]Whose harvest the hungry eats up, and takes it even out of the thorns, and the robber swallows up their substance.
\[6]Although affliction comes not forth of the dust, neither does trouble spring out of the ground;
\[7]Yet man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
\[8]I would seek to God, and to God would I commit my cause:
\[9]Which does great things and unsearchable; marvelous things without number:
\[10]Who gives rain on the earth, and sends waters on the fields:
\[11]To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
\[12]He disappoints the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.
\[13]He takes the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the fraudulent is carried headlong.
\[14]They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in the night.
\[15]But he saves the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.
\[16]So the poor has hope, and iniquity stops her mouth.
\[17]Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects: therefore despise not you the chastening of the Almighty:
\[18]For he makes sore, and binds up: he wounds, and his hands make whole.
\[19]He shall deliver you in six troubles: yes, in seven there shall no evil touch you.
\[20]In famine he shall redeem you from death: and in war from the power of the sword.
\[21]You shall be hid from the whip of the tongue: neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes.
\[22]At destruction and famine you shall laugh: neither shall you be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
\[23]For you shall be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.
\[24]And you shall know that your tabernacle shall be in peace; and you shall visit your habitation, and shall not sin.
\[25]You shall know also that your seed shall be great, and your offspring as the grass of the earth.
\[26]You shall come to your grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn comes in in his season.

\[20]The wicked man travails with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.
\[21]A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come on him.
\[22]He believes not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.
\[23]He wanders abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
\[24]Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
\[25]For he stretches out his hand against God, and strengthens himself against the Almighty.
\[26]He runs on him, even on his neck, on the thick bosses of his bucklers:
\[27]Because he covers his face with his fatness, and makes bulges of fat on his flanks.
\[28]And he dwells in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabits, which are ready to become heaps.
\[29]He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof on the earth.
\[30]He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
\[31]Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompense.
\[32]It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.
\[33]He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.
\[34]For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.
\[35]They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepares deceit.

\[10]They have gaped on me with their mouth; they have smitten me on the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.
\[11]God has delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.

\[17]Not for any injustice in my hands: also my prayer is pure.
\[18]O earth, cover not you my blood, and let my cry have no place.
\[19]Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.
\[20]My friends scorn me: but my eye pours out tears to God.

\[27]Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yes, and searched it out.
\[28]And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.

oreover Job continued his parable, and said,
\[2]Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;
\[3]When his candle shined on my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;
\[4]As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was on my tabernacle;
\[5]When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;
\[6]When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
\[7]When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!
\[8]The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.
\[9]The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.
\[10]The nobles held their peace, and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.
\[11]When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:
\[12]Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.
\[13]The blessing of him that was ready to perish came on me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
\[14]I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.
\[15]I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.
\[16]I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.
\[17]And I broke the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.
\[18]Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.
\[19]My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night on my branch.
\[20]My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
\[21]To me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.
\[22]After my words they spoke not again; and my speech dropped on them.
\[23]And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.
\[24]If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.
\[25]I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelled as a king in the army, as one that comforts the mourners.

\[2]Yes, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?
\[3]For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.

\[5]They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)
\[6]To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.

\[8]They were children of fools, yes, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.
\[9]And now am I their song, yes, I am their byword.
\[10]They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
\[11]Because he has loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.

\[13]They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.
\[14]They came on me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves on me.
\[15]Terrors are turned on me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passes away as a cloud.
\[16]And now my soul is poured out on me; the days of affliction have taken hold on me.
\[17]My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
\[18]By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it binds me about as the collar of my coat.
\[19]He has cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.
\[20]I cry to you, and you do not hear me: I stand up, and you regard me not.
\[21]You are become cruel to me: with your strong hand you oppose yourself against me.
\[22]You lift me up to the wind; you cause me to ride on it, and dissolve my substance.
\[23]For I know that you will bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.
\[24]However, he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.
\[25]Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?
\[26]When I looked for good, then evil came to me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
\[27]My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.
\[28]I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.
\[29]I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
\[30]My skin is black on me, and my bones are burned with heat.
\[31]My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.

\[21]If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:
\[22]Then let my arm fall from my shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from the bone.
\[23]For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
\[24]If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, You are my confidence;
\[25]If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gotten much;
\[26]If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;
\[27]And my heart has been secretly enticed, or my mouth has kissed my hand:

\[30]Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
\[31]If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh!  we cannot be satisfied.

\[33]If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom:
\[34]Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?

o these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
\[2]Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
\[3]Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
\[4]Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
\[5]When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
\[6]And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and you are very old; why I was afraid, and dared not show you my opinion.
\[7]I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
\[8]But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty gives them understanding.
\[9]Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.
\[10]Therefore I said, Listen to me; I also will show my opinion.
\[11]Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst you searched out what to say.
\[12]Yes, I attended to you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:

\[17]I said, I will answer also my part, I also will show my opinion.
\[18]For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constrains me.
\[19]Behold, my belly is as wine which has no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.
\[20]I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.
\[21]Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles to man.

\[4]The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty has given me life.
\[5]If you can answer me, set your words in order before me, stand up.
\[6]Behold, I am according to your wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.
\[7]Behold, my terror shall not make you afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy on you.

\[9]I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.
\[10]Behold, he finds occasions against me, he counts me for his enemy,
\[11]He puts my feet in the stocks, he marks all my paths.
\[12]Behold, in this you are not just: I will answer you, that God is greater than man.
\[13]Why do you strive against him? for he gives not account of any of his matters.
\[14]For God speaks once, yes twice, yet man perceives it not.
\[15]In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, in slumberings on the bed;
\[16]Then he opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction,
\[17]That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
\[18]He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
\[19]He is chastened also with pain on his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:
\[20]So that his life abhors bread, and his soul dainty meat.
\[21]His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.
\[22]Yes, his soul draws near to the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
\[23]If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man his uprightness:
\[24]Then he is gracious to him, and said, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.
\[25]His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:
\[26]He shall pray to God, and he will be favorable to him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render to man his righteousness.
\[27]He looks on men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;
\[28]He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
\[29]See, all these things works God oftentimes with man,
\[30]To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
\[31]Mark well, O Job, listen to me: hold your peace, and I will speak.
\[32]If you have anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify you.

\[2]Hear my words, O you wise men; and give ear to me, you that have knowledge.
\[3]For the ear tries words, as the mouth tastes meat.
\[4]Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.
\[5]For Job has said, I am righteous: and God has taken away my judgment.
\[6]Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.
\[7]What man is like Job, who drinks up scorning like water?
\[8]Which goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men.
\[9]For he has said, It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
\[10]Therefore listen to me you men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
\[11]For the work of a man shall he render to him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.
\[12]Yes, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
\[13]Who has given him a charge over the earth? or who has disposed the whole world?
\[14]If he set his heart on man, if he gather to himself his spirit and his breath;
\[15]All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again to dust.
\[16]If now you have understanding, hear this: listen to the voice of my words.
\[17]Shall even he that hates right govern? and will you condemn him that is most just?
\[18]Is it fit to say to a king, You are wicked? and to princes, You are ungodly?
\[19]How much less to him that accepts not the persons of princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.
\[20]In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
\[21]For his eyes are on the ways of man, and he sees all his goings.
\[22]There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
\[23]For he will not lay on man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
\[24]He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
\[25]Therefore he knows their works, and he overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
\[26]He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
\[27]Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
\[28]So that they cause the cry of the poor to come to him, and he hears the cry of the afflicted.
\[29]When he gives quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hides his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:
\[30]That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
\[31]Surely it is meet to be said to God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:
\[32]That which I see not teach you me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
\[33]Should it be according to your mind? he will recompense it, whether you refuse, or whether you choose; and not I: therefore speak what you know.
\[34]Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man listen to me.
\[35]Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.
\[36]My desire is that Job may be tried to the end because of his answers for wicked men.

\[4]For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with you.
\[5]Behold, God is mighty, and despises not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.
\[6]He preserves not the life of the wicked: but gives right to the poor.
\[7]He withdraws not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yes, he does establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
\[8]And if they be bound in fetters, and be held in cords of affliction;
\[9]Then he shows them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
\[10]He opens also their ear to discipline, and commands that they return from iniquity.
\[11]If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
\[12]But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
\[13]But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he binds them.
\[14]They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.
\[15]He delivers the poor in his affliction, and opens their ears in oppression.
\[16]Even so would he have removed you out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no narrow place; and that which should be set on your table should be full of fatness.
\[17]But you have fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on you.
\[18]Because there is wrath, beware lest he take you away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver you.
\[19]Will he esteem your riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
\[20]Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
\[21]Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this have you chosen rather than affliction.

\[23]Who has enjoined him his way? or who can say, You have worked iniquity?
\[24]Remember that you magnify his work, which men behold.
\[25]Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
\[26]Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.

\[28]Which the clouds do drop and distil on man abundantly.
\[29]Also can any understand the spreading of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?
\[30]Behold, he spreads his light on it, and covers the bottom of the sea.

\[22]He mocks at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turns he back from the sword.
\[23]The quiver rattles against him, the glittering spear and the shield.
\[24]He swallows the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believes he that it is the sound of the trumpet.
\[25]He said among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smells the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
\[26]Does the hawk fly by your wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?
\[27]Does the eagle mount up at your command, and make her nest on high?

\[18]His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.
\[19]He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach to him.
\[20]Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
\[21]He lies under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.
\[22]The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.

\[3]Who is he that hides counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
\[4]Hear, I beseech you, and I will speak: I will demand of you, and declare you to me.
\[5]I have heard of you by the hearing of the ear: but now my eye sees you.
\[6]Why I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.
\[7]And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends: for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.
\[8]Therefore take to you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that you have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.
\[9]So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.
\[10]And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
\[11]Then came there to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought on him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.
\[12]So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
\[13]He had also seven sons and three daughters.
\[14]And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.
\[15]And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brothers.
\[16]After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
\[17]So Job died, being old and full of days.

\[5]Hold up my goings in your paths, that my footsteps slip not.
\[6]I have called on you, for you will hear me, O God: incline your ear to me, and hear my speech.
\[7]Show your marvelous loving kindness, O you that save by your right hand them which put their trust in you from those that rise up against them.
\[8]Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of your wings,
\[9]From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.
\[10]They are enclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.
\[11]They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;
\[12]Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
\[13]Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is your sword:
\[14]From men which are your hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly you fill with your hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.

\[2]The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.
\[3]I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies.
\[4]The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.
\[5]The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.
\[6]In my distress I called on the LORD, and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.
\[7]Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
\[8]There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
\[9]He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.
\[10]And he rode on a cherub, and did fly: yes, he did fly on the wings of the wind.
\[11]He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.
\[12]At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.
\[13]The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.
\[14]Yes, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightning, and discomfited them.
\[15]Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
\[16]He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
\[17]He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.
\[18]They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.
\[19]He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
\[20]The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me.
\[21]For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
\[22]For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
\[23]I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.
\[24]Therefore has the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
\[25]With the merciful you will show yourself merciful; with an upright man you will show yourself upright;
\[26]With the pure you will show yourself pure; and with the fraudulent you will show yourself devious.
\[27]For you will save the afflicted people; but will bring down high looks.
\[28]For you will light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.
\[29]For by you I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.
\[30]As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.
\[31]For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?
\[32]It is God that girds me with strength, and makes my way perfect.
\[33]He makes my feet like hinds' feet, and sets me on my high places.
\[34]He teaches my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms.
\[35]You have also given me the shield of your salvation: and your right hand has held me up, and your gentleness has made me great.
\[36]You have enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
\[37]I have pursued my enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
\[38]I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.
\[39]For you have girded me with strength to the battle: you have subdued under me those that rose up against me.
\[40]You have also given me the necks of my enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.
\[41]They cried, but there was none to save them: even to the LORD, but he answered them not.
\[42]Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
\[43]You have delivered me from the strivings of the people; and you have made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.
\[44]As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves to me.
\[45]The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.
\[46]The LORD lives; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
\[47]It is God that avenges me, and subdues the people under me.
\[48]He delivers me from my enemies: yes, you lift me up above those that rise up against me: you have delivered me from the violent man.
\[49]Therefore will I give thanks to you, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises to your name.
\[50]Great deliverance gives he to his king; and shows mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for ever more.

\[10]For he sees that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.
\[11]Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.
\[12]Nevertheless man being in honor stays not: he is like the beasts that perish.
\[13]This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.
\[14]Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.
\[15]But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.
\[16]Be not you afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
\[17]For when he dies he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.
\[18]Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise you, when you do well to yourself.

ave me, O God; for the waters are come in to my soul.
\[2]I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
\[3]I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: my eyes fail while I wait for my God.
\[4]They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: they that would destroy me, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.
\[5]O God, you know my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from you.
\[6]Let not them that wait on you, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek you be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.
\[7]Because for your sake I have borne reproach; shame has covered my face.
\[8]I am become a stranger to my brothers, and an alien to my mother's children.
\[9]For the zeal of your house has eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached you are fallen on me.
\[10]When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.
\[11]I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.
\[12]They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.
\[13]But as for me, my prayer is to you, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of your mercy hear me, in the truth of your salvation.
\[14]Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
\[15]Let not the flood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth on me.
\[16]Hear me, O LORD; for your loving kindness is good: turn to me according to the multitude of your tender mercies.
\[17]And hide not your face from your servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.
\[18]Draw near to my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of my enemies.
\[19]You have known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor: my adversaries are all before you.
\[20]Reproach has broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.
\[21]They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
\[22]Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.
\[23]Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.
\[24]Pour out your indignation on them, and let your wrathful anger take hold of them.
\[25]Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.
\[26]For they persecute him whom you have smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom you have wounded.
\[27]Add iniquity to their iniquity: and let them not come into your righteousness.
\[28]Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.
\[29]But I am poor and sorrowful: let your salvation, O God, set me up on high.
\[30]I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
\[31]This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that has horns and hoofs.
\[32]The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.
\[33]For the LORD hears the poor, and despises not his prisoners.
\[34]Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moves therein.
\[35]For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.
\[36]The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.

\[4]For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.
\[5]They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.
\[6]Therefore pride compasses them about as a chain; violence covers them as a garment.

\[2]I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
\[3]Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
\[4]We will not hide them from their children, showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he has done.
\[5]For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
\[6]That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:
\[7]That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
\[8]And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
\[9]The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
\[10]They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
\[11]And forgot his works, and his wonders that he had showed them.
\[12]Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
\[13]He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
\[14]In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
\[15]He split the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.
\[16]He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
\[17]And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
\[18]And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
\[19]Yes, they spoke against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
\[20]Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
\[21]Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
\[22]Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
\[23]Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
\[24]And had rained down manna on them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
\[25]Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
\[26]He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
\[27]He rained flesh also on them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
\[28]And he let it fall in the middle of their camp, round about their habitations.
\[29]So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
\[30]They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,
\[31]The wrath of God came on them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
\[32]For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
\[33]Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
\[34]When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God.
\[35]And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
\[36]Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied to him with their tongues.
\[37]For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.
\[38]But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yes, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
\[39]For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passes away, and comes not again.
\[40]How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!
\[41]Yes, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
\[42]They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
\[43]How he had worked his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
\[44]And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
\[45]He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
\[46]He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.
\[47]He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
\[48]He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
\[49]He cast on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
\[50]He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
\[51]And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
\[52]But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
\[53]And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
\[54]And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
\[55]He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
\[56]Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
\[57]But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
\[58]For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
\[59]When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
\[60]So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
\[61]And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.
\[62]He gave his people over also to the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
\[63]The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
\[64]Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
\[65]Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouts by reason of wine.
\[66]And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
\[67]Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
\[68]But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
\[69]And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he has established for ever.
\[70]He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
\[71]From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
\[72]So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

\[21]He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
\[22]To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.
\[23]Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
\[24]And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.
\[25]He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtly with his servants.
\[26]He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.
\[27]They showed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.

\[34]He spoke, and the locusts came, and caterpillars, and that without number,
\[35]And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.
\[36]He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.
\[37]He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.
\[38]Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell on them.
\[39]He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.

\[3]Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that does righteousness at all times.
\[4]Remember me, O LORD, with the favor that you bore to your people: O visit me with your salvation;
\[5]That I may see the good of your chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance.
\[6]We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
\[7]Our fathers understood not your wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of your mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.
\[8]Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
\[9]He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
\[10]And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
\[11]And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
\[12]Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
\[13]They soon forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel:
\[14]But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
\[15]And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
\[16]They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.
\[17]The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.
\[18]And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
\[19]They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
\[20]Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eats grass.
\[21]They forgot God their savior, which had done great things in Egypt;
\[22]Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.
\[23]Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
\[24]Yes, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
\[25]But murmured in their tents, and listened not to the voice of the LORD.
\[26]Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
\[27]To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
\[28]They joined themselves also to Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
\[29]Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague broke in on them.
\[30]Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.
\[31]And that was counted to him for righteousness to all generations for ever more.
\[32]They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
\[33]Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips.
\[34]They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:
\[35]But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
\[36]And they served their idols: which were a snare to them.
\[37]Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils,
\[38]And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.
\[39]Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.
\[40]Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, so that he abhorred his own inheritance.
\[41]And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
\[42]Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
\[43]Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
\[44]Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
\[45]And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
\[46]He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.
\[47]Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks to your holy name, and to triumph in your praise.

\[26]They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.
\[27]They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end.
\[28]Then they cry to the LORD in their trouble, and he brings them out of their distresses.

\[30]Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he brings them to their desired haven.
\[31]Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
\[32]Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
\[33]He turns rivers into a wilderness, and the springs into dry ground;
\[34]A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
\[35]He turns the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into springs.
\[36]And there he makes the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;
\[37]And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
\[38]He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffers not their cattle to decrease.
\[39]Again, they are diminished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
\[40]He pours contempt on princes, and causes them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.
\[41]Yet sets he the poor on high from affliction, and makes him families like a flock.

\[14]Cast in your lot among us; let us all have one purse:

\[18]And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privately for their own lives.

\[21]She cries in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she utters her words, saying,
\[22]How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
\[23]Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit to you, I will make known my words to you.
\[24]Because I have called, and you refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
\[25]But you have set at nothing all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
\[26]I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear comes;
\[27]When your fear comes as desolation, and your destruction comes as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish comes on you.
\[28]Then shall they call on me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
\[29]For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
\[30]They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
\[31]Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
\[32]For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
\[33]But whoever listens to me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.

\[11]My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:
\[12]For whom the LORD loves he corrects; even as a father the son in whom he delights.
\[13]Happy is the man that finds wisdom, and the man that gets understanding.

\[22]So shall they be life to your soul, and grace to your neck.
\[23]Then shall you walk in your way safely, and your foot shall not stumble.
\[24]When you lie down, you shall not be afraid: yes, you shall lie down, and your sleep shall be sweet.

\[27]Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.
\[28]Say not to your neighbor, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when you have it by you.
\[29]Devise not evil against your neighbor, seeing he dwells securely by you.
\[30]Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done you no harm.
\[31]Envy you not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.
\[32]For the fraudulent is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.
\[33]The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesses the habitation of the just.

\[28]Can one go on hot coals, and his feet not be burned?

\[30]Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
\[31]But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
\[32]But whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding: he that does it destroys his own soul.
\[33]A wound and dishonor shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.

\[5]Will you set your eyes on that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.
\[6]Eat you not the bread of him that has an evil eye, neither desire you his dainty meats:
\[7]For as he thinks in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, said he to you; but his heart is not with you.
\[8]The morsel which you have eaten shall you vomit up, and lose your sweet words.
\[9]Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of your words.

\[21]For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.
\[22]Listen to your father that begat you, and despise not your mother when she is old.

\[4]And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.
\[5]A wise man is strong; yes, a man of knowledge increases strength.
\[6]For by wise counsel you shall make your war: and in multitude of counsellors there is safety.
\[7]Wisdom is too high for a fool: he opens not his mouth in the gate.

\[15]Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:

\[17]Rejoice not when your enemy falls, and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles:
\[18]Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.
\[19]Fret not yourself because of evil men, neither be you envious at the wicked:
\[20]For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.
\[21]My son, fear you the LORD and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change:
\[22]For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knows the ruin of them both?
\[23]These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.
\[24]He that said to the wicked, You are righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:
\[25]But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come on them.
\[26]Every man shall kiss his lips that gives a right answer.
\[27]Prepare your work without, and make it fit for yourself in the field; and afterwards build your house.
\[28]Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause; and deceive not with your lips.
\[29]Say not, I will do so to him as he has done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.
\[30]I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
\[31]And, see, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.
\[32]Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked on it, and received instruction.

hese are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
\[2]It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honor of kings is to search out a matter.
\[3]The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.
\[4]Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
\[5]Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.
\[6]Put not forth yourself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:
\[7]For better it is that it be said to you, Come up here; than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince whom your eyes have seen.
\[8]Go not forth hastily to strive, lest you know not what to do in the end thereof, when your neighbor has put you to shame.
\[9]Debate your cause with your neighbor himself; and discover not a secret to another:
\[10]Lest he that hears it put you to shame, and your infamy turn not away.
\[11]A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.
\[12]As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover on an obedient ear.
\[13]As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refreshes the soul of his masters.
\[14]Whoever boasts himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.
\[15]By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaks the bone.
\[16]Have you found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for you, lest you be filled therewith, and vomit it.
\[17]Withdraw your foot from your neighbor's house; lest he be weary of you, and so hate you.
\[18]A man that bears false witness against his neighbor is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
\[19]Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
\[20]As he that takes away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar on nitre, so is he that singes songs to an heavy heart.
\[21]If your enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
\[22]For you shall heap coals of fire on his head, and the LORD shall reward you.
\[23]The north wind drives away rain: so does an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.
\[24]It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.
\[25]As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.
\[26]A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.
\[27]It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.

\[4]Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest you also be like to him.
\[5]Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.
\[6]He that sends a message by the hand of a fool cuts off the feet, and drinks damage.
\[7]The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.
\[8]As he that binds a stone in a sling, so is he that gives honor to a fool.
\[9]As a thorn goes up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouths of fools.

\[11]As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool returns to his folly.
\[12]See you a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.
\[13]The slothful man said, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets.
\[14]As the door turns on his hinges, so does the slothful on his bed.
\[15]The slothful hides his hand in his bosom; it grieves him to bring it again to his mouth.
\[16]The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.
\[17]He that passes by, and meddles with strife belonging not to him, is like one that takes a dog by the ears.
\[18]As a mad man who casts firebrands, arrows, and death,
\[19]So is the man that deceives his neighbor, and said, Am not I in sport?
\[20]Where no wood is, there the fire goes out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceases.
\[21]As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife.
\[22]The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
\[23]Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.
\[24]He that hates dissembles with his lips, and lays up deceit within him;
\[25]When he speaks fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.
\[26]Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be showed before the whole congregation.
\[27]Whoever digs a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolls a stone, it will return on him.

\[16]Whoever hides her hides the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which denudes itself.
\[17]Iron sharpens iron; so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.
\[18]Whoever keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waits on his master shall be honored.
\[19]As in water face answers to face, so the heart of man to man.
\[20]Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
\[21]As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise.
\[22]Though you should bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.
\[23]Be you diligent to know the state of your flocks, and look well to your herds.
\[24]For riches are not for ever: and does the crown endure to every generation?
\[25]The hay appears, and the tender grass shows itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.

\[23]For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.

\[3]What profit has a man of all his labor which he takes under the sun?
\[4]One generation passes away, and another generation comes: but the earth stays for ever.
\[5]The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to his place where he arose.
\[6]The wind goes toward the south, and turns about to the north; it whirls about continually, and the wind returns again according to his circuits.
\[7]All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; to the place from where the rivers come, thither they return again.
\[8]All things are full of labor; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
\[9]The thing that has been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.
\[10]Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it has been already of old time, which was before us.
\[11]There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.
\[12]I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
\[13]And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail has God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.
\[14]I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

 said in my heart, Go to now, I will prove you with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.
\[2]I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What does it?
\[3]I sought in my heart to give myself to wine, yet acquainting my heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.
\[4]I made me great works; I built me houses; I planted me vineyards:
\[5]I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:
\[6]I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that brings forth trees:
\[7]I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:
\[8]I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I got me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
\[9]So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
\[10]And whatever my eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labor: and this was my portion of all my labor.
\[11]Then I looked on all the works that my hands had worked, and on the labor that I had labored to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.
\[12]And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that comes after the king? even that which has been already done.
\[13]Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.
\[14]The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walks in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happens to them all.
\[15]Then said I in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so it happens even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.
\[16]For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten.  And how dies the wise man? as the fool.
\[17]Therefore I hated life; because the work that is worked under the sun is grievous to me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.
\[18]Yes, I hated all my labor which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it to the man that shall be after me.
\[19]And who knows whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.
\[20]Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labor which I took under the sun.
\[21]For there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that has not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.
\[22]For what has man of all his labor, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he has labored under the sun?
\[23]For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yes, his heart takes not rest in the night. This is also vanity.
\[24]There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.
\[25]For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?
\[26]For God gives to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

\[2]A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
\[3]A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
\[4]A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
\[5]A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
\[6]A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
\[7]A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
\[8]A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
\[9]What profit has he that works in that wherein he labors?
\[10]I have seen the travail, which God has given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.
\[11]He has made every thing beautiful in his time: also he has set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God makes from the beginning to the end.
\[12]I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.
\[13]And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labor, it is the gift of God.
\[14]I know that, whatever God does, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God does it, that men should fear before him.
\[15]That which has been is now; and that which is to be has already been; and God requires that which is past.
\[16]And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.
\[17]I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.
\[18]I said in my heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
\[19]For that which befalls the sons of men befalls beasts; even one thing befalls them: as the one dies, so dies the other; yes, they have all one breath; so that a man has no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.
\[20]All go to one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
\[21]Who knows the spirit of man that goes upward, and the spirit of the beast that goes downward to the earth?
\[22]Why I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

\[3]Yes, better is he than both they, which has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
\[4]Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.

\[6]Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.

\[9]Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labor.
\[10]For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falls; for he has not another to help him up.
\[11]Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?
\[12]And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
\[13]Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.
\[14]For out of prison he comes to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becomes poor.
\[15]I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.

\[6]Suffer not your mouth to cause your flesh to sin; neither say you before the angel, that it was an error: why should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of your hands?
\[7]For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear you God.
\[8]If you see the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regards; and there be higher than they.

\[2]It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.
\[3]Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.
\[4]The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
\[5]It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.
\[6]For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.

\[9]Be not hasty in your spirit to be angry: for anger rests in the bosom of fools.
\[10]Say not you, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for you do not inquire wisely concerning this.
\[11]Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.
\[12]For wisdom is a defense, and money is a defense: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom gives life to them that have it.
\[13]Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?
\[14]In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also has set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.
\[15]All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongs his life in his wickedness.
\[16]Be not righteous over much; neither make yourself over wise: why should you destroy yourself ?
\[17]Be not over much wicked, neither be you foolish: why should you die before your time?
\[18]It is good that you should take hold of this; yes, also from this withdraw not your hand: for he that fears God shall come forth of them all.
\[19]Wisdom strengthens the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.
\[20]For there is not a just man on earth, that does good, and sins not.
\[21]Also take no heed to all words that are spoken; lest you hear your servant curse you:
\[22]For oftentimes also your own heart knows that you yourself likewise have cursed others.
\[23]All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.

\[3]Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he does whatever pleases him.
\[4]Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say to him, What do you?
\[5]Whoever keeps the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerns both time and judgment.
\[6]Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great on him.
\[7]For he knows not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?
\[8]There is no man that has power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither has he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.
\[9]All this have I seen, and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man rules over another to his own hurt.
\[10]And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.
\[11]Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
\[12]Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:
\[13]But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he fears not before God.
\[14]There is a vanity which is done on the earth; that there be just men, to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.
\[15]Then I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labor the days of his life, which God gives him under the sun.

\[3]This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event to all: yes, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.
\[4]For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
\[5]For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.
\[6]Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.

\[12]For man also knows not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly on them.
\[13]This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great to me:
\[14]There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:
\[15]Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.
\[16]Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.

he vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
\[2]Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.
\[3]The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel does not know, my people does not consider.
\[4]Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger, they are gone away backward.
\[5]Why should you be stricken any more? you will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
\[6]From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.
\[7]Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
\[8]And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
\[9]Except the LORD of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrah.
\[10]Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.
\[11]To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.
\[12]When you come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, to tread my courts?
\[13]Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
\[14]Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates: they are a trouble to me; I am weary to bear them.
\[15]And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you: yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
\[16]Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;
\[17]Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
\[18]Come now, and let us reason together, said the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
\[19]If you be willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land:
\[20]But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it.
\[21]How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.
\[22]Your silver is become dross, your wine mixed with water:
\[23]Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loves gifts, and follows after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come to them.
\[24]Therefore said the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies:
\[25]And I will turn my hand on you, and purely purge away your dross, and take away all your tin:
\[26]And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counsellors as at the beginning: afterward you shall be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.
\[27]Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.
\[28]And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.
\[29]For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.
\[30]For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.
\[31]And the strong shall be as wick, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.

\[2]And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.
\[3]And many people shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
\[4]And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
\[5]O house of Jacob, come you, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.
\[6]Therefore you have forsaken your people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.

\[8]Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:
\[9]And the mean man bows down, and the great man humbles himself: therefore forgive them not.
\[10]Enter into the rock, and hide you in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.
\[11]The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
\[12]For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be on every one that is proud and lofty, and on every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:
\[13]And on all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and on all the oaks of Bashan,
\[14]And on all the high mountains, and on all the hills that are lifted up,

\[17]And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
\[18]And the idols he shall utterly abolish.
\[19]And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he rises to shake terribly the earth.
\[20]In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
\[21]To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he rises to shake terribly the earth.

ow will I sing to my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My well beloved has a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:
\[2]And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the middle of it, and also made a wine press therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
\[3]And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.
\[4]What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? why, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?
\[5]And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:
\[6]And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor dig; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.
\[7]For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.
\[8]Woe to them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the middle of the earth!
\[9]In my ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.
\[10]Yes, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.
\[11]Woe to them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!
\[12]And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.
\[13]Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.
\[14]Therefore hell has enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoices, shall descend into it.
\[15]And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:
\[16]But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.
\[17]Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
\[18]Woe to them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:
\[19]That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!
\[20]Woe to them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
\[21]Woe to them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!
\[22]Woe to them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:
\[23]Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
\[24]Therefore as the fire devours the stubble, and the flame consumes the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
\[25]Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them, and has smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses were torn in the middle of the streets.  For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
\[26]And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss to them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:
\[27]None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the lace of their shoes be broken:

n the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.
\[2]Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.
\[3]And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.
\[4]And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
\[5]Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the middle of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.
\[6]Then flew one of the seraphim to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
\[7]And he laid it on my mouth, and said, See, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.
\[8]Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.
\[9]And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you indeed, but understand not; and see you indeed, but perceive not.
\[10]Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.
\[11]Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,
\[12]And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the middle of the land.
\[13]But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.

nd it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
\[2]And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.
\[3]Then said the LORD to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;
\[4]And say to him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
\[5]Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against you, saying,
\[6]Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the middle of it, even the son of Tabeal:
\[7]Thus said the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
\[8]For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within three score and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.
\[9]And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.
\[10]Moreover the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,
\[11]Ask you a sign of the LORD your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.
\[12]But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.
\[13]And he said, Hear you now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also?
\[14]Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
\[15]Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
\[16]For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that you abhor shall be forsaken of both her kings.
\[17]The LORD shall bring on you, and on your people, and on your father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.
\[18]And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
\[19]And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and on all thorns, and on all bushes.
\[20]In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.
\[21]And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;
\[22]And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.
\[23]And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand sliver coins, it shall even be for briers and thorns.
\[24]With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.
\[25]And on all hills that shall be dig with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.

\[3]And I went to the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son.  Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.
\[4]For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.

\[7]Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up on them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:
\[8]And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.
\[9]Associate yourselves, O you people, and you shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all you of far countries: gird yourselves, and you shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and you shall be broken in pieces.
\[10]Take counsel together, and it shall come to nothing; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.
\[11]For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,
\[12]Say you not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear you their fear, nor be afraid.
\[13]Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.
\[14]And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[15]And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.
\[16]Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
\[17]And I will wait on the LORD, that hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.
\[18]Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwells in mount Zion.
\[19]And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that have familiar spirits, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead?

\[21]And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.

\[2]The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, on them has the light shined.

\[14]Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.

\[16]For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.

\[12]Why it shall come to pass, that when the Lord has performed his whole work on mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.

\[14]And my hand has found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathers eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.

\[17]And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;
\[18]And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standard-bearer faints.
\[19]And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.
\[20]And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay on him that smote them; but shall stay on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
\[21]The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.

\[4]Let my outcasts dwell with you, Moab; be you a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortionist is at an end, the spoiler ceases, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.

\[12]And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.

\[2]Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.
\[3]The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet:
\[4]And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which when he that looks on it sees, while it is yet in his hand he eats it up.
\[5]In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, to the residue of his people,
\[6]And for a spirit of judgment to him that sits in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.
\[7]But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.
\[8]For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.
\[9]Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.
\[10]For precept must be on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, and there a little:
\[11]For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.
\[12]To whom he said, This is the rest with which you may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.
\[13]But the word of the LORD was to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
\[14]Why hear the word of the LORD, you scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem.
\[15]Because you have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing whip shall pass through, it shall not come to us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:
\[16]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.
\[17]Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.
\[18]And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing whip shall pass through, then you shall be trodden down by it.
\[19]From the time that it goes forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.
\[20]For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.
\[21]For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.
\[22]Now therefore be you not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined on the whole earth.
\[23]Give you ear, and hear my voice; listen, and hear my speech.
\[24]Does the plowman plow all day to sow? does he open and break the clods of his ground?
\[25]When he has made plain the face thereof, does he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rye in their place?
\[26]For his God does instruct him to discretion, and does teach him.
\[27]For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about on the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.
\[28]Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen.
\[29]This also comes forth from the LORD of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.

\[3]And I will camp against you round about, and will lay siege against you with a mount, and I will raise forts against you.
\[4]And you shall be brought down, and shall speak out of the ground, and your speech shall be low out of the dust, and your voice shall be, as of one that has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.
\[5]Moreover the multitude of your strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passes away: yes, it shall be at an instant suddenly.
\[6]You shall be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.
\[7]And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her fortification, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.
\[8]It shall even be as when an hungry man dreams, and, behold, he eats; but he wakes, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreams, and, behold, he drinks; but he wakes, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul has appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.
\[9]Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry you out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.
\[10]For the LORD has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers has he covered.
\[11]And the vision of all is become to you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray you: and he said, I cannot; for it is sealed:
\[12]And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray you: and he said, I am not learned.
\[13]Why the Lord said, For as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:
\[14]Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.
\[15]Woe to them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who sees us? and who knows us?
\[16]Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?
\[17]Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?
\[18]And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.
\[19]The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
\[20]For the terrible one is brought to nothing, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:
\[21]That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproves in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nothing.
\[22]Therefore thus said the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.
\[23]But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the middle of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.
\[24]They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.

\[3]Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.

\[7]For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.
\[8]Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:

\[10]Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not to us right things, speak to us smooth things, prophesy deceits:
\[11]Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.
\[12]Why thus said the Holy One of Israel, Because you despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:
\[13]Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly at an instant.
\[14]And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a shard to take fire from the hearth, or to take water with out of the pit.
\[15]For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall you be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and you would not.
\[16]But you said, No; for we will flee on horses; therefore shall you flee: and, We will ride on the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
\[17]One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall you flee: till you be left as a beacon on the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.
\[18]And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious to you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy on you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.
\[19]For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: you shall weep no more: he will be very gracious to you at the voice of your cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer you.
\[20]And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not your teachers be removed into a corner any more, but your eyes shall see your teachers:
\[21]And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, This is the way, walk you in it, when you turn to the right hand, and when you turn to the left.
\[22]You shall defile also the covering of your graven images of silver, and the ornament of your molten images of gold: you shall cast them away as a menstruous cloth; you shall say to it, Get you hence.
\[23]Then shall he give the rain of your seed, that you shall sow the ground with; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall your cattle feed in large pastures.
\[24]The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.
\[25]And there shall be on every high mountain, and on every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
\[26]Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD binds up the breach of his people, and heals the stroke of their wound.
\[27]Behold, the name of the LORD comes from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:
\[28]And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the middle of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.
\[29]You shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.
\[30]And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall show the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.
\[31]For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod.
\[32]And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay on him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.

\[2]And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.
\[3]Then came forth to him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.
\[4]And Rabshakeh said to them, Say you now to Hezekiah, Thus said the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein you trust?
\[5]I say, say you, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?
\[6]See, you trust in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; where on if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.
\[7]But if you say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar?
\[8]Now therefore give pledges, I pray you, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you be able on your part to set riders on them.
\[9]How then will you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
\[10]And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
\[11]Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray you, to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
\[12]But Rabshakeh said, Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? has he not sent me to the men that sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own urine with you?
\[13]Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear you the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
\[14]Thus said the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.
\[15]Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[16]Listen not to Hezekiah: for thus said the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat you every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink you every one the waters of his own cistern;
\[17]Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
\[18]Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD will deliver us.  Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\[19]Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
\[20]Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
\[21]But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
\[22]Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

\[2]And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
\[3]And they said to him, Thus said Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
\[4]It may be the LORD your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD your God has heard: why lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.

\[7]Behold, I will send a blast on him, and he shall hear a rumor, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
\[8]So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
\[9]And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with you. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
\[10]Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not your God, in whom you trust, deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[11]Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shall you be delivered?
\[12]Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?
\[13]Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?
\[14]And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
\[15]And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD, saying,
\[16]O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwell between the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: you have made heaven and earth.
\[17]Incline your ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which has sent to reproach the living God.
\[18]Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,
\[19]And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
\[20]Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are the LORD, even you only.
\[21]Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Whereas you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:
\[22]This is the word which the LORD has spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, has despised you, and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.
\[23]Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? and against whom have you exalted your voice, and lifted up your eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.
\[24]By your servants have you reproached the Lord, and have said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.
\[25]I have dig, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.
\[26]Have you not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that you should be to lay waste defended cities into ruinous heaps.
\[27]Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.
\[28]But I know your stayed, and your going out, and your coming in, and your rage against me.
\[29]Because your rage against me, and your tumult, is come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.
\[30]And this shall be a sign to you, You shall eat this year such as grows of itself; and the second year that which springs of the same: and in the third year sow you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
\[31]And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:
\[32]For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.
\[33]Therefore thus said the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.
\[34]By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, said the LORD.
\[35]For I will defend this city to save it for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\[36]Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.
\[37]So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelled at Nineveh.
\[38]And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

n those days was Hezekiah sick to death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus said the LORD, Set your house in order: for you shall die, and not live.
\[2]Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the LORD,
\[3]And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
\[4]Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,
\[5]Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus said the LORD, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: behold, I will add to your days fifteen years.
\[6]And I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.
\[7]And this shall be a sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he has spoken;
\[8]Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.
\[9]The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:
\[10]I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.
\[11]I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
\[12]My age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night will you make an end of me.
\[13]I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night will you make an end of me.
\[14]Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: my eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.
\[15]What shall I say? he has both spoken to me, and himself has done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
\[16]O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so will you recover me, and make me to live.
\[17]Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but you have in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for you have cast all my sins behind your back.
\[18]For the grave cannot praise you, death can not celebrate you: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for your truth.
\[19]The living, the living, he shall praise you, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known your truth.
\[20]The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.
\[21]For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaster on the boil, and he shall recover.
\[22]Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?

t that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.
\[2]And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.
\[3]Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from where came they to you? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country to me, even from Babylon.
\[4]Then said he, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.
\[5]Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:
\[6]Behold, the days come, that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, said the LORD.
\[7]And of your sons that shall issue from you, which you shall beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
\[8]Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which you have spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.

\[2]Speak you comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry to her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she has received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.
\[3]The voice of him that cries in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
\[4]Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:
\[5]And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it.
\[6]The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:
\[7]The grass wither, the flower fades: because the spirit of the LORD blows on it: surely the people is grass.
\[8]The grass wither, the flower fades: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.
\[9]O Zion, that bring good tidings, get you up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bring good tidings, lift up your voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say to the cities of Judah, Behold your God!
\[10]Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.
\[11]He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.
\[12]Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
\[13]Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counselor has taught him?
\[14]With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?
\[15]Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he takes up the isles as a very little thing.
\[16]And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.
\[17]All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.
\[18]To whom then will you liken God? or what likeness will you compare to him?
\[19]The workman melts a graven image, and the goldsmith spreads it over with gold, and casts silver chains.
\[20]He that is so impoverished that he has no oblation chooses a tree that will not rot; he seeks to him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.
\[21]Have you not known? have you not heard? has it not been told you from the beginning? have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?
\[22]It is he that sits on the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in:
\[23]That brings the princes to nothing; he makes the judges of the earth as vanity.
\[24]Yes, they shall not be planted; yes, they shall not be sown: yes, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow on them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.
\[25]To whom then will you liken me, or shall I be equal? said the Holy One.
\[26]Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these things, that brings out their host by number: he calls them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one fails.
\[27]Why say you, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?
\[28]Have you not known? have you not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, faints not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.
\[29]He gives power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increases strength.
\[30]Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:
\[31]But they that wait on the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.

\[2]Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow.
\[3]He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he had not gone with his feet.
\[4]Who has worked and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.
\[5]The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.
\[6]They helped every one his neighbor; and every one said to his brother, Be of good courage.
\[7]So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smoothes with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the soldering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.
\[8]But you, Israel, are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.
\[9]You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called you from the chief men thereof, and said to you, You are my servant; I have chosen you, and not cast you away.
\[10]Fear you not; for I am with you: be not dismayed; for I am your God: I will strengthen you; yes, I will help you; yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.
\[11]Behold, all they that were incensed against you shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with you shall perish.
\[12]You shall seek them, and shall not find them, even them that contended with you: they that war against you shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nothing.
\[13]For I the LORD your God will hold your right hand, saying to you, Fear not; I will help you.
\[14]Fear not, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel; I will help you, said the LORD, and your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
\[15]Behold, I will make you a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make the hills as chaff.
\[16]You shall fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and you shall rejoice in the LORD, and shall glory in the Holy One of Israel.
\[17]When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue fails for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.
\[18]I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the middle of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.
\[19]I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together:
\[20]That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created it.
\[21]Produce your cause, said the LORD; bring forth your strong reasons, said the King of Jacob.
\[22]Let them bring them forth, and show us what shall happen: let them show the former things, what they be, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.
\[23]Show the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods: yes, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.
\[24]Behold, you are of nothing, and your work of nothing: an abomination is he that chooses you.
\[25]I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call on my name: and he shall come on princes as on mortar, and as the potter treads clay.
\[26]Who has declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yes, there is none that shows, yes, there is none that declares, yes, there is none that hears your words.
\[27]The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to Jerusalem one that brings good tidings.
\[28]For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there was no counselor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.

\[4]He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.
\[5]Thus said God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which comes out of it; he that gives breath to the people on it, and spirit to them that walk therein:
\[6]I the LORD have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand, and will keep you, and give you for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;
\[7]To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.
\[8]I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.
\[9]Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.
\[10]Sing to the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, you that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.
\[11]Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar does inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.
\[12]Let them give glory to the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.
\[13]The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yes, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.
\[14]I have long time held my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.
\[15]I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.
\[16]And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do to them, and not forsake them.
\[17]They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, You are our gods.
\[18]Hear, you deaf; and look, you blind, that you may see.
\[19]Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent?  who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD's servant?
\[20]Seeing many things, but you observe not; opening the ears, but he hears not.
\[21]The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honorable.
\[22]But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivers; for a spoil, and none said, Restore.
\[23]Who among you will give ear to this? who will listen and hear for the time to come?
\[24]Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient to his law.
\[25]Therefore he has poured on him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it has set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.

\[11]I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no savior.
\[12]I have declared, and have saved, and I have showed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore you are my witnesses, said the LORD, that I am God.
\[13]Yes, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?

\[18]Remember you not the former things, neither consider the things of old.

\[22]But you have not called on me, O Jacob; but you have been weary of me, O Israel.

\[24]Thus said the LORD, your redeemer, and he that formed you from the womb, I am the LORD that makes all things; that stretches forth the heavens alone; that spreads abroad the earth by myself;
\[25]That frustrates the tokens of the liars, and makes diviners mad; that turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;
\[26]That confirms the word of his servant, and performes the counsel of his messengers; that said to Jerusalem, You shall be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, You shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:
\[27]That said to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up your rivers:
\[28]That said of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.

hus said the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;
\[2]I will go before you, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:
\[3]And I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that I, the LORD, which call you by your name, am the God of Israel.
\[4]For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel my elect, I have even called you by your name: I have surnamed you, though you have not known me.
\[5]I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded you, though you have not known me:
\[6]That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.
\[7]I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.
\[8]Drop down, you heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it.
\[9]Woe to him that strives with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashions it, What make you? or your work, He has no hands?
\[10]Woe to him that said to his father, What beget you? or to the woman, What have you brought forth?
\[11]Thus said the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command you me.
\[12]I have made the earth, and created man on it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.
\[13]I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, said the LORD of hosts.
\[14]Thus said the LORD, The labor of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to you, and they shall be yours: they shall come after you; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down to you, they shall make supplication to you, saying, Surely God is in you; and there is none else, there is no God.
\[15]Truly you are a God that hide yourself, O God of Israel, the Savior.
\[16]They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.
\[17]But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting salvation: you shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.
\[18]For thus said the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he has established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.
\[19]I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not to the seed of Jacob, Seek you me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.
\[20]Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, you that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray to a god that cannot save.
\[21]Tell you, and bring them near; yes, let them take counsel together: who has declared this from ancient time? who has told it from that time?  have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Savior; there is none beside me.
\[22]Look to me, and be you saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.
\[23]I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.
\[24]Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.
\[25]In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.

\[3]Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb:

\[2]For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves on the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.
\[3]I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.
\[4]Because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew, and your brow brass;
\[5]I have even from the beginning declared it to you; before it came to pass I showed it you: lest you should say, My idol has done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, has commanded them.
\[6]You have heard, see all this; and will not you declare it? I have showed you new things from this time, even hidden things, and you did not know them.
\[7]They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when you heard them not; lest you should say, Behold, I knew them.
\[8]Yes, you heard not; yes, you knew not; yes, from that time that your ear was not opened: for I knew that you would deal very treacherously, and were called a transgressor from the womb.
\[9]For my name's sake will I defer my anger, and for my praise will I refrain for you, that I cut you not off.
\[10]Behold, I have refined you, but not with silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.
\[11]For my own sake, even for my own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory to another.
\[12]Listen to me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.
\[13]My hand also has laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand has spanned the heavens: when I call to them, they stand up together.
\[14]All you, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them has declared these things? The LORD has loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.
\[15]I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.
\[16]Come you near to me, hear you this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, has sent me.
\[17]Thus said the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD your God which teaches you to profit, which leads you by the way that you should go.
\[18]O that you had listened to my commandments! then had your peace been as a river, and your righteousness as the waves of the sea:
\[19]Your seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of your bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.
\[20]Go you forth of Babylon, flee you from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare you, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say you, The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob.
\[21]And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he split the rock also, and the waters gushed out.

isten, O isles, to me; and listen, you people, from far; The LORD has called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother has he made mention of my name.
\[2]And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand has he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver has he hid me;
\[3]And said to me, You are my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.
\[4]Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God.
\[5]And now, said the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.
\[6]And he said, It is a light thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the Gentiles, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.
\[7]Thus said the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose you.
\[8]Thus said the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard you, and in a day of salvation have I helped you: and I will preserve you, and give you for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;
\[9]That you may say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.
\[10]They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that has mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.
\[11]And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.
\[12]Behold, these shall come from far: and, see, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.
\[13]Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD has comforted his people, and will have mercy on his afflicted.
\[14]But Zion said, The LORD has forsaken me, and my Lord has forgotten me.
\[15]Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yes, they may forget, yet will I not forget you.
\[16]Behold, I have graven you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me.
\[17]Your children shall make haste; your destroyers and they that made you waste shall go forth of you.
\[18]Lift up your eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to you. As I live, said the LORD, you shall surely clothe you with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on you, as a bride does.
\[19]For your waste and your desolate places, and the land of your destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed you up shall be far away.
\[20]The children which you shall have, after you have lost the other, shall say again in your ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.
\[21]Then shall you say in your heart, Who has begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?
\[22]Thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring your sons in their arms, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.
\[23]And kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers: they shall bow down to you with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of your feet; and you shall know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.
\[24]Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?
\[25]But thus said the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contends with you, and I will save your children.
\[26]And I will feed them that oppress you with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am your Savior and your Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

\[13]And forget the LORD your maker, that has stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and have feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?

\[2]Why do you spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which satisfies not? listen diligently to me, and eat you that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.
\[3]Incline your ear, and come to me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.

\[7]Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return to the LORD, and he will have mercy on him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
\[8]For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, said the LORD.
\[9]For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
\[10]For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and returns not thither, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:
\[11]So shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth: it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
\[12]For you shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.

\[3]Neither let the son of the stranger, that has joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD has utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.
\[4]For thus said the LORD to the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;
\[5]Even to them will I give in my house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.

\[9]All you beasts of the field, come to devour, yes, all you beasts in the forest.
\[10]His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.
\[11]Yes, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.

\[11]And of whom have you been afraid or feared, that you have lied, and have not remembered me, nor laid it to your heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and you fear me not?

\[14]And shall say, Cast you up, cast you up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling block out of the way of my people.
\[15]For thus said the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
\[16]For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.

ehold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:
\[2]But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.
\[3]For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue has muttered perverseness.
\[4]None calls for justice, nor any pleads for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.
\[5]They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eats of their eggs dies, and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.
\[6]Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.
\[7]Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths.
\[8]The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whoever goes therein shall not know peace.
\[9]Therefore is judgment far from us, neither does justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.
\[10]We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.
\[11]We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.
\[12]For our transgressions are multiplied before you, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;
\[13]In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
\[14]And judgment is turned away backward, and justice stands afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.
\[15]Yes, truth fails; and he that departs from evil makes himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.
\[16]And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation to him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.
\[17]For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation on his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.
\[18]According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense.
\[19]So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.
\[20]And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob, said the LORD.
\[21]As for me, this is my covenant with them, said the LORD; My spirit that is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed's seed, said the LORD, from now on and for ever.

\[18]Violence shall no more be heard in your land, wasting nor destruction within your borders; but you shall call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.
\[19]The sun shall be no more your light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light to you: but the LORD shall be to you an everlasting light, and your God your glory.
\[20]Your sun shall no more go down; neither shall your moon withdraw itself: for the LORD shall be your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning shall be ended.

\[4]I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears on them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did evil before my eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.
\[5]Hear the word of the LORD, you that tremble at his word; Your brothers that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.
\[6]A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that renders recompense to his enemies.
\[7]Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.
\[8]Who has heard such a thing? who has seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once?  for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.
\[9]Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? said the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? said your God.
\[10]Rejoice you with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you that mourn for her:
\[11]That you may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that you may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.
\[12]For thus said the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall you suck, you shall be borne on her sides, and be dandled on her knees.
\[13]As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you; and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
\[14]And when you see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.
\[15]For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
\[16]For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.
\[17]They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the middle, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, said the LORD.
\[18]For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.
\[19]And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
\[20]And they shall bring all your brothers for an offering to the LORD out of all nations on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, said the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.
\[21]And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, said the LORD.
\[22]For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, said the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.
\[23]And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, said the LORD.
\[24]And they shall go forth, and look on the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh.

he words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
\[2]To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
\[3]It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
\[4]Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[5]Before I formed you in the belly I knew you; and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you, and I ordained you a prophet to the nations.
\[6]Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.
\[7]But the LORD said to me, Say not, I am a child: for you shall go to all that I shall send you, and whatever I command you you shall speak.
\[8]Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with you to deliver you, said the LORD.
\[9]Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said to me, Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.
\[10]See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.
\[11]Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what see you? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.
\[12]Then said the LORD to me, You have well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.
\[13]And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying, What see you? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the north.
\[14]Then the LORD said to me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth on all the inhabitants of the land.
\[15]For, see, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, said the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.
\[16]And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.
\[17]You therefore gird up your loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command you: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound you before them.
\[18]For, behold, I have made you this day a defended city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.
\[19]And they shall fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you; for I am with you, said the LORD, to deliver you.

oreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[2]Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus said the LORD; I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your espousals, when you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.
\[3]Israel was holiness to the LORD, and the first fruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come on them, said the LORD.
\[4]Hear you the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:
\[5]Thus said the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?
\[6]Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelled?
\[7]And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when you entered, you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.
\[8]The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.
\[9]Why I will yet plead with you, said the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.
\[10]For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.
\[11]Has a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.
\[12]Be astonished, O you heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be you very desolate, said the LORD.
\[13]For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
\[14]Is Israel a servant? is he a home born slave? why is he spoiled?
\[15]The young lions roared on him, and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.
\[16]Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of your head.
\[17]Have you not procured this to yourself, in that you have forsaken the LORD your God, when he led you by the way?
\[18]And now what have you to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what have you to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?
\[19]Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backslidings shall reprove you: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that you have forsaken the LORD your God, and that my fear is not in you, said the Lord GOD of hosts.
\[20]For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bands; and you said, I will not transgress; when on every high hill and under every green tree you wander, playing the harlot.
\[21]Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to me?
\[22]For though you wash you with nitre, and take you much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before me, said the Lord GOD.
\[23]How can you say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim?  see your way in the valley, know what you have done: you are a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
\[24]A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.
\[25]Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst: but you said, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.
\[26]As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets.
\[27]Saying to a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned their back to me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.
\[28]But where are your gods that you have made you? let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.
\[29]Why will you plead with me? you all have transgressed against me, said the LORD.
\[30]In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
\[31]O generation, see you the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel? a land of darkness? why say my people, We are lords; we will come no more to you?
\[32]Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
\[33]Why trim you your way to seek love? therefore have you also taught the wicked ones your ways.
\[34]Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but on all these.
\[35]Yet you say, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with you, because you say, I have not sinned.
\[36]Why gad you about so much to change your way? you also shall be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assyria.
\[37]Yes, you shall go forth from him, and your hands on your head: for the LORD has rejected your confidences, and you shall not prosper in them.

hey say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return to her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but you have played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, said the LORD.
\[2]Lift up your eyes to the high places, and see where you have not been lien with. In the ways have you sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land with your prostitutions and with your wickedness.
\[3]Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and you had a whore's forehead, you refused to be ashamed.
\[4]Will you not from this time cry to me, My father, you are the guide of my youth?
\[5]Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end?  Behold, you have spoken and done evil things as you could.
\[6]The LORD said also to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? she is gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the harlot.
\[7]And I said after she had done all these things, Turn you to me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
\[8]And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.
\[9]And it came to pass through the lightness of her prostitution, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.
\[10]And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not turned to me with her whole heart, but feignedly, said the LORD.
\[11]And the LORD said to me, The backsliding Israel has justified herself more than treacherous Judah.
\[12]Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, said the LORD; and I will not cause my anger to fall on you: for I am merciful, said the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.
\[13]Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against the LORD your God, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed my voice, said the LORD.
\[14]Turn, O backsliding children, said the LORD; for I am married to you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:
\[15]And I will give you pastors according to my heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
\[16]And it shall come to pass, when you be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, said the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.
\[17]At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.
\[18]In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance to your fathers.
\[19]But I said, How shall I put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, You shall call me, My father; and shall not turn away from me.
\[20]Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so have you dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, said the LORD.
\[21]A voice was heard on the high places, weeping and supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the LORD their God.
\[22]Return, you backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.  Behold, we come to you; for you are the LORD our God.
\[23]Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel.
\[24]For shame has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
\[25]We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covers us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.

f you will return, O Israel, said the LORD, return to me: and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight, then shall you not remove.
\[2]And you shall swear, The LORD lives, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.
\[3]For thus said the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.
\[4]Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
\[5]Declare you in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow you the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defended cities.
\[6]Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.
\[7]The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make your land desolate; and your cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.
\[8]For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.
\[9]And it shall come to pass at that day, said the LORD, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.
\[10]Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, You shall have peace; whereas the sword reaches to the soul.
\[11]At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,
\[12]Even a full wind from those places shall come to me: now also will I give sentence against them.
\[13]Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! for we are spoiled.
\[14]O Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long shall your vain thoughts lodge within you?
\[15]For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes affliction from mount Ephraim.
\[16]Make you mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.
\[17]As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she has been rebellious against me, said the LORD.
\[18]Your way and your doings have procured these things to you; this is your wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reaches to your heart.
\[19]My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart makes a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.
\[20]Destruction on destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.
\[21]How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?
\[22]For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are silly children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
\[23]I beheld the earth, and, see, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.
\[24]I beheld the mountains, and, see, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.
\[25]I beheld, and, see, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.
\[26]I beheld, and, see, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.
\[27]For thus has the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.
\[28]For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.
\[29]The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up on the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.
\[30]And when you are spoiled, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with crimson, though you deck you with ornaments of gold, though you rend your face with painting, in vain shall you make yourself fair; your lovers will despise you, they will seek your life.
\[31]For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that mourns herself, that spreads her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.

un you to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if you can find a man, if there be any that executes judgment, that seeks the truth; and I will pardon it.
\[2]And though they say, The LORD lives; surely they swear falsely.
\[3]O LORD, are not your eyes on the truth? you have stricken them, but they have not grieved; you have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.
\[4]Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, nor the judgment of their God.
\[5]I will get me to the great men, and will speak to them; for they have known the way of the LORD, and the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.
\[6]Why a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goes out there shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.
\[7]How shall I pardon you for this? your children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.
\[8]They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbor's wife.
\[9]Shall I not visit for these things? said the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\[10]Go you up on her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they are not the LORD's.
\[11]For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, said the LORD.
\[12]They have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come on us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:
\[13]And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done to them.
\[14]Why thus said the LORD God of hosts, Because you speak this word, behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
\[15]See, I will bring a nation on you from far, O house of Israel, said the LORD: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you know not, neither understand what they say.
\[16]Their quiver is as an open sepulcher, they are all mighty men.
\[17]And they shall eat up your harvest, and your bread, which your sons and your daughters should eat: they shall eat up your flocks and your herds: they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees: they shall impoverish your fenced cities, wherein you trusted, with the sword.
\[18]Nevertheless in those days, said the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.
\[19]And it shall come to pass, when you shall say, Why does the LORD our God all these things to us? then shall you answer them, Like as you have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall you serve strangers in a land that is not your's.
\[20]Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,
\[21]Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:
\[22]Fear you not me? said the LORD: will you not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?
\[23]But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.
\[24]Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that gives rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
\[25]Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld good things from you.
\[26]For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he that sets snares; they set a trap, they catch men.
\[27]As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.
\[28]They are waxen fat, they shine: yes, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.
\[29]Shall I not visit for these things? said the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\[30]A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;
\[31]The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will you do in the end thereof?

 you children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the middle of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appears out of the north, and great destruction.
\[2]I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.
\[3]The shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.
\[4]Prepare you war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! for the day goes away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.
\[5]Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
\[6]For thus has the LORD of hosts said, Hew you down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the middle of her.
\[7]As a fountain casts out her waters, so she casts out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds.
\[8]Be you instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from you; lest I make you desolate, a land not inhabited.
\[9]Thus said the LORD of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back your hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets.
\[10]To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot listen: behold, the word of the LORD is to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.
\[11]Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out on the children abroad, and on the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.
\[12]And their houses shall be turned to others, with their fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land, said the LORD.
\[13]For from the least of them even to the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely.
\[14]They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
\[15]Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? no, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, said the LORD.
\[16]Thus said the LORD, Stand you in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and you shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.
\[17]Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Listen to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not listen.
\[18]Therefore hear, you nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.
\[19]Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.
\[20]To what purpose comes there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.
\[21]Therefore thus said the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall on them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.
\[22]Thus said the LORD, Behold, a people comes from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.
\[23]They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea; and they ride on horses, set in array as men for war against you, O daughter of Zion.
\[24]We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.
\[25]Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side.
\[26]O daughter of my people, gird you with sackcloth, and wallow yourself in ashes: make you mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come on us.
\[27]I have set you for a tower and a fortress among my people, that you may know and try their way.
\[28]They are all grievous rebels, walking with slanders: they are brass and iron; they are all corrupters.
\[29]The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melts in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.

he word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
\[2]Stand in the gate of the LORD's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD.
\[3]Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
\[4]Trust you not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these.
\[5]For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if you thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor;
\[6]If you oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:
\[7]Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.
\[8]Behold, you trust in lying words, that cannot profit.
\[9]Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods whom you know not;
\[10]And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?
\[11]Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, said the LORD.
\[12]But go you now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.
\[13]And now, because you have done all these works, said the LORD, and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you heard not; and I called you, but you answered not;
\[14]Therefore will I do to this house, which is called by my name, wherein you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.
\[15]And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, even the whole seed of Ephraim.
\[16]Therefore pray not you for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear you.
\[17]See you not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\[18]The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.
\[19]Do they provoke me to anger? said the LORD: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?
\[20]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, my anger and my fury shall be poured out on this place, on man, and on beast, and on the trees of the field, and on the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
\[21]Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat flesh.
\[22]For I spoke not to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:
\[23]But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people: and walk you in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well to you.
\[24]But they listened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.
\[25]Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day I have even sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:
\[26]Yet they listened not to me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.
\[27]Therefore you shall speak all these words to them; but they will not listen to you: you shall also call to them; but they will not answer you.
\[28]But you shall say to them, This is a nation that obeys not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receives correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
\[29]Cut off your hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.
\[30]For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, said the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.
\[31]And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.
\[32]Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.
\[33]And the carcasses of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away.
\[34]Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.

t that time, said the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:
\[2]And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung on the face of the earth.
\[3]And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places where I have driven them, said the LORD of hosts.
\[4]Moreover you shall say to them, Thus said the LORD; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?
\[5]Why then is this people of Jerusalem slid back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.
\[6]I listened and heard, but they spoke not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rushes into the battle.
\[7]Yes, the stork in the heaven knows her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.
\[8]How do you say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us? See, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain.
\[9]The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: see, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?
\[10]Therefore will I give their wives to others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely.
\[11]For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
\[12]Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? no, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, said the LORD.
\[13]I will surely consume them, said the LORD: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.
\[14]Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defended cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God has put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.
\[15]We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble!
\[16]The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.
\[17]For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, said the LORD.
\[18]When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me.
\[19]Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with strange vanities?
\[20]The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
\[21]For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment has taken hold on me.
\[22]Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?

h that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!
\[2]Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.
\[3]And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth on the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, said the LORD.
\[4]Take you heed every one of his neighbor, and trust you not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will walk with slanders.
\[5]And they will deceive every one his neighbor, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity.
\[6]Your habitation is in the middle of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, said the LORD.
\[7]Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?
\[8]Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaks deceit: one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in heart he lays his wait.
\[9]Shall I not visit them for these things? said the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\[10]For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.
\[11]And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.
\[12]Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD has spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perishes and is burned up like a wilderness, that none passes through?
\[13]And the LORD said, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;
\[14]But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them:
\[15]Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.
\[16]I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.
\[17]Thus said the LORD of hosts, Consider you, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that they may come:
\[18]And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.
\[19]For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast us out.
\[20]Yet hear the word of the LORD, O you women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbor lamentation.
\[21]For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets.
\[22]Speak, Thus said the LORD, Even the carcasses of men shall fall as dung on the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather them.
\[23]Thus said the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches:
\[24]But let him that glories glory in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the LORD which exercise loving kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, said the LORD.
\[25]Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised;
\[26]Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.

ear you the word which the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel:
\[2]Thus said the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.
\[3]For the customs of the people are vain: for one cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the ax.
\[4]They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.
\[5]They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.
\[6]For as much as there is none like to you, O LORD; you are great, and your name is great in might.
\[7]Who would not fear you, O King of nations? for to you does it appertain: for as much as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like to you.
\[8]But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.
\[9]Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.
\[10]But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.
\[11]Thus shall you say to them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.
\[12]He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by his discretion.
\[13]When he utters his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightning with rain, and brings forth the wind out of his treasures.
\[14]Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
\[15]They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\[16]The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.
\[17]Gather up your wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.
\[18]For thus said the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.
\[19]Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.
\[20]My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
\[21]For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.
\[22]Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.
\[23]O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walks to direct his steps.
\[24]O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.
\[25]Pour out your fury on the heathen that know you not, and on the families that call not on your name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.

\[2]Hear you the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
\[3]And say you to them, Thus said the LORD God of Israel; Cursed be the man that obeys not the words of this covenant,
\[4]Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall you be my people, and I will be your God:
\[5]That I may perform the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.
\[6]Then the LORD said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear you the words of this covenant, and do them.
\[7]For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.
\[8]Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do: but they did them not.
\[9]And the LORD said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[10]They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.
\[11]Therefore thus said the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil on them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry to me, I will not listen to them.
\[12]Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry to the gods to whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
\[13]For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.
\[14]Therefore pray not you for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me for their trouble.
\[15]What has my beloved to do in my house, seeing she has worked lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from you? when you do evil, then you rejoice.
\[16]The LORD called your name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it, and the branches of it are broken.
\[17]For the LORD of hosts, that planted you, has pronounced evil against you, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense to Baal.
\[18]And the LORD has given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then you showed me their doings.
\[19]But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.
\[20]But, O LORD of hosts, that judge righteously, that try the reins and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them: for to you have I revealed my cause.
\[21]Therefore thus said the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek your life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that you die not by our hand:
\[22]Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:
\[23]And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.

\[2]You have planted them, yes, they have taken root: they grow, yes, they bring forth fruit: you are near in their mouth, and far from their reins.
\[3]But you, O LORD, know me: you have seen me, and tried my heart toward you: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
\[4]How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.
\[5]If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you, then how can you contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein you trusted, they wearied you, then how will you do in the swelling of Jordan?
\[6]For even your brothers, and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you; yes, they have called a multitude after you: believe them not, though they speak fair words to you.
\[7]I have forsaken my house, I have left my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
\[8]My heritage is to me as a lion in the forest; it cries out against me: therefore have I hated it.
\[9]My heritage is to me as a speckled bird, the birds round about are against her; come you, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.
\[10]Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
\[11]They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourns to me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man lays it to heart.
\[12]The spoilers are come on all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.
\[13]They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
\[14]Thus said the LORD against all my evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.
\[15]And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
\[16]And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD lives; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the middle of my people.
\[17]But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, said the LORD.

\[3]And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying,
\[4]Take the girdle that you have got, which is on your loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.
\[5]So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.
\[6]And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said to me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from there, which I commanded you to hide there.
\[7]Then I went to Euphrates, and dig, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.
\[8]Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[9]Thus said the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
\[10]This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing.
\[11]For as the girdle sticks to the loins of a man, so have I caused to stick to me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, said the LORD; that they might be to me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.
\[12]Therefore you shall speak to them this word; Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say to you, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?
\[13]Then shall you say to them, Thus said the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit on David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
\[14]And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, said the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.
\[15]Hear you, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD has spoken.
\[16]Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains, and, while you look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.
\[17]But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and my eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the LORD's flock is carried away captive.
\[18]Say to the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory.
\[19]The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive.
\[20]Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock?
\[21]What will you say when he shall punish you? for you have taught them to be captains, and as chief over you: shall not sorrows take you, as a woman in travail?
\[22]And if you say in your heart, Why come these things on me?  For the greatness of your iniquity are your skirts discovered, and your heels made bore.
\[23]Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may you also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.
\[24]Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passes away by the wind of the wilderness.
\[25]This is your lot, the portion of your measures from me, said the LORD; because you have forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.
\[26]Therefore will I discover your skirts on your face, that your shame may appear.
\[27]I have seen your adulteries, and your neighings, the lewdness of your prostitution, and your abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! will you not be made clean? when shall it once be?

\[2]Judah mourns, and the gates thereof languish; they are black to the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
\[3]And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.
\[4]Because the ground is beat down, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.
\[5]Yes, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no grass.
\[6]And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no grass.
\[7]O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do you it for your name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against you.
\[8]O the hope of Israel, the savior thereof in time of trouble, why should you be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turns aside to tarry for a night?
\[9]Why should you be as a man astonished, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet you, O LORD, are in the middle of us, and we are called by your name; leave us not.
\[10]Thus said the LORD to this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD does not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.
\[11]Then said the LORD to me, Pray not for this people for their good.
\[12]When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
\[13]Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say to them, You shall not see the sword, neither shall you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.
\[14]Then the LORD said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spoke to them: they prophesy to you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nothing, and the deceit of their heart.
\[15]Therefore thus said the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
\[16]And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness on them.
\[17]Therefore you shall say this word to them; Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.
\[18]If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword!  and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine!  yes, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.
\[19]Have you utterly rejected Judah? has your soul loathed Zion? why have you smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!
\[20]We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against you.
\[21]Do not abhor us, for your name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of your glory: remember, break not your covenant with us.
\[22]Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? are not you he, O LORD our God?  therefore we will wait on you: for you have made all these things.

hen said the LORD to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.
\[2]And it shall come to pass, if they say to you, Where shall we go forth? then you shall tell them, Thus said the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity.
\[3]And I will appoint over them four kinds, said the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.
\[4]And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.
\[5]For who shall have pity on you, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan you? or who shall go aside to ask how you do?
\[6]You have forsaken me, said the LORD, you are gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against you, and destroy you; I am weary with repenting.
\[7]And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people since they return not from their ways.
\[8]Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall on it suddenly, and terrors on the city.
\[9]She that has borne seven languishes: she has given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she has been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, said the LORD.
\[10]Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them does curse me.
\[11]The LORD said, Truly it shall be well with your remnant; truly I will cause the enemy to entreat you well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
\[12]Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?
\[13]Your substance and your treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all your sins, even in all your borders.
\[14]And I will make you to pass with your enemies into a land which you know not: for a fire is kindled in my anger, which shall burn on you.
\[15]O LORD, you know: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in your long-suffering: know that for your sake I have suffered rebuke.
\[16]Your words were found, and I did eat them; and your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by your name, O LORD God of hosts.
\[17]I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of your hand: for you have filled me with indignation.
\[18]Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? will you be altogether to me as a liar, and as waters that fail?
\[19]Therefore thus said the LORD, If you return, then will I bring you again, and you shall stand before me: and if you take forth the precious from the vile, you shall be as my mouth: let them return to you; but return not you to them.
\[20]And I will make you to this people a fenced brazen wall: and they shall fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you: for I am with you to save you and to deliver you, said the LORD.
\[21]And I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the hand of the terrible.

he word of the LORD came also to me, saying,
\[2]You shall not take you a wife, neither shall you have sons or daughters in this place.
\[3]For thus said the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bore them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land;
\[4]They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung on the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcasses shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
\[5]For thus said the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, said the LORD, even loving kindness and mercies.
\[6]Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:
\[7]Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
\[8]You shall not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.
\[9]For thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.
\[10]And it shall come to pass, when you shall show this people all these words, and they shall say to you, Why has the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?
\[11]Then shall you say to them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, said the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;
\[12]And you have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, you walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not listen to me:
\[13]Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that you know not, neither you nor your fathers; and there shall you serve other gods day and night; where I will not show you favor.
\[14]Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD lives, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
\[15]But, The LORD lives, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands where he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers.
\[16]Behold, I will send for many fishers, said the LORD, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.
\[17]For my eyes are on all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from my eyes.
\[18]And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled my inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable things.
\[19]O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come to you from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.
\[20]Shall a man make gods to himself, and they are no gods?

\[2]Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees on the high hills.
\[3]O my mountain in the field, I will give your substance and all your treasures to the spoil, and your high places for sin, throughout all your borders.
\[4]And you, even yourself, shall discontinue from your heritage that I gave you; and I will cause you to serve your enemies in the land which you know not: for you have kindled a fire in my anger, which shall burn for ever.
\[5]Thus said the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart departs from the LORD.
\[6]For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good comes; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.
\[7]Blessed is the man that trusts in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.
\[8]For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreads out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat comes, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.
\[9]The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?
\[10]I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.
\[11]As the partridge sits on eggs, and hatches them not; so he that gets riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the middle of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.
\[12]A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.
\[13]O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake you shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.
\[14]Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for you are my praise.
\[15]Behold, they say to me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it come now.
\[16]As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow you: neither have I desired the woeful day; you know: that which came out of my lips was right before you.
\[17]Be not a terror to me: you are my hope in the day of evil.
\[18]Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring on them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.
\[19]Thus said the LORD to me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;
\[20]And say to them, Hear you the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:
\[21]Thus said the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;
\[22]Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do you any work, but hallow you the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.
\[23]But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.
\[24]And it shall come to pass, if you diligently listen to me, said the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;
\[25]Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever.
\[26]And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, to the house of the LORD.
\[27]But if you will not listen to me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.

\[2]Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause you to hear my words.
\[3]Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he worked a work on the wheels.
\[4]And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.
\[5]Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[6]O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? said the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.
\[7]At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it;
\[8]If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them.
\[9]And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;
\[10]If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, with which I said I would benefit them.
\[11]Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus said the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return you now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.
\[12]And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.
\[13]Therefore thus said the LORD; Ask you now among the heathen, who has heard such things: the virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.
\[14]Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which comes from the rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?
\[15]Because my people has forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;
\[16]To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passes thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.
\[17]I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.
\[18]Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.
\[19]Give heed to me, O LORD, and listen to the voice of them that contend with me.
\[20]Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have dig a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before you to speak good for them, and to turn away your wrath from them.
\[21]Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle.
\[22]Let a cry be heard from their houses, when you shall bring a troop suddenly on them: for they have dig a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.
\[23]Yet, LORD, you know all their counsel against me to slay me: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from your sight, but let them be overthrown before you; deal thus with them in the time of your anger.

\[2]And go forth to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell you,
\[3]And say, Hear you the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil on this place, the which whoever hears, his ears shall tingle.
\[4]Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it to other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents;
\[5]They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:
\[6]Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter.
\[7]And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcasses will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
\[8]And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passes thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.
\[9]And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and narrow place, with which their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.
\[10]Then shall you break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with you,
\[11]And shall say to them, Thus said the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury.
\[12]Thus will I do to this place, said the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet:
\[13]And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.
\[14]Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD's house; and said to all the people,
\[15]Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring on this city and on all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.

\[3]And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah to him, The LORD has not called your name Pashur, but Magormissabib.
\[4]For thus said the LORD, Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself, and to all your friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall behold it: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.
\[5]Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labors thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.
\[6]And you, Pashur, and all that dwell in your house shall go into captivity: and you shall come to Babylon, and there you shall die, and shall be buried there, you, and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied lies.
\[7]O LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocks me.
\[8]For since I spoke, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach to me, and a derision, daily.
\[9]Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.
\[10]For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.
\[11]But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.
\[12]But, O LORD of hosts, that try the righteous, and see the reins and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them: for to you have I opened my cause.
\[13]Sing to the LORD, praise you the LORD: for he has delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.
\[14]Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bore me be blessed.
\[15]Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born to you; making him very glad.
\[16]And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide;
\[17]Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb to be always great with me.

\[5]And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.
\[6]And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.

\[10]For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, said the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
\[11]And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear you the word of the LORD;

\[3]Thus said the LORD; Execute you judgment and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place.
\[4]For if you do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.

\[7]And I will prepare destroyers against you, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down your choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.
\[8]And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbor, Why has the LORD done thus to this great city?
\[9]Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.
\[10]Weep you not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him that goes away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.
\[11]For thus said the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more:
\[12]But he shall die in the place where they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.
\[13]Woe to him that builds his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that uses his neighbor's service without wages, and gives him not for his work;
\[14]That said, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cuts him out windows; and it is paneled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
\[15]Shall you reign, because you close yourself in cedar? did not your father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him?
\[16]He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me? said the LORD.
\[17]But your eyes and your heart are not but for your covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.
\[18]Therefore thus said the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!
\[19]He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
\[20]Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up your voice in Bashan, and cry from the passages: for all your lovers are destroyed.
\[21]I spoke to you in your prosperity; but you said, I will not hear. This has been your manner from your youth, that you obeyed not my voice.
\[22]The wind shall eat up all your pastors, and your lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shall you be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness.
\[23]O inhabitant of Lebanon, that make your nest in the cedars, how gracious shall you be when pangs come on you, the pain as of a woman in travail!
\[24]As I live, said the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet on my right hand, yet would I pluck you there;
\[25]And I will give you into the hand of them that seek your life, and into the hand of them whose face you fear, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\[26]And I will cast you out, and your mother that bore you, into another country, where you were not born; and there shall you die.
\[27]But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they not return.
\[28]Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?

\[6]In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.
\[7]Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD lives, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
\[8]But, The LORD lives, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries where I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.
\[9]My heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness.
\[10]For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourns; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is not right.
\[11]For both prophet and priest are profane; yes, in my house have I found their wickedness, said the LORD.
\[12]Why their way shall be to them as slippery ways in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil on them, even the year of their visitation, said the LORD.
\[13]And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.
\[14]I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none does return from his wickedness; they are all of them to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
\[15]Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.
\[16]Thus said the LORD of hosts, Listen not to the words of the prophets that prophesy to you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the LORD.
\[17]They say still to them that despise me, The LORD has said, You shall have peace; and they say to every one that walks after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come on you.
\[18]For who has stood in the counsel of the LORD, and has perceived and heard his word? who has marked his word, and heard it?
\[19]Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously on the head of the wicked.
\[20]The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days you shall consider it perfectly.
\[21]I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.
\[22]But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
\[23]Am I a God at hand, said the LORD, and not a God afar off?
\[24]Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? said the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? said the LORD.
\[25]I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
\[26]How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yes, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart;
\[27]Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.
\[28]The prophet that has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that has my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? said the LORD.
\[29]Is not my word like as a fire? said the LORD; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?
\[30]Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, said the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbor.
\[31]Behold, I am against the prophets, said the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He said.
\[32]Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, said the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, said the LORD.
\[33]And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? you shall then say to them, What burden? I will even forsake you, said the LORD.
\[34]And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house.
\[35]Thus shall you say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What has the LORD answered? and, What has the LORD spoken?
\[36]And the burden of the LORD shall you mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for you have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.
\[37]Thus shall you say to the prophet, What has the LORD answered you? and, What has the LORD spoken?
\[38]But since you say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus said the LORD; Because you say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent to you, saying, You shall not say, The burden of the LORD;
\[39]Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence:
\[40]And I will bring an everlasting reproach on you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.

he LORD showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
\[2]One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.
\[3]Then said the LORD to me, What see you, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.
\[4]Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[5]Thus said the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.
\[6]For I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
\[7]And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return to me with their whole heart.
\[8]And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus said the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:
\[9]And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I shall drive them.
\[10]And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.

he word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;
\[2]The which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,
\[3]From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even to this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking; but you have not listened.
\[4]And the LORD has sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but you have not listened, nor inclined your ear to hear.
\[5]They said, Turn you again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD has given to you and to your fathers for ever and ever:
\[6]And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.
\[7]Yet you have not listened to me, said the LORD; that you might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.
\[8]Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts; Because you have not heard my words,
\[9]Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, said the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.
\[10]Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.
\[11]And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
\[12]And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, said the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.
\[13]And I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
\[14]For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.
\[15]For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.
\[16]And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.
\[17]Then took I the cup at the LORD's hand, and made all the nations to drink, to whom the LORD had sent me:
\[18]To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day;
\[19]Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;
\[20]And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,
\[21]Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,
\[22]And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea,
\[23]Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners,
\[24]And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert,
\[25]And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,
\[26]And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are on the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
\[27]Therefore you shall say to them, Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink you, and be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.
\[28]And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink, then shall you say to them, Thus said the LORD of hosts; You shall certainly drink.
\[29]For, see, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should you be utterly unpunished? You shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth, said the LORD of hosts.
\[30]Therefore prophesy you against them all these words, and say to them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar on his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
\[31]A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD has a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, said the LORD.
\[32]Thus said the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.
\[33]And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung on the ground.
\[34]Howl, you shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, you principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and you shall fall like a pleasant vessel.
\[35]And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.
\[36]A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the LORD has spoiled their pasture.
\[37]And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
\[38]He has forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.

n the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,
\[2]Thus said the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD's house, and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD's house, all the words that I command you to speak to them; diminish not a word:
\[3]If so be they will listen, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings.
\[4]And you shall say to them, Thus said the LORD; If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,
\[5]To listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent to you, both rising up early, and sending them, but you have not listened;
\[6]Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
\[7]So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
\[8]Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, You shall surely die.
\[9]Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant?  And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
\[10]When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house.
\[11]Then spoke the priests and the prophets to the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.
\[12]Then spoke Jeremiah to all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.
\[13]Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he has pronounced against you.
\[14]As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seems good and meet to you.
\[15]But know you for certain, that if you put me to death, you shall surely bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on this city, and on the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.
\[16]Then said the princes and all the people to the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.
\[17]Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,
\[18]Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
\[19]Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death?  did he not fear the LORD, and sought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.
\[20]And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.
\[21]And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;
\[22]And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.
\[23]And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
\[24]Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.

\[2]Thus said the LORD to me; Make you bonds and yokes, and put them on your neck,
\[3]And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;
\[4]And command them to say to their masters, Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall you say to your masters;
\[5]I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are on the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it to whom it seemed meet to me.
\[6]And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.
\[7]And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.
\[8]And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, said the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.
\[9]Therefore listen not you to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak to you, saying, You shall not serve the king of Babylon:
\[10]For they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and you should perish.
\[11]But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, said the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.
\[12]I spoke also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
\[13]Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD has spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
\[14]Therefore listen not to the words of the prophets that speak to you, saying, You shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie to you.
\[15]For I have not sent them, said the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that you might perish, you, and the prophets that prophesy to you.
\[16]Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus said the LORD; Listen not to the words of your prophets that prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD's house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie to you.
\[17]Listen not to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: why should this city be laid waste?
\[18]But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.
\[19]For thus said the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city.
\[20]Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
\[21]Yes, thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;
\[22]They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, said the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.

\[2]Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
\[3]Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon:
\[4]And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, said the LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
\[5]Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD,
\[6]Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD's house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.
\[7]Nevertheless hear you now this word that I speak in your ears, and in the ears of all the people;
\[8]The prophets that have been before me and before you of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
\[9]The prophet which prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD has truly sent him.
\[10]Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and broke it.
\[11]And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus said the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
\[12]Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
\[13]Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus said the LORD; You have broken the yokes of wood; but you shall make for them yokes of iron.
\[14]For thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.
\[15]Then said the prophet Jeremiah to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD has not sent you; but you make this people to trust in a lie.
\[16]Therefore thus said the LORD; Behold, I will cast you from off the face of the earth: this year you shall die, because you have taught rebellion against the LORD.

\[2](After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)
\[3]By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,
\[4]Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon;
\[5]Build you houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;
\[6]Take you wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that you may be increased there, and not diminished.
\[7]And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray to the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall you have peace.
\[8]For thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that be in the middle of you, deceive you, neither listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed.
\[9]For they prophesy falsely to you in my name: I have not sent them, said the LORD.
\[10]For thus said the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.
\[11]For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, said the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.
\[12]Then shall you call on me, and you shall go and pray to me, and I will listen to you.
\[13]And you shall seek me, and find me, when you shall search for me with all your heart.
\[14]And I will be found of you, said the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, said the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place from where I caused you to be carried away captive.
\[15]Because you have said, The LORD has raised us up prophets in Babylon;
\[16]Know that thus said the LORD of the king that sits on the throne of David, and of all the people that dwells in this city, and of your brothers that are not gone forth with you into captivity;
\[17]Thus said the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.
\[18]And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations where I have driven them:
\[19]Because they have not listened to my words, said the LORD, which I sent to them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but you would not hear, said the LORD.
\[20]Hear you therefore the word of the LORD, all you of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:
\[21]Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie to you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;
\[22]And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;
\[23]Because they have committed villainy in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, said the LORD.
\[24]Thus shall you also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,
\[25]Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because you have sent letters in your name to all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
\[26]The LORD has made you priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that you should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in prison, and in the stocks.
\[27]Now therefore why have you not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which makes himself a prophet to you?
\[28]For therefore he sent to us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build you houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
\[29]And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
\[30]Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying,
\[31]Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus said the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:
\[32]Therefore thus said the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, said the LORD; because he has taught rebellion against the LORD.

\[2]Thus speaks the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write you all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.
\[3]For, see, the days come, said the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, said the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
\[4]And these are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
\[5]For thus said the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.
\[6]Ask you now, and see whether a man does travail with child? why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
\[7]Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.
\[8]For it shall come to pass in that day, said the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and will burst your bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:
\[9]But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.
\[10]Therefore fear you not, O my servant Jacob, said the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, see, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.
\[11]For I am with you, said the LORD, to save you: though I make a full end of all nations where I have scattered you, yet I will not make a full end of you: but I will correct you in measure, and will not leave you altogether unpunished.
\[12]For thus said the LORD, Your bruise is incurable, and your wound is grievous.
\[13]There is none to plead your cause, that you may be bound up: you have no healing medicines.
\[14]All your lovers have forgotten you; they seek you not; for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of your iniquity; because your sins were increased.
\[15]Why cry you for your affliction? your sorrow is incurable for the multitude of your iniquity: because your sins were increased, I have done these things to you.
\[16]Therefore all they that devour you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil you shall be a spoil, and all that prey on you will I give for a prey.
\[17]For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, said the LORD; because they called you an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeks after.
\[18]Thus said the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwelling places; and the city shall be built on her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.
\[19]And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
\[20]Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.
\[21]And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the middle of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach to me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach to me? said the LORD.
\[22]And you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
\[23]Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goes forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain on the head of the wicked.
\[24]The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he has done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days you shall consider it.

t the same time, said the LORD, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.
\[2]Thus said the LORD, The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.
\[3]The LORD has appeared of old to me, saying, Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love: therefore with loving kindness have I drawn you.
\[4]Again I will build you, and you shall be built, O virgin of Israel: you shall again be adorned with your tabrets, and shall go forth in the dances of them that make merry.
\[5]You shall yet plant vines on the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.
\[6]For there shall be a day, that the watchmen on the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise you, and let us go up to Zion to the LORD our God.
\[7]For thus said the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish you, praise you, and say, O LORD, save your people, the remnant of Israel.
\[8]Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travails with child together: a great company shall return thither.
\[9]They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.
\[10]Hear the word of the LORD, O you nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd does his flock.
\[11]For the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.
\[12]Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.
\[13]Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
\[14]And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, said the LORD.
\[15]Thus said the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.
\[16]Thus said the LORD; Refrain your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears: for your work shall be rewarded, said the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.
\[17]And there is hope in your end, said the LORD, that your children shall come again to their own border.
\[18]I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn you me, and I shall be turned; for you are the LORD my God.
\[19]Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote on my thigh: I was ashamed, yes, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.
\[20]Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spoke against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy on him, said the LORD.
\[21]Set you up markers, make you high heaps: set your heart toward the highway, even the way which you went: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these your cities.
\[22]How long will you go about, O you backsliding daughter? for the LORD has created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.
\[23]Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless you, O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.
\[24]And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, farmers, and they that go forth with flocks.
\[25]For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.
\[26]On this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet to me.
\[27]Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.
\[28]And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, said the LORD.
\[29]In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.
\[30]But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eats the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.
\[31]Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
\[32]Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they broke, although I was an husband to them, said the LORD:
\[33]But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, said the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.
\[34]And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, said the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
\[35]Thus said the LORD, which gives the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divides the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name:
\[36]If those ordinances depart from before me, said the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.
\[37]Thus said the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, said the LORD.
\[38]Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel to the gate of the corner.
\[39]And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it on the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.
\[40]And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields to the brook of Kidron, to the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy to the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.

he word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
\[2]For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house.
\[3]For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy, and say, Thus said the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
\[4]And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;
\[5]And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, said the LORD: though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not prosper.
\[6]And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[7]Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you saying, Buy you my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is your to buy it.
\[8]So Hanameel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said to me, Buy my field, I pray you, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.  Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.
\[9]And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.
\[10]And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.
\[11]So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open:
\[12]And I gave the evidence of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel my uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.
\[13]And I charged Baruch before them, saying,
\[14]Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.
\[15]For thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.
\[16]Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying,
\[17]Ah Lord GOD! behold, you have made the heaven and the earth by your great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for you:
\[18]You show loving kindness to thousands, and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name,
\[19]Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for your eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:
\[20]Which have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and have made you a name, as at this day;
\[21]And have brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;
\[22]And have given them this land, which you did swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
\[23]And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not your voice, neither walked in your law; they have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do: therefore you have caused all this evil to come on them:
\[24]Behold the mounts, they are come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what you have spoken is come to pass; and, behold, you see it.
\[25]And you have said to me, O Lord GOD, Buy you the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\[26]Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying,
\[27]Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?
\[28]Therefore thus said the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:
\[29]And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.
\[30]For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, said the LORD.
\[31]For this city has been to me as a provocation of my anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before my face,
\[32]Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[33]And they have turned to me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction.
\[34]But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.
\[35]And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
\[36]And now therefore thus said the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof you say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;
\[37]Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, where I have driven them in my anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:
\[38]And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:
\[39]And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:
\[40]And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.
\[41]Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
\[42]For thus said the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil on this people, so will I bring on them all the good that I have promised them.
\[43]And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof you say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\[44]Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, said the LORD.

oreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,
\[2]Thus said the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD is his name;
\[3]Call to me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you know not.
\[4]For thus said the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;
\[5]They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in my anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.
\[6]Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth.
\[7]And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.
\[8]And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.
\[9]And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honor before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure to it.
\[10]Thus said the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which you say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,
\[11]The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endures for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, said the LORD.
\[12]Thus said the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.
\[13]In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that tells them, said the LORD.
\[14]Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.
\[15]In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.
\[16]In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name with which she shall be called, The LORD our righteousness.
\[17]For thus said the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;
\[18]Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.
\[19]And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
\[20]Thus said the LORD; If you can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;
\[21]Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
\[22]As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister to me.
\[23]Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
\[24]Consider you not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD has chosen, he has even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.
\[25]Thus said the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;
\[26]Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.

he word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,
\[2]Thus said the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus said the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:
\[3]And you shall not escape out of his hand, but shall surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and your eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with you mouth to mouth, and you shall go to Babylon.
\[4]Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus said the LORD of you, You shall not die by the sword:
\[5]But you shall die in peace: and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings which were before you, so shall they burn odors for you; and they will lament you, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, said the LORD.
\[6]Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,
\[7]When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defended cities remained of the cities of Judah.
\[8]This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;
\[9]That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.
\[10]Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.
\[11]But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.
\[12]Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
\[13]Thus said the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves, saying,
\[14]At the end of seven years let you go every man his brother an Hebrew, which has been sold to you; and when he has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you: but your fathers listened not to me, neither inclined their ear.
\[15]And you were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor; and you had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:
\[16]But you turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.
\[17]Therefore thus said the LORD; You have not listened to me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, said the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.
\[18]And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in two, and passed between the parts thereof,
\[19]The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;
\[20]I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat to the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.
\[21]And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.
\[22]Behold, I will command, said the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.

\[2]Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.
\[3]Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;
\[4]And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:
\[5]And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said to them, Drink you wine.
\[6]But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your sons for ever:
\[7]Neither shall you build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days you shall dwell in tents; that you may live many days in the land where you be strangers.
\[8]Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he has charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;
\[9]Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:
\[10]But we have dwelled in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
\[11]But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.
\[12]Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying,
\[13]Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you not receive instruction to listen to my words? said the LORD.
\[14]The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for to this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking; but you listened not to me.
\[15]I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return you now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and you shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but you have not inclined your ear, nor listened to me.
\[16]Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people has not listened to me:
\[17]Therefore thus said the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard; and I have called to them, but they have not answered.
\[18]And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he has commanded you:
\[19]Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.

\[3]It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
\[4]Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken to him, on a roll of a book.
\[5]And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD:
\[6]Therefore go you, and read in the roll, which you have written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD's house on the fasting day: and also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.
\[7]It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD has pronounced against this people.
\[8]And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD's house.
\[9]And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem.
\[10]Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.
\[11]When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,
\[12]Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, see, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.
\[13]Then Michaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.
\[14]Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take in your hand the roll wherein you have read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came to them.
\[15]And they said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.
\[16]Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.
\[17]And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did you write all these words at his mouth?
\[18]Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.
\[19]Then said the princes to Baruch, Go, hide you, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know where you be.
\[20]And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.
\[21]So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.
\[22]Now the king sat in the winter house in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.
\[23]And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.
\[24]Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.
\[25]Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.
\[26]But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.
\[27]Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
\[28]Take you again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.
\[29]And you shall say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus said the LORD; You have burned this roll, saying, Why have you written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from there man and beast?
\[30]Therefore thus said the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit on the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.
\[31]And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they listened not.
\[32]Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides to them many like words.

nd king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.
\[2]But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did listen to the words of the LORD, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.
\[3]And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to the LORD our God for us.
\[4]Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.
\[5]Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.
\[6]Then came the word of the LORD to the prophet Jeremiah saying,
\[7]Thus said the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall you say to the king of Judah, that sent you to me to inquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.
\[8]And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.
\[9]Thus said the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.
\[10]For though you had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.
\[11]And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,
\[12]Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself there in the middle of the people.
\[13]And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You fall away to the Chaldeans.
\[14]Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans.  But he listened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.
\[15]Why the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.
\[16]When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;
\[17]Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, you shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.
\[18]Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, What have I offended against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?
\[19]Where are now your prophets which prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?
\[20]Therefore hear now, I pray you, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray you, be accepted before you; that you cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
\[21]Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent.  Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

hen Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying,
\[2]Thus said the LORD, He that remains in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.
\[3]Thus said the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.
\[4]Therefore the princes said to the king, We beseech you, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakens the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man seeks not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
\[5]Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.
\[6]Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.
\[7]Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;
\[8]Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spoke to the king saying,
\[9]My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.
\[10]Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.
\[11]So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took there old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
\[12]And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under your armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.
\[13]So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
\[14]Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask you a thing; hide nothing from me.
\[15]Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? and if I give you counsel, will you not listen to me?
\[16]So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD lives, that made us this soul, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men that seek your life.
\[17]Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, Thus said the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If you will assuredly go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then your soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and you shall live, and your house:
\[18]But if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape out of their hand.
\[19]And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.
\[20]But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver you. Obey, I beseech you, the voice of the LORD, which I speak to you: so it shall be well to you, and your soul shall live.
\[21]But if you refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD has showed me:
\[22]And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Your friends have set you on, and have prevailed against you: your feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.
\[23]So they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans: and you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.
\[24]Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die.
\[25]But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and say to you, Declare to us now what you have said to the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put you to death; also what the king said to you:
\[26]Then you shall say to them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.
\[27]Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.
\[28]So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.

n the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.
\[2]And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.
\[3]And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.
\[4]And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate between the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.
\[5]But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment on him.
\[6]Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.
\[7]Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.
\[8]And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
\[9]Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.
\[10]But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
\[11]Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,
\[12]Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do to him even as he shall say to you.
\[13]So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;
\[14]Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelled among the people.
\[15]Now the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,
\[16]Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words on this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before you.
\[17]But I will deliver you in that day, said the LORD: and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.
\[18]For I will surely deliver you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but your life shall be for a prey to you: because you have put your trust in me, said the LORD.

he word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive to Babylon.
\[2]And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, The LORD your God has pronounced this evil on this place.
\[3]Now the LORD has brought it, and done according as he has said: because you have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come on you.
\[4]And now, behold, I loose you this day from the chains which were on your hand. If it seem good to you to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well to you: but if it seem ill to you to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before you: where it seems good and convenient for you to go, thither go.
\[5]Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wherever it seems convenient to you to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.
\[6]Then went Jeremiah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelled with him among the people that were left in the land.
\[7]Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;
\[8]Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
\[9]And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
\[10]As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, which will come to us: but you, gather you wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.
\[11]Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;
\[12]Even all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.
\[13]Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
\[14]And said to him, Do you certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay you? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.
\[15]Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly saying, Let me go, I pray you, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: why should he slay you, that all the Jews which are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?
\[16]But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, You shall not do this thing: for you speak falsely of Ishmael.

ow it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.
\[2]Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
\[3]Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war.
\[4]And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,
\[5]That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD.
\[6]And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said to them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
\[7]And it was so, when they came into the middle of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the middle of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.
\[8]But ten men were found among them that said to Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he declined, and slew them not among their brothers.
\[9]Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.
\[10]Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.
\[11]But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
\[12]Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.
\[13]Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad.
\[14]So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.
\[15]But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.
\[16]Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:
\[17]And they departed, and dwelled in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,

\[3]That the LORD your God may show us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do.

\[6]Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.

\[14]Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:
\[15]And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, you remnant of Judah; Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If you wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;
\[16]Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which you feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof you were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there you shall die.
\[17]So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.
\[18]For thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As my anger and my fury has been poured forth on the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth on you, when you shall enter into Egypt: and you shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and you shall see this place no more.
\[19]The LORD has said concerning you, O you remnant of Judah; Go you not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.
\[20]For you dissembled in your hearts, when you sent me to the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us to the LORD our God; and according to all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare to us, and we will do it.
\[21]And now I have this day declared it to you; but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he has sent me to you.
\[22]Now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place where you desire to go and to sojourn.

\[10]And say to them, Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne on these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.
\[11]And when he comes, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword.
\[12]And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he shall go forth from there in peace.
\[13]He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.

he word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,
\[2]Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; You have seen all the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, and on all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwells therein,
\[3]Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, you, nor your fathers.
\[4]However, I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.
\[5]But they listened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to other gods.
\[6]Why my fury and my anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.
\[7]Therefore now thus said the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Why commit you this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;
\[8]In that you provoke me to wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you be gone to dwell, that you might cut yourselves off, and that you might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
\[9]Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\[10]They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.
\[11]Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.
\[12]And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
\[13]For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:
\[14]So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.
\[15]Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense to other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelled in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
\[16]As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will not listen to you.
\[17]But we will certainly do whatever thing goes forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.
\[18]But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.
\[19]And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her, without our men?
\[20]Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying,
\[21]The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind?
\[22]So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which you have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.
\[23]Because you have burned incense, and because you have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened to you, as at this day.
\[24]Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:
\[25]Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; You and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her: you will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.
\[26]Therefore hear you the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, said the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD lives.
\[27]Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.
\[28]Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or their's.
\[29]And this shall be a sign to you, said the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that you may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:
\[30]Thus said the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.

\[2]Thus said the LORD, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:
\[3]You did say, Woe is me now! for the LORD has added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.
\[4]Thus shall you say to him, The LORD said thus; Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land.
\[5]And seek you great things for yourself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh, said the LORD: but your life will I give to you for a prey in all places where you go.

he word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles;
\[2]Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.
\[3]Order you the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
\[4]Harness the horses; and get up, you horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines.
\[5]Why have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: for fear was round about, said the LORD.
\[6]Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.
\[7]Who is this that comes up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?
\[8]Egypt rises up like a flood, and his waters are moved like the rivers; and he said, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.
\[9]Come up, you horses; and rage, you chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.
\[10]For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts has a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.
\[11]Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shall you use many medicines; for you shall not be cured.
\[12]The nations have heard of your shame, and your cry has filled the land: for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty, and they are fallen both together.
\[13]The word that the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt.
\[14]Declare you in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say you, Stand fast, and prepare you; for the sword shall devour round about you.
\[15]Why are your valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them.
\[16]He made many to fall, yes, one fell on another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.
\[17]They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he has passed the time appointed.
\[18]As I live, said the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.
\[19]O you daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish yourself to go into captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.
\[20]Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction comes; it comes out of the north.
\[21]Also her hired men are in the middle of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come on them, and the time of their visitation.
\[22]The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.
\[23]They shall cut down her forest, said the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.
\[24]The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.
\[25]The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, said; Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him:
\[26]And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, said the LORD.
\[27]But fear not you, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar off, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.
\[28]Fear you not, O Jacob my servant, said the LORD: for I am with you; for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you: but I will not make a full end of you, but correct you in measure; yet will I not leave you wholly unpunished.

\[3]At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands;
\[4]Because of the day that comes to spoil all the Philistines, and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remains: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.
\[5]Baldness is come on Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley: how long will you cut yourself?
\[6]O you sword of the LORD, how long will it be ere you be quiet? put up yourself into your scabbard, rest, and be still.
\[7]How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD has given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there has he appointed it.

gainst Moab thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe to Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded and taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.
\[2]There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also you shall be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue you.
\[3]A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.
\[4]Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
\[5]For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.
\[6]Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
\[7]For because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures, you shall also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together.
\[8]And the spoiler shall come on every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD has spoken.
\[9]Give wings to Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.
\[10]Cursed be he that does the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed be he that keeps back his sword from blood.
\[11]Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees, and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.
\[12]Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will send to him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.
\[13]And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.
\[14]How say you, We are mighty and strong men for the war?
\[15]Moab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, said the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.
\[16]The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hastens fast.
\[17]All you that are about him, bemoan him; and all you that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, and the beautiful rod!
\[18]You daughter that do inhabit Dibon, come down from your glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come on you, and he shall destroy your strong holds.
\[19]O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that flees, and her that escapes, and say, What is done?
\[20]Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell you it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,
\[21]And judgment is come on the plain country; on Holon, and on Jahazah, and on Mephaath,
\[22]And on Dibon, and on Nebo, and on Bethdiblathaim,
\[23]And on Kiriathaim, and on Bethgamul, and on Bethmeon,
\[24]And on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, and on all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.
\[25]The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, said the LORD.
\[26]Make you him drunken: for he magnified himself against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.
\[27]For was not Israel a derision to you? was he found among thieves?  for since you spoke of him, you skipped for joy.
\[28]O you that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove that makes her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.
\[29]We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogance, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.
\[30]I know his wrath, said the LORD; but it shall not be so; his lies shall not so effect it.
\[31]Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; my heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.
\[32]O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for you with the weeping of Jazer: your plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen on your summer fruits and on your vintage.
\[33]And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.
\[34]From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh, and even to Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.
\[35]Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, said the LORD, him that offers in the high places, and him that burns incense to his gods.
\[36]Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and my heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches that he has gotten are perished.
\[37]For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: on all the hands shall be cuttings, and on the loins sackcloth.
\[38]There shall be lamentation generally on all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, said the LORD.
\[39]They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how has Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.
\[40]For thus said the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.
\[41]Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
\[42]And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he has magnified himself against the LORD.
\[43]Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be on you, O inhabitant of Moab, said the LORD.
\[44]He that flees from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring on it, even on Moab, the year of their visitation, said the LORD.
\[45]They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the middle of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
\[46]Woe be to you, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perishes: for your sons are taken captives, and your daughters captives.
\[47]Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, said the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.

\[2]Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir to them that were his heirs, said the LORD.
\[3]Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, you daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.
\[4]Why glory you in the valleys, your flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come to me?
\[5]Behold, I will bring a fear on you, said the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about you; and you shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wanders.
\[6]And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, said the LORD.
\[7]Concerning Edom, thus said the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?
\[8]Flee you, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him, the time that I will visit him.
\[9]If grape gatherers come to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.
\[10]But I have made Esau bore, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brothers, and his neighbors, and he is not.
\[11]Leave your fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let your widows trust in me.
\[12]For thus said the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and are you he that shall altogether go unpunished? you shall not go unpunished, but you shall surely drink of it.
\[13]For I have sworn by myself, said the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.
\[14]I have heard a rumor from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent to the heathen, saying, Gather you together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.
\[15]For, see, I will make you small among the heathen, and despised among men.
\[16]Your terribleness has deceived you, and the pride of your heart, O you that dwell in the clefts of the rock, that hold the height of the hill: though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, said the LORD.
\[17]Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goes by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.
\[18]As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, said the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.
\[19]Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
\[20]Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he has taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.
\[21]The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.
\[22]Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
\[23]Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.
\[24]Damascus is waxed feeble, and turns herself to flee, and fear has seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.
\[25]How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!
\[26]Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, said the LORD of hosts.
\[27]And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.
\[28]Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus said the LORD; Arise you, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.
\[29]Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry to them, Fear is on every side.
\[30]Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O you inhabitants of Hazor, said the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you, and has conceived a purpose against you.
\[31]Arise, get you up to the wealthy nation, that dwells without care, said the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone.
\[32]And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, said the LORD.
\[33]And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.

\[36]And on Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.
\[37]For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil on them, even my fierce anger, said the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:
\[38]And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from there the king and the princes, said the LORD.
\[39]But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, said the LORD.

he word that the LORD spoke against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.
\[2]Declare you among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.
\[3]For out of the north there comes up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.
\[4]In those days, and in that time, said the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.
\[5]They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.
\[6]My people has been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their resting place.
\[7]All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.
\[8]Remove out of the middle of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.
\[9]For, see, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from there she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.
\[10]And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, said the LORD.
\[11]Because you were glad, because you rejoiced, O you destroyers of my heritage, because you are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;
\[12]Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bore you shall be ashamed: behold, the last of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
\[13]Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goes by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.
\[14]Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all you that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she has sinned against the LORD.
\[15]Shout against her round about: she has given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance on her; as she has done, do to her.
\[16]Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handles the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.
\[17]Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria has devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones.
\[18]Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.
\[19]And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied on mount Ephraim and Gilead.
\[20]In those days, and in that time, said the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.
\[21]Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, said the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded you.
\[22]A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.
\[23]How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
\[24]I have laid a snare for you, and you are also taken, O Babylon, and you were not aware: you are found, and also caught, because you have striven against the LORD.
\[25]The LORD has opened his armory, and has brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.
\[26]Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.
\[27]Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
\[28]The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.
\[29]Call together the archers against Babylon: all you that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she has done, do to her: for she has been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.
\[30]Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, said the LORD.
\[31]Behold, I am against you, O you most proud, said the Lord GOD of hosts: for your day is come, the time that I will visit you.
\[32]And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.
\[33]Thus said the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.
\[34]Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
\[35]A sword is on the Chaldeans, said the LORD, and on the inhabitants of Babylon, and on her princes, and on her wise men.
\[36]A sword is on the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is on her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.
\[37]A sword is on their horses, and on their chariots, and on all the mingled people that are in the middle of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is on her treasures; and they shall be robbed.
\[38]A drought is on her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad on their idols.
\[39]Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelled in from generation to generation.
\[40]As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, said the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.
\[41]Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.
\[42]They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not show mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride on horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against you, O daughter of Babylon.
\[43]The king of Babylon has heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.
\[44]Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan to the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
\[45]Therefore hear you the counsel of the LORD, that he has taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.
\[46]At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.

hus said the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the middle of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind;
\[2]And will send to Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.
\[3]Against him that bends let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifts himself up in his brigandine: and spare you not her young men; destroy you utterly all her host.
\[4]Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets.
\[5]For Israel has not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.
\[6]Flee out of the middle of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance; he will render to her a recompense.
\[7]Babylon has been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.
\[8]Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.
\[9]We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reaches to heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.
\[10]The LORD has brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.
\[11]Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD has raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.
\[12]Set up the standard on the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD has both devised and done that which he spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.
\[13]O you that dwell on many waters, abundant in treasures, your end is come, and the measure of your covetousness.
\[14]The LORD of hosts has sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill you with men, as with caterpillars; and they shall lift up a shout against you.
\[15]He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heaven by his understanding.
\[16]When he utters his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth: he makes lightning with rain, and brings forth the wind out of his treasures.
\[17]Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
\[18]They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\[19]The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name.
\[20]You are my battle ax and weapons of war: for with you will I break in pieces the nations, and with you will I destroy kingdoms;
\[21]And with you will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with you will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;
\[22]With you also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with you will I break in pieces old and young; and with you will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;
\[23]I will also break in pieces with you the shepherd and his flock; and with you will I break in pieces the farmer and his yoke of oxen; and with you will I break in pieces captains and rulers.
\[24]And I will render to Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, said the LORD.
\[25]Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, said the LORD, which destroy all the earth: and I will stretch out my hand on you, and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you a burnt mountain.
\[26]And they shall not take of you a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but you shall be desolate for ever, said the LORD.
\[27]Set you up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars.
\[28]Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion.
\[29]And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.
\[30]The mighty men of Babylon have declined to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might has failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwelling places; her bars are broken.
\[31]One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end,
\[32]And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.
\[33]For thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.
\[34]Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me, he has crushed me, he has made me an empty vessel, he has swallowed me up like a dragon, he has filled his belly with my delicates, he has cast me out.
\[35]The violence done to me and to my flesh be on Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood on the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.
\[36]Therefore thus said the LORD; Behold, I will plead your cause, and take vengeance for you; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.
\[37]And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.
\[38]They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions' whelps.
\[39]In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, said the LORD.
\[40]I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.
\[41]How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!
\[42]The sea is come up on Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.
\[43]Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwells, neither does any son of man pass thereby.
\[44]And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more to him: yes, the wall of Babylon shall fall.
\[45]My people, go you out of the middle of her, and deliver you every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.
\[46]And lest your heart faint, and you fear for the rumor that shall be heard in the land; a rumor shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumor, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.
\[47]Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment on the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the middle of her.
\[48]Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come to her from the north, said the LORD.
\[49]As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.
\[50]You that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
\[51]We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame has covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD's house.
\[52]Why, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will do judgment on her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.
\[53]Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come to her, said the LORD.
\[54]A sound of a cry comes from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:
\[55]Because the LORD has spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:
\[56]Because the spoiler is come on her, even on Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompenses shall surely requite.
\[57]And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, said the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.
\[58]Thus said the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labor in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.
\[59]The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.
\[60]So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.
\[61]And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When you come to Babylon, and shall see, and shall read all these words;
\[62]Then shall you say, O LORD, you have spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.
\[63]And it shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the middle of Euphrates:
\[64]And you shall say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring on her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.

edekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\[2]And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
\[3]For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
\[4]And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about.
\[5]So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
\[6]And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
\[7]Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.
\[8]But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
\[9]Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment on him.
\[10]And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
\[11]Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
\[12]Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,
\[13]And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with fire:
\[14]And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
\[15]Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
\[16]But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for farmers.
\[17]Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
\[18]The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, took they away.
\[19]And the basins, and the fire pans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away.
\[20]The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
\[21]And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.
\[22]And a capital of brass was on it; and the height of one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capitals round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like to these.
\[23]And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates on the network were an hundred round about.
\[24]And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:
\[25]He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and three score men of the people of the land, that were found in the middle of the city.
\[26]So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
\[27]And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.
\[28]This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:
\[29]In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:
\[30]In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.
\[31]And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison.
\[32]And spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,
\[33]And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life.
\[34]And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.

ow does the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!
\[2]She weeps sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she has none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.
\[3]Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwells among the heathen, she finds no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.
\[4]The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.
\[5]Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.
\[6]And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.
\[7]Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.
\[8]Jerusalem has grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yes, she sighs, and turns backward.
\[9]Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembers not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy has magnified himself.
\[10]The adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things: for she has seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom you did command that they should not enter into your congregation.
\[11]All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile.
\[12]Is it nothing to you, all you that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like to my sorrow, which is done to me, with which the LORD has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.
\[13]From above has he sent fire into my bones, and it prevails against them: he has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back: he has made me desolate and faint all the day.
\[14]The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up on my neck: he has made my strength to fall, the LORD has delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up.
\[15]The LORD has trodden under foot all my mighty men in the middle of me: he has called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the LORD has trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a wine press.
\[16]For these things I weep; my eye, my eye runs down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.
\[17]Zion spreads forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the LORD has commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.
\[18]The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
\[19]I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and my elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.
\[20]Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; my heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaves, at home there is as death.
\[21]They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that you have done it: you will bring the day that you have called, and they shall be like to me.
\[22]Let all their wickedness come before you; and do to them, as you have done to me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.

ow has the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, and cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!
\[2]The LORD has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and has not pitied: he has thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he has brought them down to the ground: he has polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.
\[3]He has cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devours round about.
\[4]He has bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.
\[5]The LORD was as an enemy: he has swallowed up Israel, he has swallowed up all her palaces: he has destroyed his strong holds, and has increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
\[6]And he has violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden: he has destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD has caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and has despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.
\[7]The LORD has cast off his altar, he has abhorred his sanctuary, he has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.
\[8]The LORD has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he has stretched out a line, he has not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.
\[9]Her gates are sunk into the ground; he has destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.
\[10]The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground, and keep silence: they have cast up dust on their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
\[11]My eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured on the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.
\[12]They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.
\[13]What thing shall I take to witness for you? what thing shall I liken to you, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to you, that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? for your breach is great like the sea: who can heal you?
\[14]Your prophets have seen vain and foolish things for you: and they have not discovered your iniquity, to turn away your captivity; but have seen for you false burdens and causes of banishment.
\[15]All that pass by clap their hands at you; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?
\[16]All your enemies have opened their mouth against you: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.
\[17]The LORD has done that which he had devised; he has fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he has thrown down, and has not pitied: and he has caused your enemy to rejoice over you, he has set up the horn of your adversaries.
\[18]Their heart cried to the LORD, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give yourself no rest; let not the apple of your eye cease.
\[19]Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out your heart like water before the face of the LORD: lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.
\[20]Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom you have done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?
\[21]The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; you have slain them in the day of your anger; you have killed, and not pitied.
\[22]You have called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up has my enemy consumed.

 AM the man that has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
\[2]He has led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.
\[3]Surely against me is he turned; he turns his hand against me all the day.
\[4]My flesh and my skin has he made old; he has broken my bones.
\[5]He has built against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.
\[6]He has set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.
\[7]He has hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he has made my chain heavy.
\[8]Also when I cry and shout, he shuts out my prayer.
\[9]He has enclosed my ways with hewn stone, he has made my paths crooked.
\[10]He was to me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.
\[11]He has turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he has made me desolate.
\[12]He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
\[13]He has caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.
\[14]I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.
\[15]He has filled me with bitterness, he has made me drunken with wormwood.
\[16]He has also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he has covered me with ashes.
\[17]And you have removed my soul far off from peace: I forgot prosperity.
\[18]And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:
\[19]Remembering my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
\[20]My soul has them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
\[21]This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.
\[22]It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
\[23]They are new every morning: great is your faithfulness.
\[24]The LORD is my portion, said my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
\[25]The LORD is good to them that wait for him, to the soul that seeks him.
\[26]It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.
\[27]It is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth.
\[28]He sits alone and keeps silence, because he has borne it on him.
\[29]He puts his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.
\[30]He gives his cheek to him that smites him: he is filled full with reproach.
\[31]For the LORD will not cast off for ever:
\[32]But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.
\[33]For he does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.
\[34]To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth.
\[35]To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,
\[36]To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approves not.
\[37]Who is he that said, and it comes to pass, when the Lord commands it not?
\[38]Out of the mouth of the most High proceeds not evil and good?
\[39]Why does a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?
\[40]Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.
\[41]Let us lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens.
\[42]We have transgressed and have rebelled: you have not pardoned.
\[43]You have covered with anger, and persecuted us: you have slain, you have not pitied.
\[44]You have covered yourself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through.
\[45]You have made us as the offscouring and refuse in the middle of the people.
\[46]All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
\[47]Fear and a snare is come on us, desolation and destruction.
\[48]My eye runs down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
\[49]My eye trickles down, and ceases not, without any intermission.
\[50]Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.
\[51]My eye affects my heart because of all the daughters of my city.
\[52]My enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.
\[53]They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone on me.
\[54]Waters flowed over my head; then I said, I am cut off.
\[55]I called on your name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.
\[56]You have heard my voice: hide not your ear at my breathing, at my cry.
\[57]You drew near in the day that I called on you: you said, Fear not.
\[58]O LORD, you have pleaded the causes of my soul; you have redeemed my life.
\[59]O LORD, you have seen my wrong: judge you my cause.
\[60]You have seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.
\[61]You have heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me;
\[62]The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.
\[63]Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their music.
\[64]Render to them a recompense, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.
\[65]Give them sorrow of heart, your curse to them.
\[66]Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.

\[3]Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
\[4]The tongue of the sucking child sticks to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaks it to them.
\[5]They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
\[6]For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.
\[7]Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire:
\[8]Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin sticks to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.
\[9]They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field.
\[10]The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
\[11]The LORD has accomplished his fury; he has poured out his fierce anger, and has kindled a fire in Zion, and it has devoured the foundations thereof.
\[12]The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.

\[14]They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.
\[15]They cried to them, Depart you; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.
\[16]The anger of the LORD has divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders.
\[17]As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.
\[18]They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.
\[19]Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us on the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.
\[20]The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.
\[21]Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwell in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through to you: you shall be drunken, and shall make yourself naked.
\[22]The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry you away into captivity: he will visit your iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover your sins.

\[7]Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities.
\[8]Servants have ruled over us: there is none that does deliver us out of their hand.
\[9]We got our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.
\[10]Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.
\[11]They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of Judah.
\[12]Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honored.
\[13]They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.
\[14]The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music.

\[17]For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim.

ow it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
\[2]In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,
\[3]The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there on him.
\[4]And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.
\[5]Also out of the middle thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.
\[6]And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.
\[7]And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass.
\[8]And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.
\[9]Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.
\[10]As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.
\[11]Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
\[12]And they went every one straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.
\[13]As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
\[14]And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
\[15]Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel on the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.
\[16]The appearance of the wheels and their work was like to the color of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
\[17]When they went, they went on their four sides: and they turned not when they went.
\[18]As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.
\[19]And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
\[20]Wherever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\[21]When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\[22]And the likeness of the firmament on the heads of the living creature was as the color of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.
\[23]And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.
\[24]And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.
\[25]And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.
\[26]And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and on the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above on it.
\[27]And I saw as the color of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.
\[28]As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.

\[2]And the spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet, that I heard him that spoke to me.
\[3]And he said to me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even to this very day.
\[4]For they are impudent children and stiff hearted. I do send you to them; and you shall say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD.
\[5]And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them.
\[6]And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.
\[7]And you shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.
\[8]But you, son of man, hear what I say to you; Be not you rebellious like that rebellious house: open your mouth, and eat that I give you.
\[9]And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent to me; and, see, a roll of a book was therein;

\[2]So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.
\[3]And he said to me, Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this roll that I give you. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
\[4]And he said to me, Son of man, go, get you to the house of Israel, and speak with my words to them.
\[5]For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;
\[6]Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words you can not understand. Surely, had I sent you to them, they would have listened to you.
\[7]But the house of Israel will not listen to you; for they will not listen to me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.
\[8]Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.
\[9]As an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.
\[10]Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.
\[11]And go, get you to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus said the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
\[12]Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.
\[13]I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.
\[14]So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong on me.
\[15]Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelled by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.
\[16]And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[17]Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
\[18]When I say to the wicked, You shall surely die; and you give him not warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand.
\[19]Yet if you warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.
\[20]Again, When a righteous man does turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at your hand.
\[21]Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also you have delivered your soul.
\[22]And the hand of the LORD was there on me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you.
\[23]Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.
\[24]Then the spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet, and spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut yourself within your house.
\[25]But you, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands on you, and shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them:
\[26]And I will make your tongue sticks to the roof of your mouth, that you shall be dumb, and shall not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.
\[27]But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; He that hears, let him hear; and he that declines, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.

\[6]And when you have accomplished them, lie again on your right side, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed you each day for a year.

\[13]And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, where I will drive them.
\[14]Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul has not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.
\[15]Then he said to me, See, I have given you cow's dung for man's dung, and you shall prepare your bread therewith.

\[8]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against you, and will execute judgments in the middle of you in the sight of the nations.

\[13]Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest on them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.
\[14]Moreover I will make you waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about you, in the sight of all that pass by.
\[15]So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment to the nations that are round about you, when I shall execute judgments in you in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken it.
\[16]When I shall send on them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine on you, and will break your staff of bread:

\[21]And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.
\[22]My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.
\[23]Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.
\[24]Why I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.
\[25]Destruction comes; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.
\[26]Mischief shall come on mischief, and rumor shall be on rumor; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.
\[27]The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do to them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

nd it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there on me.
\[2]Then I beheld, and see a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the color of amber.
\[3]And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.
\[4]And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.
\[5]Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.
\[6]He said furthermore to me, Son of man, see you what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations.
\[7]And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.
\[8]Then said he to me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had dig in the wall, behold a door.
\[9]And he said to me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.
\[10]So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed on the wall round about.
\[11]And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the middle of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.
\[12]Then said he to me, Son of man, have you seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, the LORD sees us not; the LORD has forsaken the earth.
\[13]He said also to me, Turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations that they do.
\[14]Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.
\[15]Then said he to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations than these.
\[16]And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.
\[17]Then he said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, see, they put the branch to their nose.
\[18]Therefore will I also deal in fury: my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.

\[2]And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lies toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.
\[3]And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side;
\[4]And the LORD said to him, Go through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the middle thereof.
\[5]And to the others he said in my hearing, Go you after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have you pity:
\[6]Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man on whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.
\[7]And he said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go you forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.
\[8]And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell on my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring out of your fury on Jerusalem?
\[9]Then said he to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD has forsaken the earth, and the LORD sees not.
\[10]And as for me also, my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way on their head.
\[11]And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as you have commanded me.

\[2]And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill your hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.
\[3]Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.
\[4]Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD's glory.
\[5]And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaks.
\[6]And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.
\[7]And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.
\[8]And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings.
\[9]And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the color of a beryl stone.
\[10]And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the middle of a wheel.
\[11]When they went, they went on their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.
\[12]And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.
\[13]As for the wheels, it was cried to them in my hearing, O wheel.
\[14]And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
\[15]And the cherubim were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.
\[16]And when the cherubim went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.
\[17]When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.
\[18]Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.
\[19]And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
\[20]This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubim.
\[21]Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.

\[2]Then said he to me, Son of man, these are the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:
\[3]Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the flesh.
\[4]Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.
\[5]And the Spirit of the LORD fell on me, and said to me, Speak; Thus said the LORD; Thus have you said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.
\[6]You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled the streets thereof with the slain.
\[7]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Your slain whom you have laid in the middle of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the middle of it.
\[8]You have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword on you, said the Lord GOD.
\[9]And I will bring you out of the middle thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.
\[10]You shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and you shall know that I am the LORD.

\[12]And you shall know that I am the LORD: for you have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you.
\[13]And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?
\[14]Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[15]Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: to us is this land given in possession.
\[16]Therefore say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.
\[17]Therefore say, Thus said the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
\[18]And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from there.
\[19]And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:
\[20]That they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
\[21]But as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way on their own heads, said the Lord GOD.
\[22]Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
\[23]And the glory of the LORD went up from the middle of the city, and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city.
\[24]Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.

\[2]Son of man, you dwell in the middle of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.
\[3]Therefore, you son of man, prepare you stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and you shall remove from your place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house.
\[4]Then shall you bring forth your stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and you shall go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.
\[5]Dig you through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
\[6]In their sight shall you bear it on your shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight: you shall cover your face, that you see not the ground: for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel.
\[7]And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I dig through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bore it on my shoulder in their sight.
\[8]And in the morning came the word of the LORD to me, saying,
\[9]Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, What do you?
\[10]Say you to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them.
\[11]Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done to them: they shall remove and go into captivity.
\[12]And the prince that is among them shall bear on his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.
\[13]My net also will I spread on him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.
\[14]And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.
\[15]And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.
\[16]But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen where they come; and they shall know that I am the LORD.
\[17]Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[18]Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and with carefulness;
\[19]And say to the people of the land, Thus said the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.
\[20]And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[21]And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[22]Son of man, what is that proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?
\[23]Tell them therefore, Thus said the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say to them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.
\[24]For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.
\[25]For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, said the Lord GOD.

\[4]O Israel, your prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.
\[5]You have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.
\[6]They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD said: and the LORD has not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word.
\[7]Have you not seen a vain vision, and have you not spoken a lying divination, whereas you say, The LORD said it; albeit I have not spoken?
\[8]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Because you have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, said the Lord GOD.
\[9]And my hand shall be on the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
\[10]Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, see, others daubed it with untempered mortar:
\[11]Say to them which daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and you, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.
\[12]See, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said to you, Where is the daubing with which you have daubed it?
\[13]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.
\[14]So will I break down the wall that you have daubed with untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and you shall be consumed in the middle thereof: and you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[15]Thus will I accomplish my wrath on the wall, and on them that have daubed it with untempered mortar, and will say to you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;
\[16]To wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, said the Lord GOD.
\[17]Likewise, you son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy you against them,
\[18]And say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs on the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of my people, and will you save the souls alive that come to you?
\[19]And will you pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?
\[20]Why thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your pillows, with which you there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls that you hunt to make them fly.
\[21]Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[22]Because with lies you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:

\[5]That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
\[6]Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
\[7]For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojournes in Israel, which separates himself from me, and sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to a prophet to inquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:
\[8]And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the middle of my people; and you shall know that I am the LORD.

\[12]The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
\[13]Son of man, when the land sins against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out my hand on it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine on it, and will cut off man and beast from it:
\[14]Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, said the Lord GOD.
\[15]If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:
\[16]Though these three men were in it, as I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.
\[17]Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:
\[18]Though these three men were in it, as I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.
\[19]Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury on it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:
\[20]Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.
\[21]For thus said the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments on Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?
\[22]Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth to you, and you shall see their way and their doings: and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought on it.

\[4]And as for your nativity, in the day you were born your navel was not cut, neither were you washed in water to supple you; you were not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.
\[5]None eye pitied you, to do any of these to you, to have compassion on you; but you were cast out in the open field, to the loathing of your person, in the day that you were born.
\[6]And when I passed by you, and saw you polluted in your own blood, I said to you when you were in your blood, Live; yes, I said to you when you were in your blood, Live.
\[7]I have caused you to multiply as the bud of the field, and you have increased and waxen great, and you are come to excellent ornaments: your breasts are fashioned, and your hair is grown, whereas you were naked and bore.
\[8]Now when I passed by you, and looked on you, behold, your time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over you, and covered your nakedness: yes, I swore to you, and entered into a covenant with you, said the Lord GOD, and you became mine.
\[9]Then washed I you with water; yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil.
\[10]I clothed you also with broidered work, and shod you with badgers' skin, and I girded you about with fine linen, and I covered you with silk.
\[11]I decked you also with ornaments, and I put bracelets on your hands, and a chain on your neck.
\[12]And I put a jewel on your forehead, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.
\[13]Thus were you decked with gold and silver; and your raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; you did eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and you were exceeding beautiful, and you did prosper into a kingdom.
\[14]And your renown went forth among the heathen for your beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put on you, said the Lord GOD.
\[15]But you did trust in your own beauty, and played the harlot because of your renown, and poured out your fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.
\[16]And of your garments you did take, and decked your high places with divers colors, and played the harlot thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.
\[17]You have also taken your fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made to yourself images of men, and did commit prostitution with them,
\[18]And took your broidered garments, and covered them: and you have set my oil and my incense before them.
\[19]My meat also which I gave you, fine flour, and oil, and honey, with which I fed you, you have even set it before them for a sweet smell: and thus it was, said the Lord GOD.
\[20]Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to me, and these have you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Is this of your prostitutions a small matter,
\[21]That you have slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?
\[22]And in all your abominations and your prostitutions you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bore, and were polluted in your blood.
\[23]And it came to pass after all your wickedness, (woe, woe to you!  said the LORD GOD;)
\[24]That you have also built to you an eminent place, and have made you an high place in every street.
\[25]You have built your high place at every head of the way, and have made your beauty to be abhorred, and have opened your feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied your prostitutions.
\[26]You have also committed fornication with the Egyptians your neighbors, great of flesh; and have increased your prostitutions, to provoke me to anger.
\[27]Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished your ordinary food, and delivered you to the will of them that hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of your lewd way.
\[28]You have played the whore also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yes, you have played the harlot with them, and yet could not be satisfied.
\[29]You have moreover multiplied your fornication in the land of Canaan to Chaldea; and yet you were not satisfied therewith.
\[30]How weak is your heart, said the LORD GOD, seeing you do all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;
\[31]In that you build your eminent place in the head of every way, and make your high place in every street; and have not been as an harlot, in that you scorn hire;
\[32]But as a wife that commits adultery, which takes strangers instead of her husband!
\[33]They give gifts to all whores: but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and hire them, that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution.
\[34]And the contrary is in you from other women in your prostitutions, whereas none follows you to commit prostitutions: and in that you give a reward, and no reward is given to you, therefore you are contrary.
\[35]Why, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:
\[36]Thus said the Lord GOD; Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness discovered through your prostitutions with your lovers, and with all the idols of your abominations, and by the blood of your children, which you did give to them;
\[37]Behold, therefore I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have taken pleasure, and all them that you have loved, with all them that you have hated; I will even gather them round about against you, and will discover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.
\[38]And I will judge you, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give you blood in fury and jealousy.
\[39]And I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down your eminent place, and shall break down your high places: they shall strip you also of your clothes, and shall take your fair jewels, and leave you naked and bore.
\[40]They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords.
\[41]And they shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women: and I will cause you to cease from playing the harlot, and you also shall give no hire any more.
\[42]So will I make my fury toward you to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from you, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.
\[43]Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense your way on your head, said the Lord GOD: and you shall not commit this lewdness above all your abominations.
\[44]Behold, every one that uses proverbs shall use this proverb against you, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.
\[45]You are your mother's daughter, that lothes her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, which loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
\[46]And your elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at your left hand: and your younger sister, that dwells at your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.
\[47]Yet have you not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, you were corrupted more than they in all your ways.
\[48]As I live, said the Lord GOD, Sodom your sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and your daughters.
\[49]Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
\[50]And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.
\[51]Neither has Samaria committed half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters in all your abominations which you have done.
\[52]You also, which have judged your sisters, bear your own shame for your sins that you have committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than you: yes, be you confounded also, and bear your shame, in that you have justified your sisters.
\[53]When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of your captives in the middle of them:
\[54]That you may bear your own shame, and may be confounded in all that you have done, in that you are a comfort to them.
\[55]When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then you and your daughters shall return to your former estate.
\[56]For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,
\[57]Before your wickedness was discovered, as at the time of your reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise you round about.
\[58]You have borne your lewdness and your abominations, said the LORD.
\[59]For thus said the Lord GOD; I will even deal with you as you have done, which have despised the oath in breaking the covenant.
\[60]Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant.
\[61]Then you shall remember your ways, and be ashamed, when you shall receive your sisters, your elder and your younger: and I will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant.
\[62]And I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall know that I am the LORD:
\[63]That you may remember, and be confounded, and never open your mouth any more because of your shame, when I am pacified toward you for all that you have done, said the Lord GOD.

nd the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;
\[3]And say, Thus said the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, long winged, full of feathers, which had divers colors, came to Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:
\[4]He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants.
\[5]He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree.
\[6]And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.
\[7]There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.
\[8]It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.
\[9]Say you, Thus said the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.
\[10]Yes, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind touches it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.
\[11]Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[12]Say now to the rebellious house, Know you not what these things mean?  tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and has taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;
\[13]And has taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and has taken an oath of him: he has also taken the mighty of the land:
\[14]That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.
\[15]But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that does such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?
\[16]As I live, said the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwells that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the middle of Babylon he shall die.
\[17]Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:
\[18]Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, see, he had given his hand, and has done all these things, he shall not escape.
\[19]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; As I live, surely my oath that he has despised, and my covenant that he has broken, even it will I recompense on his own head.
\[20]And I will spread my net on him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me.
\[21]And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and you shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.
\[22]Thus said the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it on an high mountain and eminent:
\[23]In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.
\[24]And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.

he word of the LORD came to me again, saying,
\[2]What mean you, that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?
\[3]As I live, said the Lord GOD, you shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.
\[4]Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sins, it shall die.
\[5]But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,
\[6]And has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither has defiled his neighbor's wife, neither has come near to a menstruous woman,
\[7]And has not oppressed any, but has restored to the debtor his pledge, has spoiled none by violence, has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;
\[8]He that has not given forth on usury, neither has taken any increase, that has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, has executed true judgment between man and man,
\[9]Has walked in my statutes, and has kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, said the Lord GOD.
\[10]If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that does the like to any one of these things,
\[11]And that does not any of those duties, but even has eaten on the mountains, and defiled his neighbor's wife,
\[12]Has oppressed the poor and needy, has spoiled by violence, has not restored the pledge, and has lifted up his eyes to the idols, has committed abomination,
\[13]Has given forth on usury, and has taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be on him.
\[14]Now, see, if he beget a son, that sees all his father's sins which he has done, and considers, and does not such like,
\[15]That has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, has not defiled his neighbor's wife,
\[16]Neither has oppressed any, has not withheld the pledge, neither has spoiled by violence, but has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment,
\[17]That has taken off his hand from the poor, that has not received usury nor increase, has executed my judgments, has walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.
\[18]As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, see, even he shall die in his iniquity.
\[19]Yet say you, Why? does not the son bear the iniquity of the father?  When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live.
\[20]The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be on him.
\[21]But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
\[22]All his transgressions that he has committed, they shall not be mentioned to him: in his righteousness that he has done he shall live.
\[23]Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? said the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?
\[24]But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? All his righteousness that he has done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them shall he die.
\[25]Yet you say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?
\[26]When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies in them; for his iniquity that he has done shall he die.
\[27]Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.
\[28]Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
\[29]Yet said the house of Israel, The way of the LORD is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?
\[30]Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, said the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.
\[31]Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby you have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will you die, O house of Israel?
\[32]For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies, said the Lord GOD: why turn yourselves, and live you.

\[2]And say, What is your mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.
\[3]And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.
\[4]The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt.
\[5]Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.
\[6]And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.
\[7]And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fullness thereof, by the noise of his roaring.
\[8]Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.
\[9]And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel.
\[10]Your mother is like a vine in your blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.
\[11]And she had strong rods for the scepters of them that bore rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.
\[12]But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.
\[13]And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground.
\[14]And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which has devoured her fruit, so that she has no strong rod to be a scepter to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.

nd it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me.
\[2]Then came the word of the LORD to me, saying,
\[3]Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; Are you come to inquire of me? As I live, said the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.
\[4]Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:
\[5]And say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up my hand to them, saying, I am the LORD your God;
\[6]In the day that I lifted up my hand to them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:
\[7]Then said I to them, Cast you away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
\[8]But they rebelled against me, and would not listen to me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the middle of the land of Egypt.
\[9]But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.
\[10]Why I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.
\[11]And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.
\[12]Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.
\[13]But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury on them in the wilderness, to consume them.
\[14]But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.
\[15]Yet also I lifted up my hand to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;
\[16]Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.
\[17]Nevertheless my eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.
\[18]But I said to their children in the wilderness, Walk you not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:
\[19]I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;
\[20]And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.
\[21]Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
\[22]Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.
\[23]I lifted up my hand to them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;
\[24]Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.
\[25]Why I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;
\[26]And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that opens the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD.
\[27]Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
\[28]For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up my hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet smell, and poured out there their drink offerings.
\[29]Then I said to them, What is the high place whereunto you go? And the name whereof is called Bamah to this day.
\[30]Why say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord GOD; Are you polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit you prostitution after their abominations?
\[31]For when you offer your gifts, when you make your sons to pass through the fire, you pollute yourselves with all your idols, even to this day: and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, said the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.
\[32]And that which comes into your mind shall not be at all, that you say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
\[33]As I live, said the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:
\[34]And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein you are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.
\[35]And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.
\[36]Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, said the Lord GOD.
\[37]And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:
\[38]And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[39]As for you, O house of Israel, thus said the Lord GOD; Go you, serve you every one his idols, and hereafter also, if you will not listen to me: but pollute you my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.
\[40]For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, said the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first fruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.
\[41]I will accept you with your sweet smell, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein you have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.
\[42]And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers.
\[43]And there shall you remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein you have been defiled; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have committed.
\[44]And you shall know that I am the LORD when I have worked with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O you house of Israel, said the Lord GOD.
\[45]Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[46]Son of man, set your face toward the south, and drop your word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;
\[47]And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.
\[48]And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.

nd the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and drop your word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,
\[3]And say to the land of Israel, Thus said the LORD; Behold, I am against you, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked.
\[4]Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:
\[5]That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.
\[6]Sigh therefore, you son of man, with the breaking of your loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.
\[7]And it shall be, when they say to you, Why sigh you? that you shall answer, For the tidings; because it comes: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it comes, and shall be brought to pass, said the Lord GOD.
\[8]Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[9]Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus said the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:
\[10]It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it scorns the rod of my son, as every tree.
\[11]And he has given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
\[12]Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be on my people, it shall be on all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be on my people: smite therefore on your thigh.
\[13]Because it is a trial, and what if the sword scorn even the rod?  it shall be no more, said the Lord GOD.
\[14]You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite your hands together. and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which enters into their privy chambers.
\[15]I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.
\[16]Go you one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, wherever your face is set.
\[17]I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said it.
\[18]The word of the LORD came to me again, saying,
\[19]Also, you son of man, appoint you two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both two shall come forth out of one land: and choose you a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.
\[20]Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defended.
\[21]For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.
\[22]At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.
\[23]And it shall be to them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.
\[24]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that you are come to remembrance, you shall be taken with the hand.
\[25]And you, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end,

\[29]Whiles they see vanity to you, whiles they divine a lie to you, to bring you on the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have an end.
\[30]Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge you in the place where you were created, in the land of your nativity.
\[31]And I will pour out my indignation on you, I will blow against you in the fire of my wrath, and deliver you into the hand of brutish men, and skillful to destroy.
\[32]You shall be for fuel to the fire; your blood shall be in the middle of the land; you shall be no more remembered: for I the LORD have spoken it.

oreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[2]Now, you son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? yes, you shall show her all her abominations.
\[3]Then say you, Thus said the Lord GOD, The city sheds blood in the middle of it, that her time may come, and makes idols against herself to defile herself.
\[4]You are become guilty in your blood that you have shed; and have defiled yourself in your idols which you have made; and you have caused your days to draw near, and are come even to your years: therefore have I made you a reproach to the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.
\[5]Those that be near, and those that be far from you, shall mock you, which are infamous and much vexed.
\[6]Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in you to their power to shed blood.
\[7]In you have they set light by father and mother: in the middle of you have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in you have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.
\[8]You have despised my holy things, and have profaned my sabbaths.
\[9]In you are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in you they eat on the mountains: in the middle of you they commit lewdness.
\[10]In you have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in you have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.
\[11]And one has committed abomination with his neighbor's wife; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in you has humbled his sister, his father's daughter.
\[12]In you have they taken gifts to shed blood; you have taken usury and increase, and you have greedily gained of your neighbors by extortion, and have forgotten me, said the Lord GOD.
\[13]Behold, therefore I have smitten my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made, and at your blood which has been in the middle of you.
\[14]Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with you? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.
\[15]And I will scatter you among the heathen, and disperse you in the countries, and will consume your filthiness out of you.
\[16]And you shall take your inheritance in yourself in the sight of the heathen, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[17]And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[18]Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the middle of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.
\[19]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Because you are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the middle of Jerusalem.
\[20]As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the middle of the furnace, to blow the fire on it, to melt it; so will I gather you in my anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.
\[21]Yes, I will gather you, and blow on you in the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in the middle therof.
\[22]As silver is melted in the middle of the furnace, so shall you be melted in the middle thereof; and you shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury on you.
\[23]And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[24]Son of man, say to her, You are the land that is not cleansed, nor rained on in the day of indignation.
\[25]There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the middle thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the middle thereof.
\[26]Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they showed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
\[27]Her princes in the middle thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.
\[28]And her prophets have daubed them with untempered mortar, seeing vanity, and divining lies to them, saying, Thus said the Lord GOD, when the LORD has not spoken.
\[29]The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yes, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.
\[30]And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.
\[31]Therefore have I poured out my indignation on them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed on their heads, said the Lord GOD.

he word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
\[3]And they committed prostitutions in Egypt; they committed prostitutions in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.
\[4]And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bore sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.
\[5]And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors,
\[6]Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.
\[7]Thus she committed her prostitutions with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.
\[8]Neither left she her prostitutions brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their prostitution on her.
\[9]Why I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, on whom she doted.
\[10]These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment on her.
\[11]And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her prostitutions more than her sister in her prostitutions.
\[12]She doted on the Assyrians her neighbors, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.
\[13]Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,
\[14]And that she increased her prostitutions: for when she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,
\[15]Girded with girdles on their loins, exceeding in dyed attire on their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:
\[16]And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted on them, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.
\[17]And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their prostitution, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.
\[18]So she discovered her prostitutions, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.
\[19]Yet she multiplied her prostitutions, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
\[20]For she doted on their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
\[21]Thus you called to remembrance the lewdness of your youth, in bruising your teats by the Egyptians for the breasts of your youth.
\[22]Therefore, O Aholibah, thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up your lovers against you, from whom your mind is alienated, and I will bring them against you on every side;
\[23]The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding on horses.
\[24]And they shall come against you with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against you buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments.
\[25]And I will set my jealousy against you, and they shall deal furiously with you: they shall take away your nose and your ears; and your remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take your sons and your daughters; and your residue shall be devoured by the fire.
\[26]They shall also strip you out of your clothes, and take away your fair jewels.
\[27]Thus will I make your lewdness to cease from you, and your prostitution brought from the land of Egypt: so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.
\[28]For thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate, into the hand of them from whom your mind is alienated:
\[29]And they shall deal with you hatefully, and shall take away all your labor, and shall leave you naked and bore: and the nakedness of your prostitutions shall be discovered, both your lewdness and your prostitutions.
\[30]I will do these things to you, because you have gone a whoring after the heathen, and because you are polluted with their idols.
\[31]You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore will I give her cup into your hand.
\[32]Thus said the Lord GOD; You shall drink of your sister's cup deep and large: you shall be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it contains much.
\[33]You shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of your sister Samaria.
\[34]You shall even drink it and suck it out, and you shall break the shards thereof, and pluck off your own breasts: for I have spoken it, said the Lord GOD.
\[35]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Because you have forgotten me, and cast me behind your back, therefore bear you also your lewdness and your prostitutions.
\[36]The LORD said moreover to me; Son of man, will you judge Aholah and Aholibah? yes, declare to them their abominations;
\[37]That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.
\[38]Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.
\[39]For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, see, thus have they done in the middle of my house.
\[40]And furthermore, that you have sent for men to come from far, to whom a messenger was sent; and, see, they came: for whom you did wash yourself, painted your eyes, and decked yourself with ornaments,
\[41]And sat on a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon you have set my incense and my oil.
\[42]And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads.
\[43]Then said I to her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit prostitutions with her, and she with them?
\[44]Yet they went in to her, as they go in to a woman that plays the harlot: so went they in to Aholah and to Aholibah, the lewd women.
\[45]And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.
\[46]For thus said the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company on them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.
\[47]And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.
\[48]Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.
\[49]And they shall recompense your lewdness on you, and you shall bear the sins of your idols: and you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

\[2]Son of man, write you the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.
\[3]And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:
\[4]Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.
\[5]Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.
\[6]Why thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall on it.
\[7]For her blood is in the middle of her; she set it on the top of a rock; she poured it not on the ground, to cover it with dust;
\[8]That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood on the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.
\[9]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.
\[10]Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.
\[11]Then set it empty on the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.
\[12]She has wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.
\[13]In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged you, and you were not purged, you shall not be purged from your filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest on you.
\[14]I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to your ways, and according to your doings, shall they judge you, said the Lord GOD.
\[15]Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[16]Son of man, behold, I take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke: yet neither shall you mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down.
\[17]Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of your head on you, and put on your shoes on your feet, and cover not your lips, and eat not the bread of men.
\[18]So I spoke to the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
\[19]And the people said to me, Will you not tell us what these things are to us, that you do so?
\[20]Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[21]Speak to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left shall fall by the sword.
\[22]And you shall do as I have done: you shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.
\[23]And your tires shall be on your heads, and your shoes on your feet: you shall not mourn nor weep; but you shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.
\[24]Thus Ezekiel is to you a sign: according to all that he has done shall you do: and when this comes, you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
\[25]Also, you son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,
\[26]That he that escapes in that day shall come to you, to cause you to hear it with your ears?
\[27]In that day shall your mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and you shall speak, and be no more dumb: and you shall be a sign to them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

\[4]Behold, therefore I will deliver you to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in you, and make their dwellings in you: they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.

\[7]Behold, therefore I will stretch out my hand on you, and will deliver you for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut you off from the people, and I will cause you to perish out of the countries: I will destroy you; and you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[8]Thus said the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like to all the heathen;
\[9]Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,
\[10]To the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.
\[11]And I will execute judgments on Moab; and they shall know that I am the LORD.
\[12]Thus said the Lord GOD; Because that Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended, and revenged himself on them;
\[13]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out my hand on Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.
\[14]And I will lay my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, said the Lord GOD.
\[15]Thus said the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old hatred;
\[16]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.

\[6]And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

\[8]He shall slay with the sword your daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against you, and cast a mount against you, and lift up the buckler against you.
\[9]And he shall set engines of war against your walls, and with his axes he shall break down your towers.
\[10]By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover you: your walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into your gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.
\[11]With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all your streets: he shall slay your people by the sword, and your strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.
\[12]And they shall make a spoil of your riches, and make a prey of your merchandise: and they shall break down your walls, and destroy your pleasant houses: and they shall lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the middle of the water.
\[13]And I will cause the noise of your songs to cease; and the sound of your harps shall be no more heard.
\[14]And I will make you like the top of a rock: you shall be a place to spread nets on; you shall be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken it, said the Lord GOD.

\[16]Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit on the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at you.
\[17]And they shall take up a lamentation for you, and say to you, How are you destroyed, that were inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which were strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it!
\[18]Now shall the isles tremble in the day of your fall; yes, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at your departure.
\[19]For thus said the Lord GOD; When I shall make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep on you, and great waters shall cover you;
\[20]When I shall bring you down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set you in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that you be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living;

\[13]You have been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of your tabrets and of your pipes was prepared in you in the day that you were created.
\[14]You are the anointed cherub that covers; and I have set you so: you were on the holy mountain of God; you have walked up and down in the middle of the stones of fire.
\[15]You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, till iniquity was found in you.
\[16]By the multitude of your merchandise they have filled the middle of you with violence, and you have sinned: therefore I will cast you as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy you, O covering cherub, from the middle of the stones of fire.
\[17]Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty, you have corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness: I will cast you to the ground, I will lay you before kings, that they may behold you.
\[18]You have defiled your sanctuaries by the multitude of your iniquities, by the iniquity of your traffic; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the middle of you, it shall devour you, and I will bring you to ashes on the earth in the sight of all them that behold you.
\[19]All they that know you among the people shall be astonished at you: you shall be a terror, and never shall you be any more.
\[20]Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[21]Son of man, set your face against Zidon, and prophesy against it,
\[22]And say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in the middle of you: and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.
\[23]For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the middle of her by the sword on her on every side; and they shall know that I am the LORD.
\[24]And there shall be no more a pricking brier to the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
\[25]Thus said the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.
\[26]And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yes, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments on all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God.

\[3]Speak, and say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the middle of his rivers, which has said, My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.
\[4]But I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales, and I will bring you up out of the middle of your rivers, and all the fish of your rivers shall stick to your scales.
\[5]And I will leave you thrown into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers: you shall fall on the open fields; you shall not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given you for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.
\[6]And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
\[7]When they took hold of you by your hand, you did break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned on you, you brake, and made all their loins to be at a stand.
\[8]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword on you, and cut off man and beast out of you.
\[9]And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am the LORD: because he has said, The river is mine, and I have made it.
\[10]Behold, therefore I am against you, and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of Syene even to the border of Ethiopia.
\[11]No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.
\[12]And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the middle of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
\[13]Yet thus said the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people where they were scattered:
\[14]And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.
\[15]It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.
\[16]And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which brings their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
\[17]And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[18]Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it:
\[19]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.
\[20]I have given him the land of Egypt for his labor with which he served against it, because they worked for me, said the Lord GOD.
\[21]In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give you the opening of the mouth in the middle of them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

\[4]And the sword shall come on Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.
\[5]Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.
\[6]Thus said the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, said the Lord GOD.

\[13]Thus said the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause their images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.
\[14]And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments in No.
\[15]And I will pour my fury on Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.
\[16]And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be rent asunder, and Noph shall have distresses daily.
\[17]The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword: and these cities shall go into captivity.
\[18]At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.

\[23]And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
\[24]And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.

\[2]Son of man, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom are you like in your greatness?
\[3]Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.
\[4]The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little rivers to all the trees of the field.
\[5]Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.
\[6]All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelled all great nations.
\[7]Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.
\[8]The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like to him in his beauty.
\[9]I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.
\[10]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Because you have lifted up yourself in height, and he has shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;
\[11]I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.
\[12]And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: on the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.
\[13]On his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be on his branches:
\[14]To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered to death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the middle of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
\[15]Thus said the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
\[16]I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
\[17]They also went down into hell with him to them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelled under his shadow in the middle of the heathen.
\[18]To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shall you be brought down with the trees of Eden to the nether parts of the earth: you shall lie in the middle of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, said the Lord GOD.

\[3]Thus said the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over you with a company of many people; and they shall bring you up in my net.
\[4]Then will I leave you on the land, I will cast you forth on the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain on you, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with you.
\[5]And I will lay your flesh on the mountains, and fill the valleys with your height.
\[6]I will also water with your blood the land wherein you swim, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of you.

\[8]All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over you, and set darkness on your land, said the Lord GOD.
\[9]I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring your destruction among the nations, into the countries which you have not known.
\[10]Yes, I will make many people amazed at you, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for you, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your fall.

\[23]Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.
\[24]There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.
\[25]They have set her a bed in the middle of the slain with all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the middle of them that be slain.
\[26]There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.

\[2]Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and say to them, When I bring the sword on a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:
\[3]If when he sees the sword come on the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;
\[4]Then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and takes not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be on his own head.
\[5]He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be on him. But he that takes warning shall deliver his soul.
\[6]But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.
\[7]So you, O son of man, I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel; therefore you shall hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.
\[8]When I say to the wicked, O wicked man, you shall surely die; if you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand.
\[9]Nevertheless, if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.
\[10]Therefore, O you son of man, speak to the house of Israel; Thus you speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be on us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?
\[11]Say to them, As I live, said the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn you, turn you from your evil ways; for why will you die, O house of Israel?
\[12]Therefore, you son of man, say to the children of your people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turns from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sins.
\[13]When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he has committed, he shall die for it.
\[14]Again, when I say to the wicked, You shall surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;
\[15]If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.
\[16]None of his sins that he has committed shall be mentioned to him: he has done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
\[17]Yet the children of your people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.
\[18]When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, he shall even die thereby.
\[19]But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.
\[20]Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O you house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.
\[21]And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is smitten.
\[22]Now the hand of the LORD was on me in the evening, before he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.
\[23]Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[24]Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.
\[25]Why say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; You eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall you possess the land?
\[26]You stand on your sword, you work abomination, and you defile every one his neighbor's wife: and shall you possess the land?
\[27]Say you thus to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.
\[28]For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.
\[29]Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.
\[30]Also, you son of man, the children of your people still are talking against you by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that comes forth from the LORD.
\[31]And they come to you as the people comes, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their covetousness.
\[32]And, see, you are to them as a very lovely song of one that has a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear your words, but they do them not.
\[33]And when this comes to pass, (see, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet has been among them.

\[3]You eat the fat, and you clothe you with the wool, you kill them that are fed: but you feed not the flock.
\[4]The diseased have you not strengthened, neither have you healed that which was sick, neither have you bound up that which was broken, neither have you brought again that which was driven away, neither have you sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have you ruled them.
\[5]And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.
\[6]My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill: yes, my flock was scattered on all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them.
\[7]Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;
\[8]As I live, said the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;
\[9]Therefore, O you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;
\[10]Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.
\[11]For thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.
\[12]As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
\[13]And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them on the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
\[14]I will feed them in a good pasture, and on the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed on the mountains of Israel.
\[15]I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, said the Lord GOD.
\[16]I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.
\[17]And as for you, O my flock, thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.
\[18]Seems it a small thing to you to have eaten up the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but you must foul the residue with your feet?
\[19]And as for my flock, they eat that which you have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which you have fouled with your feet.
\[20]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD to them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.
\[21]Because you have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till you have scattered them abroad;
\[22]Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.
\[23]And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
\[24]And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it.
\[25]And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
\[26]And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.
\[27]And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.
\[28]And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.
\[29]And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.
\[30]Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, said the Lord GOD.

\[6]Therefore, as I live, said the Lord GOD, I will prepare you to blood, and blood shall pursue you: since you have not hated blood, even blood shall pursue you.
\[7]Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passes out and him that returns.
\[8]And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in your hills, and in your valleys, and in all your rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.
\[9]I will make you perpetual desolations, and your cities shall not return: and you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[10]Because you have said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there:
\[11]Therefore, as I live, said the Lord GOD, I will even do according to your anger, and according to your envy which you have used out of your hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged you.
\[12]And you shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard all your blasphemies which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.
\[13]Thus with your mouth you have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.
\[14]Thus said the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.
\[15]As you did rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do to you: you shall be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

lso, you son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD:
\[2]Thus said the Lord GOD; Because the enemy has said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession:
\[3]Therefore prophesy and say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that you might be a possession to the residue of the heathen, and you are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are an infamy of the people:
\[4]Therefore, you mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus said the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about;
\[5]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey.
\[6]Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because you have borne the shame of the heathen:
\[7]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; I have lifted up my hand, Surely the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their shame.
\[8]But you, O mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come.
\[9]For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown:
\[10]And I will multiply men on you, all the house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be built:
\[11]And I will multiply on you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better to you than at your beginnings: and you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[12]Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance, and you shall no more from now on bereave them of men.
\[13]Thus said the Lord GOD; Because they say to you, You land devour up men, and have bereaved your nations:
\[14]Therefore you shall devour men no more, neither bereave your nations any more, said the Lord GOD.
\[15]Neither will I cause men to hear in you the shame of the heathen any more, neither shall you bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shall you cause your nations to fall any more, said the Lord GOD.
\[16]Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[17]Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelled in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.
\[18]Why I poured my fury on them for the blood that they had shed on the land, and for their idols with which they had polluted it:
\[19]And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.
\[20]And when they entered to the heathen, where they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.
\[21]But I had pity for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, where they went.
\[22]Therefore say to the house of Israel, thus said the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, which you have profaned among the heathen, where you went.
\[23]And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which you have profaned in the middle of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, said the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
\[24]For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.
\[25]Then will I sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.
\[26]A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.
\[27]And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and you shall keep my judgments, and do them.
\[28]And you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
\[29]I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine on you.
\[30]And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that you shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.
\[31]Then shall you remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.
\[32]Not for your sakes do I this, said the Lord GOD, be it known to you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel.
\[33]Thus said the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be built.
\[34]And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.
\[35]And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited.
\[36]Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.
\[37]Thus said the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.
\[38]As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

he hand of the LORD was on me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the middle of the valley which was full of bones,
\[2]And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, see, they were very dry.
\[3]And he said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, you know.
\[4]Again he said to me, Prophesy on these bones, and say to them, O you dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.
\[5]Thus said the Lord GOD to these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live:
\[6]And I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[7]So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.
\[8]And when I beheld, see, the sinews and the flesh came up on them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.
\[9]Then said he to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus said the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.
\[10]So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet, an exceeding great army.
\[11]Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.
\[12]Therefore prophesy and say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.
\[13]And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,
\[14]And shall put my spirit in you, and you shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall you know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, said the LORD.
\[15]The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
\[16]Moreover, you son of man, take you one stick, and write on it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and for all the house of Israel his companions:
\[17]And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in your hand.
\[18]And when the children of your people shall speak to you, saying, Will you not show us what you mean by these?
\[19]Say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.
\[20]And the sticks where on you write shall be in your hand before their eyes.
\[21]And say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, where they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:
\[22]And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.
\[23]Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
\[24]And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.
\[25]And they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelled; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant David shall be their prince for ever.
\[26]Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the middle of them for ever more.
\[27]My tabernacle also shall be with them: yes, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
\[28]And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the middle of them for ever more.

\[2]Son of man, set your face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
\[3]And say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:
\[4]And I will turn you back, and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you forth, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armor, even a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:
\[5]Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet:
\[6]Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: and many people with you.
\[7]Be you prepared, and prepare for yourself, you, and all your company that are assembled to you, and be you a guard to them.
\[8]After many days you shall be visited: in the latter years you shall come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them.
\[9]You shall ascend and come like a storm, you shall be like a cloud to cover the land, you, and all your bands, and many people with you.
\[10]Thus said the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at the same time shall things come into your mind, and you shall think an evil thought:
\[11]And you shall say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,
\[12]To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn your hand on the desolate places that are now inhabited, and on the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the middle of the land.
\[13]Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say to you, Are you come to take a spoil? have you gathered your company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?
\[14]Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, Thus said the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwells safely, shall you not know it?
\[15]And you shall come from your place out of the north parts, you, and many people with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company, and a mighty army:
\[16]And you shall come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring you against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.
\[17]Thus said the Lord GOD; Are you he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days many years that I would bring you against them?
\[18]And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, said the Lord GOD, that my fury shall come up in my face.
\[19]For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;
\[20]So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep on the earth, and all the men that are on the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.
\[21]And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, said the Lord GOD: every man's sword shall be against his brother.
\[22]And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain on him, and on his bands, and on the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.
\[23]Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the LORD.

herefore, you son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:
\[2]And I will turn you back, and leave but the sixth part of you, and will cause you to come up from the north parts, and will bring you on the mountains of Israel:
\[3]And I will smite your bow out of your left hand, and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand.
\[4]You shall fall on the mountains of Israel, you, and all your bands, and the people that is with you: I will give you to the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.
\[5]You shall fall on the open field: for I have spoken it, said the Lord GOD.
\[6]And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the LORD.
\[7]So will I make my holy name known in the middle of my people Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.
\[8]Behold, it is come, and it is done, said the Lord GOD; this is the day whereof I have spoken.
\[9]And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the hand staves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:
\[10]So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, said the Lord GOD.
\[11]And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give to Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog.
\[12]And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land.
\[13]Yes, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, said the Lord GOD.
\[14]And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain on the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.
\[15]And the passengers that pass through the land, when any sees a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.
\[16]And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land.
\[17]And, you son of man, thus said the Lord GOD; Speak to every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh, and drink blood.
\[18]You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatted calves of Bashan.
\[19]And you shall eat fat till you be full, and drink blood till you be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
\[20]Thus you shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, said the Lord GOD.
\[21]And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid on them.
\[22]So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forward.
\[23]And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword.
\[24]According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done to them, and hid my face from them.
\[25]Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;
\[26]After that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelled safely in their land, and none made them afraid.
\[27]When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;
\[28]Then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them to their own land, and have left none of them any more there.
\[29]Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit on the house of Israel, said the Lord GOD.

n the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was on me, and brought me thither.
\[2]In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me on a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.
\[3]And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.
\[4]And the man said to me, Son of man, behold with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I shall show you; for to the intent that I might show them to you are you brought here: declare all that you see to the house of Israel.
\[5]And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.
\[6]Then came he to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad.
\[7]And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.
\[8]He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.
\[9]Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.
\[10]And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.
\[11]And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
\[12]The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
\[13]He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against door.
\[14]He made also posts of three score cubits, even to the post of the court round about the gate.
\[15]And from the face of the gate of the entrance to the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.
\[16]And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows were round about inward: and on each post were palm trees.
\[17]Then brought he me into the outward court, and, see, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers were on the pavement.
\[18]And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement.
\[19]Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.
\[20]And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.
\[21]And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
\[22]And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after the measure of the gate that looks toward the east; and they went up to it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.
\[23]And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits.
\[24]After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.
\[25]And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
\[26]And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, on the posts thereof.
\[27]And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.
\[28]And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;
\[29]And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
\[30]And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.
\[31]And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were on the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps.
\[32]And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures.
\[33]And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, were according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
\[34]And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm trees were on the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.
\[35]And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according to these measures;
\[36]The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
\[37]And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were on the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.
\[38]And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.
\[39]And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.
\[40]And at the side without, as one goes up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables.
\[41]Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices.
\[42]And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments with which they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
\[43]And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and on the tables was the flesh of the offering.
\[44]And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.
\[45]And he said to me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.
\[46]And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister to him.
\[47]So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.
\[48]And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
\[49]The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.

\[2]And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.
\[3]Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.

\[5]After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.
\[6]And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.
\[7]And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the middle.
\[8]I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.
\[9]The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within.
\[10]And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.
\[11]And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.
\[12]Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.
\[13]So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;
\[14]Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.
\[15]And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;
\[16]The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, paneled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;
\[17]To that above the door, even to the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.
\[18]And it was made with cherubim and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;
\[19]So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about.
\[20]From the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple.
\[21]The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.
\[22]The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said to me, This is the table that is before the LORD.
\[23]And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
\[24]And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.
\[25]And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like as were made on the walls; and there were thick planks on the face of the porch without.
\[26]And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and on the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.

hen he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.
\[2]Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.
\[3]Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.
\[4]And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.
\[5]Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.
\[6]For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.
\[7]And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.
\[8]For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, see, before the temple were an hundred cubits.
\[9]And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goes into them from the utter court.
\[10]The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.
\[11]And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
\[12]And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one enters into them.
\[13]Then said he to me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach to the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.
\[14]When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people.
\[15]Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.
\[16]He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
\[17]He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
\[18]He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.
\[19]He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
\[20]He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.

fterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks toward the east:
\[2]And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.
\[3]And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.
\[4]And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.
\[5]So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.
\[6]And I heard him speaking to me out of the house; and the man stood by me.
\[7]And he said to me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the middle of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their prostitution, nor by the carcasses of their kings in their high places.
\[8]In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: why I have consumed them in my anger.
\[9]Now let them put away their prostitution, and the carcasses of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the middle of them for ever.
\[10]You son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.
\[11]And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, show them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.
\[12]This is the law of the house; On the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.
\[13]And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher place of the altar.
\[14]And from the bottom on the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit.
\[15]So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns.
\[16]And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof.
\[17]And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.
\[18]And he said to me, Son of man, thus said the Lord GOD; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.
\[19]And you shall give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach to me, to minister to me, said the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.
\[20]And you shall take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and on the border round about: thus shall you cleanse and purge it.
\[21]You shall take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.
\[22]And on the second day you shall offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.
\[23]When you have made an end of cleansing it, you shall offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
\[24]And you shall offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt on them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to the LORD.
\[25]Seven days shall you prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.
\[26]Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.
\[27]And when these days are expired, it shall be, that on the eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, said the Lord GOD.

\[2]Then said the LORD to me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.
\[3]It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.
\[4]Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD: and I fell on my face.
\[5]And the LORD said to me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I say to you concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.
\[6]And you shall say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord GOD; O you house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,
\[7]In that you have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.
\[8]And you have not kept the charge of my holy things: but you have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
\[9]Thus said the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel.
\[10]And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.
\[11]Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.
\[12]Because they ministered to them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, said the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.
\[13]And they shall not come near to me, to do the office of a priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.
\[14]But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.
\[15]But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me, and they shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood, said the Lord GOD:
\[16]They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my charge.
\[17]And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come on them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.
\[18]They shall have linen bonnets on their heads, and shall have linen breeches on their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causes sweat.
\[19]And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.
\[20]Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.
\[21]Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.
\[22]Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.
\[23]And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.
\[24]And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.
\[25]And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that has had no husband, they may defile themselves.
\[26]And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon to him seven days.
\[27]And in the day that he goes into the sanctuary, to the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, said the Lord GOD.
\[28]And it shall be to them for an inheritance: I am their inheritance: and you shall give them no possession in Israel: I am their possession.
\[29]They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering: and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.
\[30]And the first of all the first fruits of all things, and every oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the priest's: you shall also give to the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in your house.
\[31]The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.

\[2]Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.
\[3]And of this measure shall you measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place.
\[4]The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister to the LORD: and it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the sanctuary.
\[5]And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.
\[6]And you shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.

\[10]You shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.
\[11]The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.

\[13]This is the oblation that you shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and you shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley:
\[14]Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, you shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer:
\[15]And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, said the Lord GOD.
\[16]All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel.
\[17]And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.
\[18]Thus said the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day of the month, you shall take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary:
\[19]And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it on the posts of the house, and on the four corners of the settle of the altar, and on the posts of the gate of the inner court.

\[3]Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.
\[4]And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer to the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.
\[5]And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.
\[6]And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish.
\[7]And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain to, and an hin of oil to an ephah.
\[8]And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.
\[9]But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that enters in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that enters by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it.
\[10]And the prince in the middle of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.
\[11]And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.
\[12]Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily to the LORD, one shall then open him the gate that looks toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.
\[13]You shall daily prepare a burnt offering to the LORD of a lamb of the first year without blemish: you shall prepare it every morning.
\[14]And you shall prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance to the LORD.
\[15]Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.
\[16]Thus said the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift to any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall be their possession by inheritance.
\[17]But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them.
\[18]Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.

\[21]Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.
\[22]In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure.
\[23]And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about.

\[2]Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without to the utter gate by the way that looks eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.
\[3]And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ankles.
\[4]Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins.
\[5]Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.
\[6]And he said to me, Son of man, have you seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.
\[7]Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
\[8]Then said he to me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.
\[9]And it shall come to pass, that every thing that lives, which moves, wherever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live where the river comes.
\[10]And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand on it from Engedi even to Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.
\[11]But the miry places thereof and the marshes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.
\[12]And by the river on the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.
\[13]Thus said the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby you shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.
\[14]And you shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers: and this land shall fall to you for inheritance.
\[15]And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;
\[16]Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.
\[17]And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this is the north side.
\[18]And the east side you shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border to the east sea. And this is the east side.
\[19]And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south side southward.
\[20]The west side also shall be the great sea from the border, till a man come over against Hamath. This is the west side.
\[21]So shall you divide this land to you according to the tribes of Israel.
\[22]And it shall come to pass, that you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be to you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.

\[8]And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the offering which you shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side to the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it.
\[9]The oblation that you shall offer to the LORD shall be of five and twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in breadth.
\[10]And for them, even for the priests, shall be this holy oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand in length, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the middle thereof.
\[11]It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.
\[12]And this oblation of the land that is offered shall be to them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites.
\[13]And over against the border of the priests the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.
\[14]And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the first fruits of the land: for it is holy to the LORD.
\[15]And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane place for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall be in the middle thereof.
\[16]And these shall be the measures thereof; the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.
\[17]And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty.
\[18]And the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy portion; and the increase thereof shall be for food to them that serve the city.
\[19]And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel.
\[20]All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: you shall offer the holy oblation foursquare, with the possession of the city.
\[21]And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, over against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward over against the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, over against the portions for the prince: and it shall be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the middle thereof.
\[22]Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the middle of that which is the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, shall be for the prince.
\[23]As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side to the west side, Benjamin shall have a portion.
\[24]And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side, Simeon shall have a portion.
\[25]And by the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side, Issachar a portion.
\[26]And by the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side, Zebulun a portion.
\[27]And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side, Gad a portion.
\[28]And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar to the waters of strife in Kadesh, and to the river toward the great sea.
\[29]This is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, said the Lord GOD.
\[30]And these are the goings out of the city on the north side, four thousand and five hundred measures.
\[31]And the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel: three gates northward; one gate of Reuben, one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi.
\[32]And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three gates; and one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate of Dan.
\[33]And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures: and three gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one gate of Zebulun.
\[34]At the west side four thousand and five hundred, with their three gates; one gate of Gad, one gate of Asher, one gate of Naphtali.
\[35]It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.

n the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.
\[2]And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.
\[3]And the king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;
\[4]Children in whom was no blemish, but well favored, and skillful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
\[5]And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.
\[6]Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
\[7]To whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave to Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.
\[8]But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
\[9]Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.
\[10]And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall you make me endanger my head to the king.
\[11]Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
\[12]Prove your servants, I beseech you, ten days; and let them give us vegetables to eat, and water to drink.
\[13]Then let our countenances be looked on before you, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as you see, deal with your servants.
\[14]So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
\[15]And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.
\[16]Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them vegetables.
\[17]As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
\[18]Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
\[19]And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.
\[20]And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.
\[21]And Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus.

nd in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, with which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep broke from him.
\[2]Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to show the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.
\[3]And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.
\[4]Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.
\[5]The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if you will not make known to me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.
\[6]But if you show the dream, and the interpretation thereof, you shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.
\[7]They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it.
\[8]The king answered and said, I know of certainty that you would gain the time, because you see the thing is gone from me.
\[9]But if you will not make known to me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me the interpretation thereof.
\[10]The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man on the earth that can show the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.
\[11]And it is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is none other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.
\[12]For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
\[13]And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.
\[14]Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:
\[15]He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
\[16]Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation.
\[17]Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:
\[18]That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
\[19]Then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
\[20]Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:
\[21]And he changes the times and the seasons: he removes kings, and sets up kings: he gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:
\[22]He reveals the deep and secret things: he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him.
\[23]I thank you, and praise you, O you God of my fathers, who have given me wisdom and might, and have made known to me now what we desired of you: for you have now made known to us the king's matter.
\[24]Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus to him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.
\[25]Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus to him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known to the king the interpretation.
\[26]The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?
\[27]Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king has demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, show to the king;
\[28]But there is a God in heaven that reveals secrets, and makes known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these;
\[29]As for you, O king, your thoughts came into your mind on your bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that reveals secrets makes known to you what shall come to pass.
\[30]But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that you might know the thoughts of your heart.
\[31]You, O king, saw, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before you; and the form thereof was terrible.
\[32]This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,
\[33]His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.
\[34]You saw till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image on his feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.
\[35]Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
\[36]This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.
\[37]You, O king, are a king of kings: for the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.
\[38]And wherever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven has he given into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all. You are this head of gold.
\[39]And after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to you, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.
\[40]And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: for as much as iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things: and as iron that breaks all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.
\[41]And whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, for as much as you saw the iron mixed with miry clay.
\[42]And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.
\[43]And whereas you saw iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not join one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.
\[44]And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
\[45]For as much as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.
\[46]Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors to him.
\[47]The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing you could reveal this secret.
\[48]Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.
\[49]Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.

ebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was three score cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
\[2]Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
\[3]Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
\[4]Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,
\[5]That at what time you hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up:
\[6]And whoever falls not down and worships shall the same hour be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.
\[7]Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
\[8]Why at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.
\[9]They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.
\[10]You, O king, have made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image:
\[11]And whoever falls not down and worships, that he should be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.
\[12]There are certain Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded you: they serve not your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.
\[13]Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.
\[14]Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said to them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not you serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?
\[15]Now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if you worship not, you shall be cast the same hour into the middle of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?
\[16]Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer you in this matter.
\[17]If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.
\[18]But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.
\[19]Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.
\[20]And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
\[21]Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.
\[22]Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
\[23]And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.
\[24]Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spoke, and said to his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the middle of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king.
\[25]He answered and said, See, I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.
\[26]Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spoke, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the most high God, come forth, and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the middle of the fire.
\[27]And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, on whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.
\[28]Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
\[29]Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.
\[30]Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.

ebuchadnezzar the king, to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.
\[2]I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high God has worked toward me.
\[3]How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.
\[4]I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace:
\[5]I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
\[6]Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
\[7]Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me the interpretation thereof.
\[8]But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,
\[9]O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.
\[10]Thus were the visions of my head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the middle of the earth, and the height thereof was great.
\[11]The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached to heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:
\[12]The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelled in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.
\[13]I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;
\[14]He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:
\[15]Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:
\[16]Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given to him; and let seven times pass over him.
\[17]This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will, and sets up over it the basest of men.
\[18]This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now you, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, for as much as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation: but you are able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.
\[19]Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble you. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate you, and the interpretation thereof to your enemies.
\[20]The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;
\[21]Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelled, and on whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:
\[22]It is you, O king, that are grown and become strong: for your greatness is grown, and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the end of the earth.
\[23]And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;
\[24]This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come on my lord the king:
\[25]That they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make you to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet you with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you, till you know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will.
\[26]And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; your kingdom shall be sure to you, after that you shall have known that the heavens do rule.
\[27]Why, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of your tranquility.
\[28]All this came on the king Nebuchadnezzar.
\[29]At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.
\[30]The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?
\[31]While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from you.
\[32]And they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make you to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will.
\[33]The same hour was the thing fulfilled on Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.
\[34]And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honored him that lives for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:
\[35]And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say to him, What do you?
\[36]At the same time my reason returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honor and brightness returned to me; and my counsellors and my lords sought to me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me.
\[37]Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.

elshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.
\[2]Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.
\[3]Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.
\[4]They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
\[5]In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.

\[11]There is a man in your kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar your father, the king, I say, your father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;
\[12]For as much as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.
\[13]Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spoke and said to Daniel, Are you that Daniel, which are of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?
\[14]I have even heard of you, that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in you.
\[15]And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof: but they could not show the interpretation of the thing:
\[16]And I have heard of you, that you can make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if you can read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, you shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about your neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\[17]Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let your gifts be to yourself, and give your rewards to another; yet I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
\[18]O you king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honor:
\[19]And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.
\[20]But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:
\[21]And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appoints over it whomsoever he will.
\[22]And you his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this;
\[23]But have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you, and your lords, your wives, and your concubines, have drunk wine in them; and you have praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all your ways, have you not glorified:
\[24]Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.
\[25]And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
\[26]This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God has numbered your kingdom, and finished it.
\[27]TEKEL; You are weighed in the balances, and are found wanting.
\[28]PERES; Your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
\[29]Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\[30]In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.
\[31]And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about three score and two years old.

t pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;
\[2]And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts to them, and the king should have no damage.
\[3]Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
\[4]Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; for as much as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.
\[5]Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.
\[6]Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus to him, King Darius, live for ever.
\[7]All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of you, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
\[8]Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which alters not.
\[9]Why king Darius signed the writing and the decree.
\[10]Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.
\[11]Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.
\[12]Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king's decree; Have you not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which alters not.
\[13]Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regards not you, O king, nor the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.
\[14]Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him.
\[15]Then these men assembled to the king, and said to the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed.
\[16]Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said to Daniel, Your God whom you serve continually, he will deliver you.
\[17]And a stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.
\[18]Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep went from him.
\[19]Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions.
\[20]And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice to Daniel: and the king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from the lions?
\[21]Then said Daniel to the king, O king, live for ever.
\[22]My God has sent his angel, and has shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: for as much as before him innocence was found in me; and also before you, O king, have I done no hurt.
\[23]Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found on him, because he believed in his God.
\[24]And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.
\[25]Then king Darius wrote to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.
\[26]I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and steadfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even to the end.
\[27]He delivers and rescues, and he works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
\[28]So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

n the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.
\[2]Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove on the great sea.
\[3]And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
\[4]The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand on the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.
\[5]And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh.
\[6]After this I beheld, and see another, like a leopard, which had on the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
\[7]After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
\[8]I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.
\[9]I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.
\[10]A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
\[11]I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.
\[12]As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.
\[13]I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
\[14]And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.
\[15]I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the middle of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.
\[16]I came near to one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.
\[17]These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.
\[18]But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
\[19]Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;
\[20]And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.
\[21]I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
\[22]Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
\[23]Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
\[24]And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.
\[25]And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.
\[26]But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end.
\[27]And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
\[28]Till now is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.

n the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, even to me Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.
\[2]And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.
\[3]Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
\[4]I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.
\[5]And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.
\[6]And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran to him in the fury of his power.
\[7]And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped on him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
\[8]Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.
\[9]And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.
\[10]And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped on them.
\[11]Yes, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary was cast down.
\[12]And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practiced, and prospered.
\[13]Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said to that certain saint which spoke, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
\[14]And he said to me, To two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
\[15]And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.
\[16]And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.
\[17]So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.
\[18]Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.
\[19]And he said, Behold, I will make you know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.
\[20]The ram which you saw having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.
\[21]And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.
\[22]Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.
\[23]And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.
\[24]And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practice, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.
\[25]And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
\[26]And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: why shut you up the vision; for it shall be for many days.
\[27]And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.

n the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;
\[2]In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.
\[3]And I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:
\[4]And I prayed to the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;
\[5]We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from your precepts and from your judgments:
\[6]Neither have we listened to your servants the prophets, which spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
\[7]O LORD, righteousness belongs to you, but to us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries where you have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against you.
\[8]O Lord, to us belongs confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you.
\[9]To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;
\[10]Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
\[11]Yes, all Israel have transgressed your law, even by departing, that they might not obey your voice; therefore the curse is poured on us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.
\[12]And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing on us a great evil: for under the whole heaven has not been done as has been done on Jerusalem.
\[13]As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come on us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand your truth.
\[14]Therefore has the LORD watched on the evil, and brought it on us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he does: for we obeyed not his voice.
\[15]And now, O Lord our God, that have brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have gotten you renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
\[16]O LORD, according to all your righteousness, I beseech you, let your anger and your fury be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people are become a reproach to all that are about us.
\[17]Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of your servant, and his supplications, and cause your face to shine on your sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.
\[18]O my God, incline your ear, and hear; open your eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by your name: for we do not present our supplications before you for our righteousnesses, but for your great mercies.
\[19]O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, listen and do; defer not, for your own sake, O my God: for your city and your people are called by your name.
\[20]And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;
\[21]Yes, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.
\[22]And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give you skill and understanding.
\[23]At the beginning of your supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to show you; for you are greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.
\[24]Seventy weeks are determined on your people and on your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.
\[25]Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.
\[26]And after three score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and to the end of the war desolations are determined.
\[27]And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured on the desolate.

n the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.
\[2]In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.
\[3]I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.
\[4]And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;
\[5]Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:
\[6]His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.
\[7]And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell on them, so that they fled to hide themselves.
\[8]Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.
\[9]Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.
\[10]And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands.
\[11]And he said to me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright: for to you am I now sent.  And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling.
\[12]Then said he to me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that you did set your heart to understand, and to chasten yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I am come for your words.
\[13]But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, see, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.
\[14]Now I am come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.
\[15]And when he had spoken such words to me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.
\[16]And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned on me, and I have retained no strength.
\[17]For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.
\[18]Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,
\[19]And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be to you, be strong, yes, be strong. And when he had spoken to me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for you have strengthened me.
\[20]Then said he, Know you why I come to you? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, see, the prince of Grecia shall come.
\[21]But I will show you that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holds with me in these things, but Michael your prince.

lso I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.
\[2]And now will I show you the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.
\[3]And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.
\[4]And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.
\[5]And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.
\[6]And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.
\[7]But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:
\[8]And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.
\[9]So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.
\[10]But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.
\[11]And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.
\[12]And when he has taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.
\[13]For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.
\[14]And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of your people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.
\[15]So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.
\[16]But he that comes against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.
\[17]He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.
\[18]After this shall he turn his face to the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn on him.
\[19]Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.
\[20]Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.
\[21]And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.

\[23]And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.
\[24]He shall enter peaceably even on the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yes, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.
\[25]And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.
\[26]Yes, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.
\[27]And both of these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.
\[28]Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land.
\[29]At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.
\[30]For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.
\[31]And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that makes desolate.
\[32]And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.
\[33]And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days.
\[34]Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help: but many shall join to them with flatteries.
\[35]And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.
\[36]And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.
\[37]Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.
\[38]But in his estate shall he honor the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.
\[39]Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.
\[40]And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.
\[41]He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.
\[42]He shall stretch forth his hand also on the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
\[43]But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.
\[44]But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.

he word of the LORD that came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
\[2]The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take to you a wife of prostitutions and children of prostitutions: for the land has committed great prostitution, departing from the LORD.
\[3]So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bore him a son.
\[4]And the LORD said to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.
\[5]And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.
\[6]And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And God said to him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy on the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.
\[7]But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.
\[8]Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son.
\[9]Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.
\[10]Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, there it shall be said to them, You are the sons of the living God.
\[11]Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.

\[2]Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her prostitutions out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;
\[3]Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.
\[4]And I will not have mercy on her children; for they be the children of prostitutions.
\[5]For their mother has played the harlot: she that conceived them has done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.
\[6]Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.
\[7]And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.
\[8]For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.
\[9]Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.
\[10]And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.
\[11]I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.
\[12]And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she has said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
\[13]And I will visit on her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgot me, said the LORD.
\[14]Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably to her.
\[15]And I will give her her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
\[16]And it shall be at that day, said the LORD, that you shall call me Ishi; and shall call me no more Baali.
\[17]For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.
\[18]And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.
\[19]And I will betroth you to me for ever; yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving kindness, and in mercies.
\[20]I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness: and you shall know the LORD.
\[21]And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, said the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;
\[22]And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.
\[23]And I will sow her to me in the earth; and I will have mercy on her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, You are my people; and they shall say, You are my God.

\[3]Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwells therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yes, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
\[4]Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for your people are as they that strive with the priest.
\[5]Therefore shall you fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with you in the night, and I will destroy your mother.
\[6]My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you, that you shall be no priest to me: seeing you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your children.
\[7]As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.
\[8]They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.
\[9]And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.
\[10]For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit prostitution, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.
\[11]Prostitution and wine and new wine take away the heart.
\[12]My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declares to them: for the spirit of prostitutions has caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.
\[13]They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit prostitution, and your spouses shall commit adultery.
\[14]I will not punish your daughters when they commit prostitution, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that does not understand shall fall.
\[15]Though you, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not you to Gilgal, neither go you up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD lives.
\[16]For Israel slides back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.
\[17]Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.

\[7]He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loves to oppress.
\[8]And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: in all my labors they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin.
\[9]And I that am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt will yet make you to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.
\[10]I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.
\[11]Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yes, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields.
\[12]And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.
\[13]And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.
\[14]Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood on him, and his reproach shall his LORD return to him.

\[2]And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.
\[3]Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that passes away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.
\[4]Yet I am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt, and you shall know no god but me: for there is no savior beside me.

\[10]I will be your king: where is any other that may save you in all your cities? and your judges of whom you said, Give me a king and princes?
\[11]I gave you a king in my anger, and took him away in my wrath.
\[12]The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.
\[13]The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come on him: he is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children.

\[15]Though he be fruitful among his brothers, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.

\[3]Tell you your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation.

\[5]Awake, you drunkards, and weep; and howl, all you drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.
\[6]For a nation is come up on my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he has the cheek teeth of a great lion.
\[7]He has laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he has made it clean bore, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.
\[8]Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
\[9]The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn.
\[10]The field is wasted, the land mourns; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languishes.
\[11]Be you ashamed, O you farmers; howl, O you vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.
\[12]The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languishes; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.
\[13]Gird yourselves, and lament, you priests: howl, you ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withheld from the house of your God.
\[14]Sanctify you a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God, and cry to the LORD,
\[15]Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.
\[16]Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yes, joy and gladness from the house of our God?
\[17]The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.
\[18]How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
\[19]O LORD, to you will I cry: for the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame has burned all the trees of the field.

\[2]A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread on the mountains: a great people and a strong; there has not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations.
\[3]A fire devours before them; and behind them a flame burns: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yes, and nothing shall escape them.
\[4]The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.
\[5]Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.
\[6]Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.
\[7]They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks:
\[8]Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and when they fall on the sword, they shall not be wounded.
\[9]They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run on the wall, they shall climb up on the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.
\[10]The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:
\[11]And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executes his word: for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?
\[12]Therefore also now, said the LORD, turn you even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:
\[13]And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn to the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repents him of the evil.
\[14]Who knows if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering to the LORD your God?
\[15]Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:
\[16]Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.
\[17]Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare your people, O LORD, and give not your heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: why should they say among the people, Where is their God?
\[18]Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people.
\[19]Yes, the LORD will answer and say to his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and you shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen:
\[20]But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill smell shall come up, because he has done great things.
\[21]Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things.
\[22]Be not afraid, you beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree bears her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength.
\[23]Be glad then, you children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he has given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.
\[24]And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.
\[25]And I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.
\[26]And you shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that has dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.
\[27]And you shall know that I am in the middle of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.
\[28]And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:
\[29]And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.
\[30]And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
\[31]The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.

\[12]Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.
\[13]Put you in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great.
\[14]Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.

\[16]The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.
\[17]So shall you know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.
\[18]And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.
\[19]Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
\[20]But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.

\[2]And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.
\[3]Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:
\[4]But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.
\[5]I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holds the scepter from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir, said the LORD.
\[6]Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:
\[7]But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof:
\[8]And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holds the scepter from Ashkelon, and I will turn my hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, said the Lord GOD.

\[10]But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the palaces thereof.

\[4]For thus said the LORD to the house of Israel, Seek you me, and you shall live:
\[5]But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nothing.
\[6]Seek the LORD, and you shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.
\[7]You who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,
\[8]Seek him that makes the seven stars and Orion, and turns the shadow of death into the morning, and makes the day dark with night: that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:
\[9]That strengthens the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.
\[10]They hate him that rebukes in the gate, and they abhor him that speaks uprightly.
\[11]For as much therefore as your treading is on the poor, and you take from him burdens of wheat: you have built houses of hewn stone, but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted pleasant vineyards, but you shall not drink wine of them.
\[12]For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.
\[13]Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.
\[14]Seek good, and not evil, that you may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as you have spoken.
\[15]Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.
\[16]Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, said thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas!  and they shall call the farmer to mourning, and such as are skillful of lamentation to wailing.
\[17]And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through you, said the LORD.
\[18]Woe to you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.
\[19]As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.
\[20]Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?
\[21]I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.
\[22]Though you offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.
\[23]Take you away from me the noise of your songs; for I will not hear the melody of your viols.
\[24]But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
\[25]Have you offered to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?
\[26]But you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.

\[10]And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burns him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say to him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with you? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold your tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.
\[11]For, behold, the LORD commands, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.
\[12]Shall horses run on the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for you have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:
\[13]You which rejoice in a thing of nothing, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?
\[14]But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, said the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath to the river of the wilderness.

\[2]And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech you: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.
\[3]The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, said the LORD.
\[4]Thus has the Lord GOD showed to me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.
\[5]Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech you: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.
\[6]The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, said the Lord GOD.
\[7]Thus he showed me: and, behold, the LORD stood on a wall made by a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.
\[8]And the LORD said to me, Amos, what see you? And I said, A plumb line. Then said the LORD, Behold, I will set a plumb line in the middle of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:
\[9]And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
\[10]Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against you in the middle of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.
\[11]For thus Amos said, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.
\[12]Also Amaziah said to Amos, O you seer, go, flee you away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:
\[13]But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court.
\[14]Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdsman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:
\[15]And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said to me, Go, prophesy to my people Israel.
\[16]Now therefore hear you the word of the LORD: You say, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not your word against the house of Isaac.
\[17]Therefore thus said the LORD; Your wife shall be an harlot in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by line; and you shall die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.

\[2]And he said, Amos, what see you? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the LORD to me, The end is come on my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.
\[3]And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, said the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.
\[4]Hear this, O you that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,
\[5]Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?
\[6]That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yes, and sell the refuse of the wheat?
\[7]The LORD has sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.
\[8]Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwells therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.
\[9]And it shall come to pass in that day, said the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day:
\[10]And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.
\[11]Behold, the days come, said the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:
\[12]And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.
\[13]In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.

\[2]Though they dig into hell, there shall my hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, there will I bring them down:
\[3]And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out there; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:
\[4]And though they go into captivity before their enemies, there will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set my eyes on them for evil, and not for good.

\[12]That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, said the LORD that does this.

\[3]The pride of your heart has deceived you, you that dwell in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that said in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?
\[4]Though you exalt yourself as the eagle, and though you set your nest among the stars, there will I bring you down, said the LORD.
\[5]If thieves came to you, if robbers by night, (how are you cut off!)  would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave some grapes?
\[6]How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up!
\[7]All the men of your confederacy have brought you even to the border: the men that were at peace with you have deceived you, and prevailed against you; that they eat your bread have laid a wound under you: there is none understanding in him.
\[8]Shall I not in that day, said the LORD, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?
\[9]And your mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.
\[10]For your violence against your brother Jacob shame shall cover you, and you shall be cut off for ever.
\[11]In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots on Jerusalem, even you were as one of them.
\[12]But you should not have looked on the day of your brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither should you have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither should you have spoken proudly in the day of distress.
\[13]You should not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yes, you should not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;
\[14]Neither should you have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither should you have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.
\[15]For the day of the LORD is near on all the heathen: as you have done, it shall be done to you: your reward shall return on your own head.
\[16]For as you have drunk on my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yes, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.
\[17]But on mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.
\[18]And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD has spoken it.
\[19]And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.
\[20]And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites, even to Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south.

\[2]Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.
\[3]But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.
\[4]But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.
\[5]Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man to his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.
\[6]So the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, What mean you, O sleeper? arise, call on your God, if so be that God will think on us, that we perish not.
\[7]And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is on us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.
\[8]Then said they to him, Tell us, we pray you, for whose cause this evil is on us; What is your occupation? and from where come you? what is your country? and of what people are you?
\[9]And he said to them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which has made the sea and the dry land.
\[10]Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said to him. Why have you done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.
\[11]Then said they to him, What shall we do to you, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea worked, and was tempestuous.
\[12]And he said to them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm to you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is on you.
\[13]Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea worked, and was tempestuous against them.

\[4]Then I said, I am cast out of your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.
\[5]The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.
\[6]I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet have you brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.
\[7]When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in to you, into your holy temple.

\[3]Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech you, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.

\[10]And it shall come to pass in that day, said the LORD, that I will cut off your horses out of the middle of you, and I will destroy your chariots:
\[11]And I will cut off the cities of your land, and throw down all your strong holds:
\[12]And I will cut off witchcrafts out of your hand; and you shall have no more soothsayers:
\[13]Your graven images also will I cut off, and your standing images out of the middle of you; and you shall no more worship the work of your hands.

\[3]O my people, what have I done to you? and wherein have I wearied you? testify against me.
\[4]For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of servants; and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

\[7]Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

\[14]You shall eat, but not be satisfied; and your casting down shall be in the middle of you; and you shall take hold, but shall not deliver; and that which you deliver will I give up to the sword.
\[15]You shall sow, but you shall not reap; you shall tread the olives, but you shall not anoint you with oil; and sweet wine, but shall not drink wine.

\[2]The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.
\[3]That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asks, and the judge asks for a reward; and the great man, he utters his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.
\[4]The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge: the day of your watchmen and your visitation comes; now shall be their perplexity.
\[5]Trust you not in a friend, put you not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of your mouth from her that lies in your bosom.
\[6]For the son dishonors the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.
\[7]Therefore I will look to the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.
\[8]Rejoice not against me, O my enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light to me.
\[9]I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.
\[10]Then she that is my enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said to me, Where is the LORD your God? my eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.

\[13]Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.
\[14]Feed your people with your rod, the flock of your heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the middle of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
\[15]According to the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt will I show to him marvelous things.
\[16]The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay their hand on their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.
\[17]They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of you.
\[18]Who is a God like to you, that pardons iniquity, and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retains not his anger for ever, because he delights in mercy.
\[19]He will turn again, he will have compassion on us; he will subdue our iniquities; and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
\[20]You will perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.

\[3]The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: the LORD has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.
\[4]He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers: Bashan languishes, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languishes.
\[5]The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yes, the world, and all that dwell therein.
\[6]Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.
\[7]The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knows them that trust in him.
\[8]But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.
\[9]What do you imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.
\[10]For while they be entwined together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.
\[11]There is one come out of you, that imagines evil against the LORD, a wicked counselor.
\[12]Thus said the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.
\[13]For now will I break his yoke from off you, and will burst your bonds in sunder.
\[14]And the LORD has given a commandment concerning you, that no more of your name be sown: out of the house of your gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make your grave; for you are vile.
\[15]Behold on the mountains the feet of him that brings good tidings, that publishes peace! O Judah, keep your solemn feasts, perform your vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through you; he is utterly cut off.

\[3]Why do you show me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.
\[4]Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment does never go forth: for the wicked does compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceeds.
\[5]Behold you among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which you will not believe, though it be told you.
\[6]For, see, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwelling places that are not their's.

\[8]Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hastens to eat.

\[5]Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.
\[6]He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.
\[7]I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
\[8]Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was your anger against the rivers? was your wrath against the sea, that you did ride on your horses and your chariots of salvation?
\[9]Your bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even your word. Selah. You did split the earth with rivers.
\[10]The mountains saw you, and they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.
\[11]The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of your arrows they went, and at the shining of your glittering spear.
\[12]You did march through the land in indignation, you did thresh the heathen in anger.
\[13]You went forth for the salvation of your people, even for salvation with your anointed; you wounded the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation to the neck. Selah.
\[14]You did strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.
\[15]You did walk through the sea with your horses, through the heap of great waters.
\[16]When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he comes up to the people, he will invade them with his troops.
\[17]Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:
\[18]Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.

\[17]And I will bring distress on men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.

\[14]Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
\[15]The LORD has taken away your judgments, he has cast out your enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the middle of you: you shall not see evil any more.
\[16]In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear you not: and to Zion, Let not your hands be slack.
\[17]The LORD your God in the middle of you is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over you with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over you with singing.
\[18]I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of you, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.
\[19]Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict you: and I will save her that halts, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.
\[20]At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, said the LORD.

n the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,
\[2]Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD's house should be built.
\[3]Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,
\[4]Is it time for you, O you, to dwell in your paneled houses, and this house lie waste?
\[5]Now therefore thus said the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.
\[6]You have sown much, and bring in little; you eat, but you have not enough; you drink, but you are not filled with drink; you clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earns wages earns wages to put it into a bag with holes.
\[7]Thus said the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.
\[8]Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, said the LORD.
\[9]You looked for much, and, see it came to little; and when you brought it home, I did blow on it. Why? said the LORD of hosts. Because of my house that is waste, and you run every man to his own house.
\[10]Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.
\[11]And I called for a drought on the land, and on the mountains, and on the corn, and on the new wine, and on the oil, and on that which the ground brings forth, and on men, and on cattle, and on all the labor of the hands.
\[12]Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD.
\[13]Then spoke Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message to the people, saying, I am with you, said the LORD.
\[14]And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,

\[2]Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,
\[3]Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do you see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?
\[4]Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, said the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all you people of the land, said the LORD, and work: for I am with you, said the LORD of hosts:
\[5]According to the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, so my spirit remains among you: fear you not.
\[6]For thus said the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;
\[7]And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, said the LORD of hosts.
\[8]The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, said the LORD of hosts.
\[9]The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, said the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, said the LORD of hosts.
\[10]In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,
\[11]Thus said the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,
\[12]If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
\[13]Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.
\[14]Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, said the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.
\[15]And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid on a stone in the temple of the LORD:
\[16]Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the fat press for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.
\[17]I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labors of your hands; yet you turned not to me, said the LORD.
\[18]Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider it.
\[19]Is the seed yet in the barn? yes, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, has not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.
\[20]And again the word of the LORD came to Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,
\[21]Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;
\[22]And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.
\[23]In that day, said the LORD of hosts, will I take you, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, said the LORD, and will make you as a signet: for I have chosen you, said the LORD of hosts.

\[3]Therefore say you to them, Thus said the LORD of hosts; Turn you to me, said the LORD of hosts, and I will turn to you, said the LORD of hosts.
\[4]Be you not as your fathers, to whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; Turn you now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor listen to me, said the LORD.
\[5]Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?
\[6]But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so has he dealt with us.
\[7]On the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,
\[8]I saw by night, and behold a man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.
\[9]Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said to me, I will show you what these be.
\[10]And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.
\[11]And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits still, and is at rest.
\[12]Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these three score and ten years?
\[13]And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words.
\[14]So the angel that communed with me said to me, Cry you, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.
\[15]And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.
\[16]Therefore thus said the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, said the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth on Jerusalem.
\[17]Cry yet, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
\[18]Then lifted I up my eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.
\[19]And I said to the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
\[20]And the LORD showed me four carpenters.
\[21]Then said I, What come these to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.

\[8]For thus said the LORD of hosts; After the glory has he sent me to the nations which spoiled you: for he that touches you touches the apple of his eye.
\[9]For, behold, I will shake my hand on them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me.

\[8]Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you, and your fellows that sit before you: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.

\[6]And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy on them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God, and will hear them.
\[7]And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yes, their children shall see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.
\[8]I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased.
\[9]And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.
\[10]I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them.

pen your doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour your cedars.
\[2]Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O you oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.
\[3]There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.
\[4]Thus said the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;
\[5]Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.
\[6]For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, said the LORD: but, see, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbor's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.
\[7]And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock. And I took to me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.
\[8]Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me.
\[9]Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dies, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.
\[10]And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.
\[11]And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited on me knew that it was the word of the LORD.
\[12]And I said to them, If you think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.
\[13]And the LORD said to me, Cast it to the potter: a goodly price that I was priced at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.
\[14]Then I cut asunder my other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
\[15]And the LORD said to me, Take to you yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.
\[16]For, see, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that stands still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.
\[17]Woe to the idol shepherd that leaves the flock! the sword shall be on his arm, and on his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.

\[2]Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling to all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.
\[3]And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.
\[4]In that day, said the LORD, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open my eyes on the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness.
\[5]And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God.
\[6]In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem.
\[7]The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah.
\[8]In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the LORD before them.
\[9]And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
\[10]And I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look on me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.
\[11]In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.
\[12]And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;
\[13]The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;

\[3]And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say to him, You shall not live; for you speak lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesies.
\[4]And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he has prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:
\[5]But he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an farmer; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.

\[9]And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.

ehold, the day of the LORD comes, and your spoil shall be divided in the middle of you.
\[2]For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
\[3]Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.
\[4]And his feet shall stand in that day on the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall split in the middle thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.
\[5]And you shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal: yes, you shall flee, like as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with you.
\[6]And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark:
\[7]But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light.
\[8]And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.
\[9]And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one.
\[10]All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.
\[11]And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.
\[12]And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand on their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.
\[13]And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.
\[14]And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.
\[15]And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.
\[16]And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.
\[17]And it shall be, that whoever will not come up of all the families of the earth to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, even on them shall be no rain.
\[18]And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no rain; there shall be the plague, with which the LORD will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
\[19]This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
\[20]In that day shall there be on the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD's house shall be like the bowls before the altar.
\[21]Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness to the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.

\[2]I have loved you, said the LORD. Yet you say, Wherein have you loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? said the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,
\[3]And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.
\[4]Whereas Edom said, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus said the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD has indignation for ever.
\[5]And your eyes shall see, and you shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.
\[6]A son honors his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is my honor? and if I be a master, where is my fear? said the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, that despise my name. And you say, Wherein have we despised your name?
\[7]You offer polluted bread on my altar; and you say, Wherein have we polluted you? In that you say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.
\[8]And if you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now to your governor; will he be pleased with you, or accept your person? said the LORD of hosts.
\[9]And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious to us: this has been by your means: will he regard your persons? said the LORD of hosts.
\[10]Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nothing? neither do you kindle fire on my altar for nothing. I have no pleasure in you, said the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.
\[11]For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, said the LORD of hosts.
\[12]But you have profaned it, in that you say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.
\[13]You said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and you have snuffed at it, said the LORD of hosts; and you brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus you brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? said the LORD.
\[14]But cursed be the deceiver, which has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the LORD a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, said the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.

nd now, O you priests, this commandment is for you.
\[2]If you will not hear, and if you will not lay it to heart, to give glory to my name, said the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse on you, and I will curse your blessings: yes, I have cursed them already, because you do not lay it to heart.
\[3]Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung on your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it.
\[4]And you shall know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant might be with Levi, said the LORD of hosts.
\[5]My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear with which he feared me, and was afraid before my name.
\[6]The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.
\[7]For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.
\[8]But you are departed out of the way; you have caused many to stumble at the law; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi, said the LORD of hosts.
\[9]Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as you have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.
\[10]Have we not all one father? has not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?
\[11]Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and has married the daughter of a strange god.
\[12]The LORD will cut off the man that does this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offers an offering to the LORD of hosts.
\[13]And this have you done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, so that he regards not the offering any more, or receives it with good will at your hand.
\[14]Yet you say, Why? Because the LORD has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously: yet is she your companion, and the wife of your covenant.
\[15]And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And why one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
\[16]For the LORD, the God of Israel, said that he hates putting away: for one covers violence with his garment, said the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that you deal not treacherously.
\[17]You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you say, Wherein have we wearied him? When you say, Every one that does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delights in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?

ehold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts.
\[2]But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appears? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:
\[3]And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer to the LORD an offering in righteousness.
\[4]Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant to the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.
\[5]And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, said the LORD of hosts.
\[6]For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed.
\[7]Even from the days of your fathers you are gone away from my ordinances, and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, said the LORD of hosts. But you said, Wherein shall we return?
\[8]Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed me. But you say, Wherein have we robbed you? In tithes and offerings.
\[9]You are cursed with a curse: for you have robbed me, even this whole nation.
\[10]Bring you all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in my house, and prove me now herewith, said the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.
\[11]And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, said the LORD of hosts.
\[12]And all nations shall call you blessed: for you shall be a delightsome land, said the LORD of hosts.
\[13]Your words have been stout against me, said the LORD. Yet you say, What have we spoken so much against you?
\[14]You have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?
\[15]And now we call the proud happy; yes, they that work wickedness are set up; yes, they that tempt God are even delivered.
\[16]Then they that feared the LORD spoke often one to another: and the LORD listened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought on his name.
\[17]And they shall be mine, said the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son that serves him.
\[18]Then shall you return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serves God and him that serves him not.
