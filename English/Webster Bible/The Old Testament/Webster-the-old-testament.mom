n the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
\[2]And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness [was] upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
\[3]And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
\[4]And God saw the light, that [it was] good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
\[5]And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night: and the evening and the morning were the first day.
\[6]And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
\[7]And God made the firmament; and divided the waters which [were] under the firmament from the waters which [were] above the firmament: and it was so.
\[8]And God called the firmament Heaven: and the evening and the morning were the second day.
\[9]And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered into one place, and let the dry [land] appear: and it was so.
\[10]And God called the dry [land] Earth, and the collection of waters he called Seas: and God saw that it [was] good.
\[11]And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, [and] the fruit-tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed [is] in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
\[12]And the earth brought forth grass, [and] herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed [was] in itself, after its kind: and God saw that it [was] good.
\[13]And the evening and the morning were the third day.
\[14]And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night: and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years.
\[15]And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
\[16]And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also.
\[17]And God set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth.
\[18]And to rule over the day, and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it [was] good.
\[19]And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
\[20]And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl [that] may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
\[21]And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.
\[22]And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
\[23]And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
\[24]And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and the creeping animal, and the beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
\[25]And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every animal that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.
\[26]And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth.
\[27]So God created man in his [own] image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
\[28]And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living animal that moveth upon the earth.
\[29]And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which [is] the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.
\[30]And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every animal that creepeth upon the earth, in which [is] life, [I have given] every green herb for food: and it was so.
\[31]And God saw every thing that he had made, and behold, [it was] very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

hus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
\[2]And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
\[3]And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
\[4]These [are] the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.
\[5]And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and [there was] not a man to till the ground.
\[6]But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
\[7]And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
\[8]And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
\[9]And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
\[10]And a river went out of Eden to water the garden: and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
\[11]The name of the first [is] Pison, which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where [there is] gold;
\[12]And the gold of that land [is] good: there [is] bdellium and the onyx-stone.
\[13]And the name of the second river [is] Gihon: the same that compasseth the whole land of Cush.
\[14]And the name of the third river [is] Hiddekel: which floweth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river [is] Euphrates.
\[15]And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it.
\[16]And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
\[17]But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt surely die.
\[18]And the LORD God said, [It is] not good that the man should be alone: I will make him a help meet for him.
\[19]And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought [them] to Adam to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that [was] its name.
\[20]And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowls of the air, and to every beast of the field: but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him.
\[21]And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.
\[22]And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, he made woman, and brought her to the man.
\[23]And Adam said, This [is] now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man.
\[24]Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
\[25]And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

ow the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made: and he said to the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
\[2]And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
\[3]But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
\[4]And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
\[5]For God doth know, that in the day ye eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened: and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
\[6]And when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for food, and that it [was] pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make [one] wise; she took of its fruit, and ate, and gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.
\[7]And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they [were] naked: and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made for themselves aprons.
\[8]And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
\[9]And the LORD God called to Adam, and said to him, Where [art] thou?
\[10]And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden: and I was afraid, because I [was] naked; and I hid myself.
\[11]And he said, Who told thee that thou [wast] naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, that thou shouldest not eat?
\[12]And the man said, The woman, whom thou gavest [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.
\[13]And the LORD God said to the woman, What [is] this [that] thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.
\[14]And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou [art] cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field: upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
\[15]And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
\[16]To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children: and thy desire [shall be] to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
\[17]And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed [is] the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat [of] it all the days of thy life;
\[18]Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
\[19]In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou shalt return to the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou [art], and to dust shalt thou return.
\[20]And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
\[21]For Adam also and for his wife the LORD God made coats of skins, and clothed them.
\[22]And the LORD God said, Behold, the man hath become as one of us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
\[23]Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
\[24]So he drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

\[2]And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
\[3]And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD.
\[4]And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect to Abel, and to his offering:
\[5]But to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
\[6]And the LORD said to Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
\[7]If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And to thee [shall be] his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
\[8]And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
\[9]And the LORD said to Cain, Where [is] Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: [Am] I my brother's keeper?
\[10]And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the ground.
\[11]And now [art] thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;
\[12]When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield to thee its strength: A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
\[13]And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment [is] greater than I can bear.
\[14]Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it will come to pass, [that] every one that findeth me will slay me.
\[15]And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him seven-fold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
\[16]And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
\[17]And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son Enoch.
\[18]And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
\[19]And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one [was] Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
\[20]And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and [of such as have] cattle.
\[21]And his brother's name [was] Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
\[22]And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain [was] Naamah.
\[23]And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
\[24]If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold, truly Lamech seventy and seven-fold.
\[25]And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: For God, [said she], hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.

\[3]And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also [is] flesh: yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.
\[4]There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore [children] to them: the same [became] mighty men, who [were] of old, men of renown.

\[6]And the LORD repented that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
\[7]And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created, from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and the creeping animal, and the fowls of the air; for I repent that I have made them.

\[13]And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them: and behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
\[14]Make thee an ark of gopher-wood: rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
\[15]And this [is the fashion] in which thou shalt make it: the length of the ark [shall be] three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the hight of it thirty cubits.
\[16]A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in its side: [with] lower, second, and third [stories] shalt thou make it.
\[17]And behold, I, even I do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, in which [is] the breath of life, from under heaven: [and] every thing that [is] on the earth shall die.

\[18]And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth: and the ark moved upon the face of the waters.
\[19]And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills that [were] under the whole heaven were covered.
\[20]Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail: and the mountains were covered.
\[21]And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
\[22]All in whose nostrils [was] the breath of life, of all that [was] on the dry [land], died.

\[19]Every beast, every creeping animal, and every fowl, [and] whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went out of the ark.
\[20]And Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.
\[21]And the LORD smelled a sweet savor; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart [is] evil from his youth: neither will I again smite any more every living animal as I have done.

\[13]I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
\[14]And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:
\[15]And I will remember my covenant, which [is] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

\[19]These three [were] the sons of Noah: and from them was the whole earth overspread.
\[20]And Noah began [to be] a husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
\[21]And he drank the wine, and was drunken, and he was uncovered within his tent.
\[22]And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
\[23]And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father: and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
\[24]And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done to him.
\[25]And he said, Cursed [be] Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren.
\[26]And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

\[7]Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.

\[3]And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

\[6]And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite [was] then in the land.
\[7]And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To thy seed will I give this land: and there he erected an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.
\[8]And he removed from thence to a mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, [having] Beth-el on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he erected an altar to the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.
\[9]And Abram journeyed, going on still towards the south.
\[10]And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to dwell there; for the famine [was] grievous in the land.
\[11]And it came to pass, when he had come near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou [art] a fair woman to look upon:

\[13]Say, I pray thee, thou [art] my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
\[14]And it came to pass, that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she [was] very fair.
\[15]The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

\[17]And the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
\[18]And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What [is] this [that] thou hast done to me? why didst thou not tell me that she [is] thy wife?
\[19]Why saidst thou, She [is] my sister? so I might have taken her to me for a wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take [her], and go thy way.

\[5]And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
\[6]And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
\[7]And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.
\[8]And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we [are] brethren.
\[9][Is] not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if [thou wilt take] the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if [thou wilt depart] to the right hand, then I will go to the left.

\[11]Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
\[12]Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched [his] tent towards Sodom.
\[13]But the men of Sodom [were] wicked, and sinners before the LORD, exceedingly.
\[14]And the LORD said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:
\[15]For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
\[16]And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, [then] shall thy seed also be numbered.
\[17]Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to thee.

\[13]And the LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I certainly bear a child, who am old?
\[14]Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return to thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
\[15]Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
\[16]And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
\[17]And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;
\[18]Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
\[19]For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they will keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
\[20]And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
\[21]I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know.
\[22]And the men turned their faces from thence, and went towards Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.
\[23]And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
\[24]Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that [are] in it?
\[25]That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
\[26]And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
\[27]And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I, who [am] dust and ashes, have taken upon me to speak to the Lord.
\[28]Peradventure there will lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for [lack of] five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy [it].
\[29]And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Peradventure there will be forty found there. And he said, I will not do [it] for forty's sake.
\[30]And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there will thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do [it], if I find thirty there.
\[31]And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the Lord: Peradventure there will be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for twenty's sake.
\[32]And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten will be found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for ten's sake.
\[33]And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.

nd there came two angels to Sodom at evening; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom; and Lot seeing [them], rose to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face towards the ground;
\[2]And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
\[3]And he urged them greatly; and they turned in to him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
\[4]But before they lay down, the men of the city, [even] the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
\[5]And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where [are] the men who came in to thee this night? bring them out to us, that we may know them.
\[6]And Lot went out at the door to them, and shut the door after him,
\[7]And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
\[8]Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do ye to them as [is] good in your eyes: only to these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
\[9]And they said, Stand back. And they said [again], This one [man] came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: Now will we deal worse with thee than with them. And they pressed hard upon the man, Lot, and came near to break the door.
\[10]But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.
\[11]And they smote the men that [were] at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
\[12]And the men said to Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatever thou hast in the city, bring [them] out of this place:
\[13]For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them has become great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.
\[14]And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Arise, depart from this place; for the LORD will destroy this city: but he seemed to his sons-in-law as one that mocked.
\[15]And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters who are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
\[16]And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters: the LORD being merciful to him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
\[17]And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life: look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain: escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
\[18]And Lot said to them, Oh, not so, my Lord!
\[19]Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shown to me in saving my life: and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil should take me, and I die:
\[20]Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it [is] a small one: Oh, let me escape thither! ([Is] it not a small one?) and my soul shall live.
\[21]And he said to him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for which thou hast spoken.
\[22]Haste thee, escape thither: for I cannot do any thing till thou hast come thither: therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
\[23]The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
\[24]Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
\[25]And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
\[26]But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
\[27]And Abraham rose early in the morning, to the place were he stood before the LORD:
\[28]And he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah, and towards all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
\[29]And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.
\[30]And Lot went up from Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he, and his two daughters.
\[31]And the first-born said to the younger, Our father [is] old, and [there is] not a man on the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth:
\[32]Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
\[33]And they made their father drink wine that night: and the first-born went in and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
\[34]And it came to pass on the morrow that the first born said to the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father; let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, [and] lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
\[35]And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
\[36]Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
\[37]And the first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab: the same [is] the father of the Moabites to this day.
\[38]And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same [is] the father of the children of Ammon to this day.

nd Abraham journeyed from thence towards the south country, and dwelt between Kadash and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
\[2]And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, she is my sister: And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
\[3]But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou [art but] a dead man, on account of the woman whom thou hast taken: for she [is] a man's wife.
\[4]But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou also slay a righteous nation?
\[5]Said he not to me, She [is] my sister? and she, even she herself said, He [is] my brother: in the integrity of my heart, and innocence of my hands have I done this.
\[6]And God said to him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore I suffered thee not to touch her.
\[7]Now therefore restore to the man [his] wife, for he [is] a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou shalt not restore [her], know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that [are] thine.
\[8]Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were greatly afraid.
\[9]Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What has thou done to us? and in what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds to me that ought not to be done.
\[10]And Abimelech said to Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
\[11]And Abraham said, Because I thought, surely the fear of God [is] not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.
\[12]And yet indeed [she is] my sister: she [is] the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
\[13]And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This [is] thy kindness which thou shalt show to me; At every place whither we shall come, say of me, He [is] my brother.
\[14]And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and women-servants, and gave [them] to Abraham, and restored to him Sarah his wife.
\[15]And Abimelech said, Behold, my land [is] before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.
\[16]And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand [pieces] of silver: behold, he [is] to thee a covering of the eyes, to all that [are] with thee, and with all [other]: thus she was reproved.
\[17]So Abraham prayed to God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants, and they bore [children].
\[18]For the LORD had made barren all the females of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.

nd the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had spoken.
\[2]For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
\[3]And Abraham called the name of his son that was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
\[4]And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
\[5]And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born to him.
\[6]And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, [so that] all that hear will laugh with me.
\[7]And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah shall nurse children? for I have borne him a son in his old age.
\[8]And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the day that Isaac was weaned.
\[9]And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne to Abraham, mocking.
\[10]Wherefore, she said to Abraham, Cast out this bond-woman, and her son: for the son of this bond-woman shall not be heir with my son, [even] with Isaac.
\[11]And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight, because of his son.
\[12]And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight, because of the lad, and because of thy bond-woman; in all that Sarah hath said to thee, hearken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
\[13]And also of the son of the bond-woman will I make a nation, because he [is] thy seed.
\[14]And Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave [it] to Hagar (putting [it] on her shoulder) and the child, and sent her away; and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
\[15]And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
\[16]And she went, and sat her down over against [him], a good way off, as it were a bow-shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against [him], and raised her voice, and wept.
\[17]And God heard the voice of the lad: and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he [is].
\[18]Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand: for I will make him a great nation.
\[19]And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water: and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
\[20]And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
\[21]And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took for him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
\[22]And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, spoke to Abraham, saying, God [is] with thee in all that thou doest:
\[23]Now therefore swear to me here by God, that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: [but] according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land in which thou hast sojourned.
\[24]And Abraham said, I will swear.
\[25]And Abraham reproved Abimelech, because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
\[26]And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet have I heard [of it], but to-day.
\[27]And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a covenant.
\[28]And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves.
\[29]And Abimelech said to Abraham, What [mean] these seven ewe-lambs, which thou hast set by themselves?
\[30]And he said, For [these] seven ewe-lambs shalt thou take from my hand, that they may be a witness to me, that I have digged this well.
\[31]Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba: because there they swore both of them.
\[32]Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: Then Abimelech arose, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
\[33]And [Abraham] planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.

\[2]And he said, Take now thy son, thy only [son] Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will name to thee.
\[3]And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and cleft the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose and went to the place which God had named to him.
\[4]Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
\[5]And Abraham said to his young men, Abide you here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and return to you.
\[6]And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid [it] upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife: and they went both of them together.
\[7]And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, here [am] I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where [is] the lamb for a burnt-offering?
\[8]And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt-offering: so they went both of them together.
\[9]And they came to the place which God had named to him; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order; and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
\[10]And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
\[11]And the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here [am] I.
\[12]And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing to him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld from me thy son, thy only [son].
\[13]And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind [him] a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.
\[14]And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said [to] this day, In the mount of the LORD it will be seen.
\[15]And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven the second time,
\[16]And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thy only [son]:
\[17]That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which [is] on the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
\[18]And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed: because thou hast obeyed my voice.
\[19]So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.
\[20]And it came to pass after these things, that it was told to Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also borne children to thy brother Nahor;
\[21]Huz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
\[22]And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

\[3]And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,
\[4]I [am] a stranger and a sojourner with you; give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
\[5]And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,
\[6]Hear us, my lord; thou [art] a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchers bury thy dead: none of us will withhold from thee his sepulcher, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.
\[7]And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children of Heth.

\[9]That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which [is] in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me, for a possession of a burying-place among you.

\[11]Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I to thee, and the cave that [is] in it, I give it to thee; in the presence of the sons of my people I give it to thee: bury thy dead.
\[12]And Abraham bowed himself before the people of the land.
\[13]And he spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou [wilt give it], I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field: take [it] of me, and I will bury my dead there.
\[14]And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
\[15]My lord, hearken to me: the land [is worth] four hundred shekels of silver; what [is] that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
\[16]And Abraham hearkened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current [money] with the merchant.

\[18]To Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that entered the gate of his city.

\[4]But thou shalt go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.
\[5]And the servant said to him, It may be the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land: must I needs bring thy son again to the land from whence thou camest?
\[6]And Abraham said to him, Beware that thou bring not my son thither again.
\[7]The LORD God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To thy seed I will give this land: he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence.
\[8]And if the woman shall not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath; only bring not my son thither again.
\[9]And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that matter.
\[10]And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed; (for all the goods of his master [were] in his hands:) and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.
\[11]And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water, at the time of the evening, the time when women go out to draw [water]:
\[12]And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, prosper me this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.
\[13]Behold, I stand [here] by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:
\[14]And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: [let the same be] she [that] thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and by that shall I know that thou hast shown kindness to my master.

\[17]And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water from thy pitcher.
\[18]And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
\[19]And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw [water] for thy camels also, till they have done drinking.
\[20]And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw [water], and drew for all his camels.
\[21]And the man, wondering at her, held his peace, to know whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous, or not.
\[22]And it came to pass as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ear-ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten [shekels] weight of gold;
\[23]And said, Whose daughter [art] thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room [in] thy father's house for us to lodge in?
\[24]And she said to him, I [am] the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.
\[25]She said moreover to him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
\[26]And the man bowed his head, and worshipped the LORD.
\[27]And he said, Blessed [be] the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left my master destitute of his mercy and his truth: I [being] in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.
\[28]And the damsel ran, and told these things to her mother's house.
\[29]And Rebekah had a brother, and his name [was] Laban: and Laban ran out to the man, to the well.

\[31]And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; why standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
\[32]And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that [were] with him.

\[38]But thou shalt go to my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.
\[39]And I said to my master, It may be the woman will not follow me.
\[40]And he said to me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house.
\[41]Then shalt thou be clear from [this] my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee [one], thou shalt be clear from my oath.
\[42]And I came this day to the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou dost prosper my way which I go:
\[43]Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw [water], and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;
\[44]And she saith to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: [let] the same [be] the woman whom the LORD hath pointed out for my master's son.
\[45]And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well, and drew [water]: and I said to her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
\[46]And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her [shoulder], and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
\[47]And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter [art] thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him: and I put the ear-ring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.
\[48]And I bowed my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son.
\[49]And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
\[50]Then Laban and Bethuel answered, and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak to thee bad or good.
\[51]Behold, Rebekah [is] before thee, take [her], and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.
\[52]And it came to pass, that when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, [bowing himself] to the earth.
\[53]And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave [them] to Rebekah: He gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
\[54]And they ate and drank, he and the men that [were] with him, and tarried all night; and they rose in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.
\[55]And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us [a few] days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.
\[56]And he said to them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way: send me away, that I may go to my master.
\[57]And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.
\[58]And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
\[59]And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.
\[60]And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Thou [art] our sister, be thou [the mother] of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those who hate them.
\[61]And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
\[62]And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.
\[63]And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at evening: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and behold, the camels [were] coming.
\[64]And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel.
\[65]For she [had] said to the servant, What man [is] this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant [had] said, It [is] my master: therefore she took a vail and covered herself.
\[66]And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
\[67]And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's [death].

\[2]And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
\[3]And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim and Leummim.
\[4]And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these [were] the children of Keturah.
\[5]And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.
\[6]But to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son (while he yet lived) eastward, to the east country.
\[7]And these [are] the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred and seventy five years.
\[8]Then Abraham expired, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full [of years]; and was gathered to his people.
\[9]And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which [is] before Mamre;
\[10]The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
\[11]And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac: and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.
\[12]Now these [are] the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham.
\[13]And these [are] the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The first-born of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
\[14]And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
\[15]Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
\[16]These [are] the sons of Ishmael, and these [are] their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
\[17]And these [are] the years of the life of Ishmael; a hundred and thirty and seven years: and he expired and died, and was gathered to his people.
\[18]And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, that [is] before Egypt, as thou goest towards Assyria: [and] he died in the presence of all his brethren.
\[19]And these [are] the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:
\[20]And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
\[21]And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she [was] barren: and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
\[22]And the children struggled together within her: and she said, If [it is] so, why [am] I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD.
\[23]And the LORD said to her, Two nations [are] in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels: and [the one] people shall be stronger than [the other] people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
\[24]And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, [there were] twins in her womb.
\[25]And the first was born red, all over like a hairy garment: and they called his name Esau.
\[26]And after that his brother was born, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac [was] sixty years old when she bore them.
\[27]And the boys grew: and Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob [was] a plain man dwelling in tents.
\[28]And Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of [his] venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
\[29]And Jacob boiled pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he [was] faint.
\[30]And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red [pottage]; for I [am] faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
\[31]And Jacob said, Sell to me this day thy birth-right.
\[32]And Esau said, Behold, I [am] at the point to die: and what profit shall this birth-right bring to me?
\[33]And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore to him: and he sold his birth-right to Jacob.
\[34]Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way: thus Esau despised [his] birth-right.

nd there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.
\[2]And the LORD appeared to him, and said, Go not down into Egypt: dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.
\[3]Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: for to thee, and to thy seed I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father;
\[4]And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give to thy seed all these countries: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed:
\[5]Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
\[6]And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
\[7]And the men of the place asked [him] of his wife; and he said, She [is] my sister: for he feared to say, [She is] my wife; lest, [said he], the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she [was] fair to look upon.
\[8]And it came to pass when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and behold, Isaac [was] sporting with Rebekah his wife.
\[9]And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, surely she [is] thy wife: and how saidst thou, She [is] my sister? and Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I should die on her account.
\[10]And Abimelech said, What [is] this thou hast done to us? one of the people might lightly have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldst have brought guiltiness upon us.
\[11]And Abimelech charged all [his] people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
\[12]Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundred-fold: and the LORD blessed him:
\[13]And the man became great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:
\[14]For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and very many servants: And the Philistines envied him.
\[15]For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
\[16]And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us: for thou art much mightier than we.
\[17]And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
\[18]And Isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
\[19]And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
\[20]And the herdmen of Gerar contended with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water [is] ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.
\[21]And they digged another well, and contended for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.
\[22]And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they did not contend: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
\[23]And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
\[24]And the LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, I [am] the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I [am] with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.
\[25]And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.
\[26]Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.
\[27]And Isaac said to them, Why come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
\[28]And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, [even] betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
\[29]That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done to thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou [art] now the blessed of the LORD.
\[30]And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
\[31]And they rose betimes in the morning, and swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
\[32]And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said to him, We have found water.
\[33]And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city [is] Beer-sheba to this day.
\[34]And Esau was forty years old when he took for a wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:

\[2]And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:
\[3]Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me [some] venison;
\[4]And make me savory meat, such as I love, and bring [it] to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.
\[5]And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son; and Esau went to the field to hunt [for] venison, [and] to bring it.
\[6]And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak to Esau thy brother, saying,
\[7]Bring me venison, and make me savory meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD, before my death.
\[8]Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, according to that which I command thee.
\[9]Go now to the flock, and bring me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savory meat for thy father, such as he loveth:
\[10]And thou shalt bring [it] to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.
\[11]And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother [is] a hairy man, and I [am] a smooth man:
\[12]My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
\[13]And his mother said to him, upon me [be] thy curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me.
\[14]And he went, and took, and brought [them] to his mother: and his mother made savory meat, such as his father loved.
\[15]And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which was with her in the house, and put it upon Jacob her younger son:
\[16]And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth part of his neck:
\[17]And she gave the savory meat, and the bread which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
\[18]And he came to his father, and said, My father: And he said, Here [am] I; who [art] thou, my son?
\[19]And Jacob said to his father, I [am] Esau thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
\[20]And Isaac said to his son, How [is it] that thou hast found [it] so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought [it] to me.
\[21]And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou [art] my very son Esau, or not.
\[22]And Jacob went near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice [is] Jacob's voice, but the hands [are] the hands of Esau.
\[23]And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: So he blessed him.
\[24]And he said, [Art] thou my very son Esau? And he said, I [am].
\[25]And he said, bring [it] near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought [it] near to him, and he ate: and he brought him wine, and he drank.
\[26]And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
\[27]And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son [is] as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:
\[28]Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:
\[29]Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee; be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed [be] every one that curseth thee, and blessed [be] he that blesseth thee.
\[30]And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had yet scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
\[31]And he also had made savory meat, and brought it to his father; and said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.
\[32]And Isaac his father said to him, Who [art] thou? And he said, I [am] thy son, thy first-born Esau.
\[33]And Isaac trembled exceedingly, and said, Who? where [is] he that hath taken venison, and brought [it] me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, [and] he shall be blessed.
\[34]And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceedingly bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, [even] me also, O my father.
\[35]And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.
\[36]And he said, Is he not rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me twice: he took away my birth-right; and behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
\[37]And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now to thee, my son?
\[38]And Esau said to his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, [even] me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
\[39]And Isaac his father answered, and said to him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;
\[40]And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother: and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.
\[41]And Esau hated Jacob, because of the blessing with which his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.
\[42]And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as concerning thee, doth comfort himself, [purposing] to kill thee.
\[43]Now therefore, my son, obey my voice: and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;
\[44]And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury shall turn away;
\[45]Till thy brother's anger shall turn away from thee, and he shall forget [that] which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and bring thee from thence. Why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?
\[46]And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life, because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob shall take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these [who are] of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?

\[5]And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
\[6]When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him, he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;

\[11]And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set: and he took of the stones of that place, and put [them for] his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.
\[12]And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder set upon the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
\[13]And behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I [am] the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land on which thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.
\[14]And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.

\[17]And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful [is] this place! this [is] no other but the house of God, and this [is] the gate of heaven.

\[21]So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:

\[3]And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place.

\[13]And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.
\[14]And Reuben went, in the days of wheat-harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.
\[15]And she said to her, [Is it] a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes.
\[16]And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in to me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
\[17]And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob the fifth son.
\[18]And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.
\[19]And Leah conceived again, and bore Jacob the sixth son.
\[20]And Leah said, God hath endowed me [with] a good dower; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.
\[21]And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
\[22]And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and rendered her fruitful.
\[23]And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:
\[24]And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD will add to me another son.
\[25]And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.
\[26]Give [me] my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.
\[27]And Laban said to him, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine eyes, [tarry: for] I have learned by experience, that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.
\[28]And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give [it].
\[29]And he said to him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle were with me.
\[30]For [it was] little which thou hadst before I [came], and it is [now] increased to a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for my own house also?
\[31]And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed [and] keep thy flock:
\[32]I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and [of such] shall be my hire.
\[33]So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that [is] not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be accounted stolen with me.
\[34]And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.
\[35]And he removed that day the he-goats that were ring-streaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted; every one that had [some] white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave [them] into the hands of his sons.
\[36]And he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
\[37]And Jacob took to him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut-tree; and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which [was] in the rods.
\[38]And he set the rods, which he had peeled, before the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs, when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.
\[39]And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted.
\[40]And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks towards the ring-streaked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban: and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not with Laban's cattle.
\[41]And it came to pass, whenever the stronger cattle conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
\[42]But when the cattle were feeble, he put [them] not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
\[43]And the man increased exceedingly, and had many cattle, and maid-servants, and men-servants, and camels, and asses.

nd he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that [was] our father's; and of [that] which [was] our father's hath he obtained all this glory.
\[2]And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and behold, it [was] not towards him as before.
\[3]And the LORD said to Jacob, Return to the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
\[4]And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field to his flock,
\[5]And said to them, I see your father's countenance, that it [is] not towards me as before: but the God of my father hath been with me.
\[6]And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
\[7]And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times: but God suffered him not to hurt me.
\[8]If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bore speckled: and if he said thus, The ring-streaked shall be thy hire; then all the cattle bore ring-streaked.
\[9]Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given [them] to me.
\[10]And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle [were] ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled.
\[11]And the angel of God spoke to me in a dream, [saying], Jacob: And I said, Here [am] I.
\[12]And he said, Lift up now thy eyes and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle [are] ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth to thee.
\[13]I [am] the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst the pillar, [and] where thou vowedst to me a vow: now arise, depart from this land, and return to the land of thy kindred.
\[14]And Rachel and Leah answered, and said to him, [Is there] yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
\[15]Are we not counted by him strangers; for he hath sold us, and hath quite consumed also our money.
\[16]For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that [is] ours, and our children's: now then whatever God hath said to thee, do.
\[17]Then Jacob arose, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
\[18]And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gained, the cattle of his getting, which he had gained in Padan-aram; to go to Isaac, his father, in the land of Canaan.
\[19]And Laban went to shear his sheep; and Rachel had stolen the images that [were] her father's.
\[20]And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he was about to depart.
\[21]So he fled with all that he had; and he arose, and passed over the river, and set his face [towards] the mount Gilead.
\[22]And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.
\[23]And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey: and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.
\[24]And God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream by night, and said to him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
\[25]Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban, with his brethren, pitched in the mount of Gilead.
\[26]And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives [taken] with the sword?
\[27]Why didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
\[28]And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons, and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in [so] doing.
\[29]It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spoke to me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
\[30]And now, [though] thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou didst earnestly long after thy father's house; [yet] why hast thou stolen my gods?
\[31]And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, It may be thou wouldest take thy daughters from me by force.
\[32]With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what [is] thine with me, and take [it] to thee: for Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
\[33]And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maid-servants' tents; but he found [them] not. Then he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
\[34]Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found [them] not.
\[35]And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women [is] upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.
\[36]And Jacob was wroth, and chid with Laban: and Jacob answered, and said to Laban, What [is] my trespass? what [is] my sin, that thou hast so eagerly pursued after me?
\[37]Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household-stuff? set [it] here before my brethren, and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.
\[38]These twenty years [have] I [been] with thee: thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.
\[39]That which was torn by beasts, I brought not to thee; I bore the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, [whether] stolen by day, or stolen by night.
\[40][Thus] I was; in the day the drouth consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from my eyes.
\[41]Thus have I been twenty years in thy house: I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
\[42]Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac had been with me, surely thou hadst now sent me away empty. God hath seen my affliction, and the labor of my hands, and rebuked [thee] yesternight.
\[43]And Laban answered, and said to Jacob, [These] daughters [are] my daughters, and [these] children [are] my children, and [these] cattle [are] my cattle, and all that thou seest [is] mine; and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children which they have borne?
\[44]Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
\[45]And Jacob took a stone, and set it up [for] a pillar.
\[46]And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they ate there upon the heap.
\[47]And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed:
\[48]And Laban said, This heap [is] a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:
\[49]And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
\[50]If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take [other] wives besides my daughters; no man [is] with us; See, God [is] witness betwixt me and thee.
\[51]And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold [this] pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;
\[52]This heap [be] witness, and [this] pillar [be] witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
\[53]The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.
\[54]Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they ate bread, and tarried all night in the mount.
\[55]And early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned to his place.

\[2]And when Jacob saw them, he said, This [is] God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
\[3]And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, to the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
\[4]And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau: Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there till now:
\[5]And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and men-servants, and women-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.
\[6]And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he is coming to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
\[7]Then Jacob was greatly afraid, and distressed: and he divided the people that [were] with him, and the flocks, and herds, and camels, into two bands;
\[8]And said, If Esau shall come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left, will escape.
\[9]And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD who saidst to me, Return to thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee;
\[10]I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shown to thy servant: for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands.
\[11]Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he shall come and smite me, [and] the mother with the children.
\[12]And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
\[13]And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau, his brother;
\[14]Two hundred she-goats, and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
\[15]Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.
\[16]And he delivered [them] into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
\[17]And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau, my brother, meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose [art] thou? and whither goest thou? and whose [are] these before thee?
\[18]Then thou shalt say, They [are] thy servant Jacob's: it [is] a present sent to my lord Esau: and behold also he [is] behind us.
\[19]And so he commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, In this manner shall ye speak to Esau, when ye find him.
\[20]And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob [is] behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.
\[21]So the present went over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the company.
\[22]And he arose that night, and took his two wives, and his two women-servants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.
\[23]And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that which he had.
\[24]And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him, until the breaking of the day.
\[25]And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh: and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
\[26]And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh; And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
\[27]And he said to him, What [is] thy name? And he said, Jacob.
\[28]And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God, and with men, and hast prevailed.
\[29]And Jacob asked [him], and said, Tell [me], I pray thee, thy name: And he said, why [is] it [that] thou dost ask after my name? and he blessed him there.
\[30]And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
\[31]And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
\[32]Therefore the children of Israel eat not [of] the sinew which shrunk, which [is] upon the hollow of the thigh, to this day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrunk.

\[2]And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.
\[3]And he passed on before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, till he came near to his brother.
\[4]And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
\[5]And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children, and said, Who [are] those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given to thy servant.
\[6]Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
\[7]And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves; and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
\[8]And he said, What [meanest] thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, [these are] to find grace in the sight of my lord.
\[9]And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep what thou hast to thyself.
\[10]And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou hast been pleased with me.
\[11]Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough: and he urged him, and he took [it].
\[12]And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
\[13]And he said to him, My lord knoweth that the children [are] tender, and the flocks and herds with young [are] with me, and if men should over-drive them one day, all the flock will die.
\[14]Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on slowly, according as the cattle that go before me, and the children are able to endure; until I come to my lord to Seir.
\[15]And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee [some] of the people that [are] with me: And he said, What needeth it? Let me find grace in the sight of my lord.
\[16]So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
\[17]And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
\[18]And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which [is] in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city.
\[19]And he bought a part of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money.

\[3]And his soul cleaved to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke kindly to the damsel.
\[4]And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel for a wife.
\[5]And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter (now his sons were with his cattle in the field:) and Jacob held his peace till they had come.
\[6]And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to commune with him.
\[7]And the sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard [it]: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel, in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
\[8]And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her to him for a wife.
\[9]And make ye marriages with us: give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to you.
\[10]And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
\[11]And Shechem said to her father, and to her brethren, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say to me, I will give.
\[12]Ask me never so much dower and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say to me: but give me the damsel for a wife.
\[13]And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, (because he had defiled Dinah their sister,)
\[14]And they said to them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised: for that [would be] a reproach to us:
\[15]But in this will we consent to you: If ye will be as we [are], that every male of you shall be circumcised;
\[16]Then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
\[17]But if ye will not hearken to us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
\[18]And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.
\[19]And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he [was] more honorable than all the house of his father.
\[20]And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
\[21]These men [are] peaceable with us, therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein: for the land, behold, [it is] large enough for them: let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
\[22]Only herein, will the men consent to us to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us shall be circumcised, as they [are] circumcised.
\[23][Will] not their cattle, and their substance, and every beast of theirs [be] ours? only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.
\[24]And to Hamor and to Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city: and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
\[25]And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.
\[26]And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.
\[27]The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city; because they had defiled their sister.
\[28]They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which [was] in the city, and that which [was] in the field.
\[29]And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives they took captive, and spoiled even all that [was] in the house.
\[30]And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites, and the Perizzites: and I [being] few in number, they will assemble themselves against me, and slay me, and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.

\[3]And let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.

nd Jacob dwelt in the land in which his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.
\[2]These [are] the generations of Jacob. Joseph [being] seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, and the lad [was] with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought to his father their evil report.
\[3]Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he [was] the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of [many] colors.
\[4]And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.
\[5]And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told [it] to his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.
\[6]And he said to them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
\[7]For behold, we [were] binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves stood around and made obeisance to my sheaf.
\[8]And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words.
\[9]And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more: and behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.
\[10]And he told [it] to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said to him, what [is] this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
\[11]And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
\[12]And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
\[13]And Israel said to Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed [the flock] in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee to them. And he said to him, Here [am I].
\[14]And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him from the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
\[15]And a certain man found him, and behold [he was] wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
\[16]And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed [their flocks].
\[17]And the man said, They have departed hence: for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren and found them in Dothan.
\[18]And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near to them, they conspired against him to slay him.
\[19]And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer is coming.
\[20]Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit; and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him; and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
\[21]And Reuben heard [it], and he delivered him from their hands: and said, Let us not kill him.
\[22]And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that [is] in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might deliver him from their hands, to bring him back to his father.
\[23]And it came to pass when Joseph had come to his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, [his] coat of [many] colors that [was] on him.
\[24]And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit [was] empty; [there was] no water in it.
\[25]And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery, and balm, and myrrh, going to carry [them] down to Egypt.
\[26]And Judah said to his brethren, What profit [is it] if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood.
\[27]Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he [is] our brother, our flesh: and his brethren were content.
\[28]Then there passed by Midianites, merchants; and they drew and lifted Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty [pieces] of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
\[29]And Reuben returned to the pit; and behold, Joseph [was] not in the pit: and he rent his clothes.
\[30]And he returned to his brethren, and said, The child [is] not: and I, whither shall I go?
\[31]And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood:
\[32]And they sent the coat of [many] colors, and they brought [it] to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it [is] thy son's coat or not.
\[33]And he knew it, and said, [It is] my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him: Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
\[34]And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
\[35]And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave to my son mourning: Thus his father wept for him.
\[36]And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, [and] captain of the guard.

nd it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name [was] Hirah.
\[2]And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name [was] Shuah; and he took her, and went in to her.
\[3]And she conceived, and bore a son; and he called his name Er.
\[4]And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she called his name Onan.
\[5]And she yet again conceived, and bore a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.
\[6]And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, whose name [was] Tamar.
\[7]And Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.
\[8]And Judah said to Onan, Go in to thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
\[9]And Onan knew that the seed would not be his: and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he frustrated the purpose, lest he should give seed to his brother.
\[10]And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.
\[11]Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son shall be grown; (for he said, Lest perhaps he die also as his brethren [did]:) and Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
\[12]And in process of time, the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died: and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep-shearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
\[13]And it was told to Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnath, to shear his sheep.
\[14]And she put off from her, her widow's garments, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which [is] by the way to Timnath: for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him for a wife.
\[15]When Judah saw her, he thought her [to be] a harlot; because she had covered her face.
\[16]And he turned to her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me have access to thee; (for he knew not that she [was] his daughter-in-law:) and she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayst have access to me?
\[17]And he said, I will send [thee] a kid from the flock: and she said, Wilt thou give [me] a pledge, till thou sendest [it]?
\[18]And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? and she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that [is] in thy hand: and he gave [them to] her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.
\[19]And she arose and went her way and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
\[20]And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive [his] pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.
\[21]Then he asked the men of that place, saying, where [is] the harlot that [was] openly by the way-side? and they said, There was no harlot in this [place].
\[22]And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, [that] there was no harlot in this [place].
\[23]And Judah said, Let her take [it] to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
\[24]And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told to Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and also, behold she [is] with child by lewdness: and Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
\[25]When she [was] brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man whose these [are], am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose [are] these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
\[26]And Judah acknowledged [them], and said She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son: and he knew her again no more.
\[27]And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that behold, twins [were] in her womb.
\[28]And it came to pass when she travailed, that [the one] put out [his] hand; and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
\[29]And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out; and she said, How hast thou broken forth? [this] breach [be] upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.
\[30]And afterwards came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand; and his name was called Zarah.

nd Joseph was brought down to Egypt: and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down thither.
\[2]And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man: and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
\[3]And his master saw that the LORD [was] with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
\[4]And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all [that] he had he put into his hand.
\[5]And it came to pass from the time [that] he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake: and the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in the house, and in the field.
\[6]And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught he had, save the bread which he ate; and Joseph was [a] goodly [person], and well favored.
\[7]And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph: and she said, Lie with me.
\[8]But he refused, and said to his master's wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what [is] with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand:
\[9][There is] none greater in his house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou [art] his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
\[10]And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not to her, to lie by her, [or] to be with her.
\[11]And it came to pass, about this time, that [Joseph] went into the house to do his business; and [there was] none of the men of the house there within.
\[12]And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and went out.
\[13]And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had fled forth,
\[14]That she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us: he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
\[15]And it came to pass, when he heard that I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and went out.
\[16]And she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home.
\[17]And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought to us, came in to me to mock me.
\[18]And it came to pass, as I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled.
\[19]And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
\[20]And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners [were] bound: and he was there in the prison.
\[21]But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
\[22]And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that [were] in the prison; and whatever they did there, was done by him.

nd it came to pass after these things, [that] the butler of the king of Egypt and [his] baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
\[2]And Pharaoh was wroth with two [of] his officers, with the chief of the butlers, and with the chief of the bakers.
\[3]And he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph [was] bound.
\[4]And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them; and they continued a season in custody.
\[5]And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream; the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who [were] bound in the prison.
\[6]And Joseph came to them in the morning, and looked upon them, and behold, they [were] sad.
\[7]And he asked Pharaoh's officers that [were] with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Why look ye [so] sad to-day?
\[8]And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and [there is] no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, [Do] not interpretations [belong] to God? tell me [them], I pray you.
\[9]And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine [was] before me;
\[10]And on the vine [were] three branches: and it [was] as though it budded, [and] its blossoms shot forth; and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes:
\[11]And Pharaoh's cup [was] in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
\[12]And Joseph said to him, This [is] the interpretation of it: The three branches [are] three days;
\[13]Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee to thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
\[14]But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness to me, I pray thee, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:
\[15]For indeed I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
\[16]When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also [was] in my dream, and behold, [I had] three white baskets on my head:
\[17]And in the uppermost basket [there was] of all manner of bake-meats for Pharaoh; and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head.
\[18]And Joseph answered, and said, This [is] the interpretation of it: The three baskets [are] three days:
\[19]Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
\[20]And it came to pass the third day, [which was] Pharaoh's birth-day, that he made a feast to all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
\[21]And he restored the chief butler to his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
\[22]But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.

nd it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and behold, he stood by the river.
\[2]And behold, there came up out of the river seven well-favored cows and fat-fleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
\[3]And behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed; and stood by the [other] cows upon the brink of the river.
\[4]And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed cows ate up the seven well-favored and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.
\[5]And he slept and dreamed the second time: and behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
\[6]And behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
\[7]And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, [it was] a dream.
\[8]And it came to pass in the morning, that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but [there was] none that could interpret them to Pharaoh.
\[9]Then spoke the chief butler to Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
\[10]Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in custody in the captain of the guard's house, [both] me, and the chief baker:
\[11]And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he: we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
\[12]And [there was] there with us a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he interpreted.
\[13]And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was: me he restored to my office, and him he hanged.
\[14]Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved [himself], and changed his raiment, and came before Pharaoh.
\[15]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and [there is] none that can interpret it: and I have heard it said of thee, [that] thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
\[16]And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, [It is] not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
\[17]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:
\[18]And behold, there came out of the river seven cows, fat-fleshed, and well-favored; and they fed in a meadow:
\[19]And behold, seven other cows came out after them, poor, and very ill-favored, and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
\[20]And the lean and the ill-favored cows ate up the first seven fat cows:
\[21]And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they [were] still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
\[22]And I saw in my dream, and behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, full and good:
\[23]And behold, seven ears, withered, thin, [and] blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
\[24]And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told [this] to the magicians; but [there was] none that could explain [it] to me.
\[25]And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh [is] one; God hath showed Pharaoh what he [is] about to do.
\[26]The seven good cows [are] seven years; and the seven good ears [are] seven years: the dream [is] one.
\[27]And the seven thin and ill-favored cows that came up after them [are] seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind will be seven years of famine.
\[28]This [is] the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh: What God [is] about to do he showeth to Pharaoh.
\[29]Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
\[30]And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
\[31]And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine following: for it [will be] very grievous.
\[32]And for that the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice; [it is] because the thing [is] established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
\[33]Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
\[34]Let Pharaoh do [this], and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
\[35]And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh; and let them keep food in the cities.
\[36]And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land may not perish through the famine.
\[37]And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
\[38]And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find [such a man] as this [is], a man in whom the spirit of God [is]?
\[39]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shown thee all this, [there is] none so discreet and wise as thou [art]:
\[40]Thou shalt be over my house, and according to thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
\[41]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
\[42]And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
\[43]And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had: and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him [ruler] over all the land of Egypt.
\[44]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I [am] Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
\[45]And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him for a wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On: and Joseph went over [all] the land of Egypt.
\[46]And Joseph [was] thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt: and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[47]And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfulls.
\[48]And he gathered all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field which [was] around every city, he laid up in the same.
\[49]And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for [it was] without number.
\[50]And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came: which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bore to him.
\[51]And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: For God, [said he], hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
\[52]And the name of the second called he Ephraim: for God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
\[53]And the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
\[54]And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
\[55]And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
\[56]And the famine was over all the face of the earth; and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold to the Egyptians; and the famine became severe in the land of Egypt.
\[57]And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy [corn]; because the famine was distressing in all lands.

ow when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
\[2]And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: go down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
\[3]And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
\[4]But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren: for he said, Lest perhaps mischief shall befall him.
\[5]And the sons of Israel came to buy [corn] among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
\[6]And Joseph [was] the governor over the land, [and] he [it was] that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed themselves before him [with] their faces to the earth.
\[7]And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange to them, and spoke roughly to them; and he said to them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
\[8]And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
\[9]And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said to them, Ye [are] spies; to see the nakedness of the land have ye come.
\[10]And they said to him, No, my lord, but to buy food have thy servants come.
\[11]We [are] all one man's sons; we [are] true [men]; thy servants are no spies.
\[12]And he said to them, No, but to see the nakedness of the land have ye come.
\[13]And they said, Thy servants [are] twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest [is] this day with our father, and one [is] not.
\[14]And Joseph said to them, That [is] what I spoke to you, saying, Ye [are] spies:
\[15]By this ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother shall come hither.
\[16]Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether [there is any] truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye [are] spies.
\[17]And he put them all together into custody three days.
\[18]And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live; [for] I fear God:
\[19]If ye [are] true [men], let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:
\[20]But bring your youngest brother to me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
\[21]And they said one to another, We [are] verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
\[22]And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the young man; and ye would not hear? therefore behold also his blood is required.
\[23]And they knew not that Joseph understood [them]; for he spoke to them by an interpreter.
\[24]And he turned himself away from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.
\[25]Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he to them.
\[26]And they loaded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
\[27]And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money: for behold, it [was] in his sack's mouth.
\[28]And he said to his brethren, My money is restored; and see [it is] even in my sack: and their heart failed [them], and they were afraid, saying one to another, What [is] this [that] God hath done to us?
\[29]And they came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell them, saying,
\[30]The man [who is] the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.
\[31]And we said to him, We [are] true [men]; we are no spies:
\[32]We [are] twelve brethren, sons of our father: one [is] not, and the youngest [is] this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
\[33]And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, By this shall I know that ye [are] true [men]: leave one of your brethren [here] with me, and take [food for] the famine of your households, and depart:
\[34]And bring your youngest brother to me: then shall I know that ye [are] no spies, but [that] ye [are] true [men]: then will I deliver to you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.
\[35]And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that behold, every man's bundle of money [was] in his sack; and when they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
\[36]And Jacob their father said to them, Me have ye bereaved: Joseph [is] not, and Simeon [is] not, and ye will take Benjamin [away]: all these things are against me.
\[37]And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
\[38]And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief shall befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

nd the famine [was] severe in the land.
\[2]And it came to pass, when they had consumed the corn which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little food.
\[3]And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man did solemnly protest to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother [be] with you.
\[4]If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
\[5]But if thou wilt not send [him], we will not go down, for the man said to us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother [be] with you.
\[6]And Israel said, Why dealt ye [so] ill with me, [as] to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
\[7]And they said, The man asked us strictly concerning our state, and our kindred, saying, [Is] your father yet alive? have ye [another] brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: Could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
\[8]And Judah said to Israel, his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, [and] also our little ones.
\[9]I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not to thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:
\[10]For except we had delayed, surely now we had returned this second time.
\[11]And their father Israel said to them, If [it must be] so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry to the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:
\[12]And take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks, carry [it] again in your hand; it may be it [was] an oversight:
\[13]Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man:
\[14]And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin: If I be bereaved, I am bereaved.
\[15]And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and arose, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
\[16]And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring [these] men home, and slay, and make ready: for [these] men shall dine with me at noon.
\[17]And the man did as Joseph commanded: and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
\[18]And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bond-men, and our asses.
\[19]And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,
\[20]And said, O sir, we came down indeed at the first time to buy food:
\[21]And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and behold, [every] man's money [was] in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
\[22]And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
\[23]And he said, Peace [be] to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out to them.
\[24]And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave [them] water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.
\[25]And they made ready the present against Joseph should come at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
\[26]And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which [was] in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
\[27]And he asked them of [their] welfare, and said, [Is] your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? [Is] he yet alive?
\[28]And they answered, Thy servant, our father, [is] in good health, he [is] yet alive: and they bowed their heads and made obeisance.
\[29]And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, [Is] this your younger brother, of whom ye spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to thee, my son.
\[30]And Joseph made haste; for his bowels yearned towards his brother: and he sought [where] to weep; and he entered into [his] chamber, and wept there.
\[31]And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
\[32]And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who ate with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that [is] an abomination to the Egyptians.
\[33]And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birth-right, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men wondered one at another.
\[34]And he took [and sent] messes to them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.

nd he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks [with] food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.
\[2]And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money: and he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
\[3]As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they, and their asses.
\[4][And] when they had gone out of the city, [and] were not [yet] far off, Joseph said to his steward, Arise, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say to them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?
\[5][Is] not this [the cup] in which my lord drinketh, and by which indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
\[6]And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words.
\[7]And they said to him, Why saith my lord these words? Far be it from us that thy servants should do according to this thing:
\[8]Behold, the money which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to thee from the land of Canaan: how then should we steal from thy lord's house silver or gold?
\[9]With whom [soever] of thy servants it shall be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bond-men.
\[10]And he said, Now also [let] it [be] according to your words: he with whom it shall be found, shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.
\[11]Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
\[12]And he searched, [and] began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
\[13]Then they rent their clothes, and loaded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
\[14]And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house, (for he [was] yet there:) and they fell before him on the ground.
\[15]And Joseph said to them, What deed [is] this that ye have done? knew ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?
\[16]And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold we [are] my lord's servants, both we, and [he] also with whom the cup is found.
\[17]And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, go in peace to your father.
\[18]Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thy anger burn against thy servant; for thou [art] even as Pharaoh.
\[19]My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
\[20]And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one: and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.
\[21]And thou saidst to thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him.
\[22]And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father; for [if] he should leave his father, [his father] would die.
\[23]And thou saidst to thy servants, Except your youngest brother shall come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
\[24]And it came to pass, when we came to thy servant, my father, we told him the words of my lord.
\[25]And our father said, Go again; buy us a little food.
\[26]And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother shall be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother shall [be] with us.
\[27]And thy servant my father, said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two [sons]:
\[28]And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:
\[29]And if ye take this also from me, and mischief shall befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
\[30]Now therefore, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; (seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life)
\[31]It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad [is] not [with us], that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father, with sorrow to the grave.
\[32]For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to thee, then I will bear the blame to my father for ever.
\[33]Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad, a bond-man to my lord; and let the lad return with his brethren.
\[34]For how shall I return to my father, and the lad [be] not with me? lest perhaps I see the evil that shall come on my father.

\[3]And Joseph said to his brethren, I [am] Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
\[4]And Joseph said to his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you: and they came near. And he said, I [am] Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
\[5]Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither; for God sent me before you to preserve life.
\[6]For these two years [hath] the famine [been] in the land: and yet [there are] five years, in which [there shall] neither [be] tillage nor harvest.
\[7]And God sent me before you, to preserve for you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
\[8]So now [it was] not you [that] sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[9]Haste ye, and return to my father, and say to him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me; delay not:
\[10]And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near to me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:
\[11]And there will I nourish thee, (for yet [there are] five years of famine,) lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, should come to poverty.
\[12]And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that [it is] my mouth that speaketh to you.
\[13]And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen: and ye shall haste, and bring down my father hither.
\[14]And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
\[15]Moreover, he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
\[16]And the fame of this was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
\[17]And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to thy brethren, This do ye; load your beasts, and go, return to the land of Canaan;
\[18]And take your father, and your households, and come to me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
\[19]Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take for yourselves wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
\[20]Also regard not your furniture; for the good of all the land of Egypt [is] yours.
\[21]And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
\[22]To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment: but to Benjamin he gave three hundred [pieces] of silver, and five changes of raiment.
\[23]And to his father he sent after this [manner]; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with corn and bread and meat, for his father by the way.
\[24]So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said to them, See that ye contend not by the way.
\[25]And they went up from Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father,
\[26]And told him, saying, Joseph [is] yet alive, and he [is] governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.
\[27]And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:
\[28]And Israel said, [It is] enough; Joseph my son [is] yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.

\[8]And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How old [art] thou?

\[10]And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
\[11]And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
\[12]And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread according to [their] families.
\[13]And [there was] no bread in all the land; for the famine [was] very distressing, so that the land of Egypt, and [all] the land of Canaan, fainted by reason of the famine.
\[14]And Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
\[15]And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence: for the money faileth.
\[16]And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money hath failed.
\[17]And they brought their cattle to Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread [in exchange] for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses; and he fed them with bread, for all their cattle, for that year.
\[18]When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not aught left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies and our lands:
\[19]Why shall we die before thy eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh: and give [us] seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.
\[20]And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.
\[21]And as for the people, he removed them to cities from [one] end of the borders of Egypt even to the [other] end thereof.
\[22]Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion [assigned them] by Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.
\[23]Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, [here is] seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
\[24]And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth [part] to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.
\[25]And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.
\[26]And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, [that] Pharaoh should have the fifth [part]; except the land of the priests only, [which] became not Pharaoh's.
\[27]And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions in it and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.
\[28]And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was a hundred and forty seven years.
\[29]And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:
\[30]But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.

\[3]And Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz, in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
\[4]And said to me, Behold I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee, [for] an everlasting possession.
\[5]And now, thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt, before I came to thee into Egypt, [are] mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
\[6]And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, [and] shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
\[7]And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan, in the way, when yet [there was] but a little way to come to Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath, the same [is] Beth-lehem.
\[8]And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who [are] these?
\[9]And Joseph said to his father, They [are] my sons, whom God hath given me in this [place]. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, to me, and I will bless them.
\[10](Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, [so that] he could not see:) And he brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
\[11]And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and lo, God hath shown me also thy seed.
\[12]And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
\[13]And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand towards Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand towards Israel's right hand, and brought [them] near to him.
\[14]And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid [it] upon Ephraim's head, who [was] the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands by design; for Manasseh [was] the first-born.
\[15]And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long to this day,
\[16]The angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac: and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
\[17]And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he lifted his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
\[18]And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father; for this [is] the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head.
\[19]And his father refused, and said, I know [it], my son, I know [it]; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
\[20]And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
\[21]And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die; but God shall be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.
\[22]Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.

\[3]Reuben, thou [art] my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellence of dignity, and the excellence of power:
\[4]Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou [it]; he went up to my couch.
\[5]Simeon and Levi [are] brethren: instruments of cruelty [are in], their habitations.
\[6]O my soul, come not thou into their secret; to their assembly, my honor, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they digged down a wall.
\[7]Cursed [be] their anger, for [it was] fierce: and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
\[8]Judah, thou [art he] whom thy brethren shall praise; thy hand [shall be] on the neck of thy enemies: thy father's children shall bow down before thee.
\[9]Judah [is] a lion's whelp; from the prey, my son, thou hast gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion: who shall rouse him up?
\[10]The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh shall come: and to him [shall be] the gathering of the people.

\[14]Issachar [is] a strong ass, couching down between two burdens:
\[15]And he saw that rest [was] good, and the land that [it was] pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant to tribute.
\[16]Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
\[17]Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse-heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.
\[18]I have waited for thy salvation O LORD.
\[19]Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.
\[20]Out of Asher his bread [shall be] fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.
\[21]Naphtali [is] a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
\[22]Joseph [is] a fruitful bough, [even] a fruitful bough by a well; [whose] branches run over the wall:
\[23]The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot [at him], and hated him:
\[24]But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty [God] of Jacob: from thence [is] the shepherd the stone of Israel:
\[25][Even] by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth beneath, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:
\[26]The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills; they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.

\[2]And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
\[3]And forty days were fulfilled for him; (for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed:) and the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
\[4]And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
\[5]My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
\[6]And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
\[7]And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
\[8]And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen.
\[9]And there went with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
\[10]And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which [is] beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
\[11]And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This [is] a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which [is] beyond Jordan.
\[12]And his sons did to him according as he commanded them:
\[13]For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying-place of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
\[14]And Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
\[15]And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will perhaps hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did to him.
\[16]And they sent messengers to Joseph, saying, Thy father commanded before he died, saying,
\[17]So shall ye say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did to thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
\[18]And his brethren also went and fell down before his face: and they said, Behold, we [are] thy servants.
\[19]And Joseph said to them, Fear not: for [am] I in the place of God?
\[20]But as for you, ye thought evil against me; [but] God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as [it is] this day, to save many people alive.
\[21]Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.
\[22]And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.
\[23]And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third [generation]: the children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were brought up upon Joseph's knees.
\[24]And Joseph said to his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land, to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
\[25]And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
\[26]So Joseph died, [being] a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

\[2]Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
\[3]Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
\[4]Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
\[5]And all the souls that descended from Jacob, were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt [already].
\[6]And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
\[7]And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and became exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
\[8]Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
\[9]And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel [are] more and mightier than we.
\[10]Come, let us deal wisely with them: lest they multiply, and it shall come to pass, that when there falleth out any war, they will join with our enemies, and fight against us, and depart from the land.
\[11]Therefore they set over them task-masters, to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure-cities, Pithom, and Raamses.
\[12]But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
\[13]And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor.
\[14]And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service in which they made them serve, [was] with rigor.
\[15]And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives (of which the name of one [was] Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:)
\[16]And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see [them] upon the stools; if it [shall be] a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it [shall be] a daughter, then she shall live.
\[17]But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male-children alive.
\[18]And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the male-children alive?
\[19]And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women [are] not as the Egyptian women: for they [are] lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in to them.
\[20]Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and became very mighty.
\[21]And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.
\[22]And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

nd there went a man of the house of Levi, and married a daughter of Levi.
\[2]And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he [was a] goodly [child], she hid him three months.
\[3]And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid [it] in the flags by the river's brink.
\[4]And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.
\[5]And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash [herself] at the river, and her maidens walked along by the river's side: and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.
\[6]And when she had opened [it], she saw the child: and behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This [is one] of the Hebrews' children.
\[7]Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go, and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
\[8]And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.
\[9]And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give [thee] thy wages. And the woman took the child and nursed it.
\[10]And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.
\[11]And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
\[12]And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that [there was] no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
\[13]And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Why smitest thou thy fellow?
\[14]And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.
\[15]Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.
\[16]Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew [water], and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
\[17]And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
\[18]And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How [is it that] you are come so soon to day?
\[19]And they said, An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and also drew [water] enough for us, and watered the flock.
\[20]And he said to his daughters, And where [is] he? why [is] it [that] ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.
\[21]And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
\[22]And she bore [him] a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.
\[23]And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried; and their cry ascended to God, by reason of the bondage.
\[24]And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

\[2]And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush [was] not consumed.
\[3]And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
\[4]And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here [am] I.
\[5]And he said, Approach not hither: put off thy shoes from thy feet, for the place on which thou standest [is] holy ground.
\[6]Moreover he said, I [am] the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face: for he was afraid to look upon God.
\[7]And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who [are] in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their task-masters; for I know their sorrows;
\[8]And I am come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land, to a good land, and a large, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
\[9]Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come to me: and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.
\[10]Come now therefore, and I will send thee to Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
\[11]And Moses said to God, Who [am] I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
\[12]And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this [shall be] a token to thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
\[13]And Moses said to God, Behold, [when] I come to the children of Israel, and shall say to them, The God of your fathers hath sent me to you; and they shall say to me, What [is] his name? What shall I say to them?
\[14]And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: And he said, Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me to you.
\[15]And God said, moreover, to Moses, Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me to you: this [is] my name for ever, and this [is] my memorial to all generations.
\[16]Go and assemble the elders of Israel, and say to them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and [seen] that which is done to you in Egypt.
\[17]And I have said, I will bring you out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.
\[18]And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and ye shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go (we beseech thee) three days journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
\[19]And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.
\[20]And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.
\[21]And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that when ye go, ye shall not go empty:

\[4]And the LORD said to Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:
\[5]That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee.
\[6]And the LORD said furthermore to him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand [was] leprous as snow.
\[7]And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again, and drew it out of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again as his [other] flesh.
\[8]And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.

\[10]And Moses said to the LORD, O my Lord, I [am] not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoke to thy servant: but I [am] slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.
\[11]And the LORD said to him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD.
\[12]Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.
\[13]And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand [of him whom] thou wilt send.
\[14]And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, [Is] not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.

\[17]And thou shalt take this rod in thy hand, with which thou shalt perform signs.
\[18]And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return to my brethren who [are] in Egypt, and see whether they are yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.
\[19]And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead who sought thy life.
\[20]And Moses took his wife, and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
\[21]And the LORD said to Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou perform all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in thy hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.
\[22]And thou shalt say to Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel [is] my son, [even] my first-born.
\[23]And I say to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou shalt refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, [even] thy first-born.

\[25]Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast [it] at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband [art] thou to me.
\[26]So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband [thou art], because of the circumcision.
\[27]And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.
\[28]And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.

\[3]And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice to the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.
\[4]And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do ye, Moses and Aaron, hinder the people from their works; go you to your burdens.
\[5]And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now [are] many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.
\[6]And Pharaoh commanded the same day the task-masters of the people, and their officers, saying,
\[7]Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore; let them go and gather straw for themselves.
\[8]And the number of the bricks which they made heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish [aught] thereof; for they are idle: therefore they cry, saying, Let us go [and] sacrifice to our God.
\[9]Let more work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein: and let them not regard vain words.
\[10]And the task-masters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.
\[11]Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not aught of your work shall be diminished.
\[12]So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble instead of straw.
\[13]And the task-masters hastened [them], saying, Fulfill your works, [your] daily tasks, as when there was straw.
\[14]And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's task-masters had set over them, were beaten, [and] demanded, Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick, both yesterday and to-day, as heretofore?
\[15]Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why dealest thou thus with thy servants?
\[16]There is no straw given to thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and behold, thy servants [are] beaten; but the fault [is] in thy own people.
\[17]But he said, Ye [are] idle, [ye are] idle: therefore ye say, Let us go, [and] do sacrifice to the LORD.
\[18]Go therefore now, [and] work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks.
\[19]And the officers of the children of Israel saw [that] they [were] in evil [case], after it was said, Ye shall not diminish [aught] from your bricks of your daily task.
\[20]And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:
\[21]And they said to them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hands to slay us.
\[22]And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Lord, why hast thou [so] ill treated this people? why [is] it [that] thou hast sent me?
\[23]For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

\[2]And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I [am] the LORD:
\[3]And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by [the name of] God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.
\[4]And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were strangers.
\[5]And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage: and I have remembered my covenant.
\[6]Wherefore say to the children of Israel, I [am] the LORD, and I will bring you from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with out-stretched arm, and with great judgments:
\[7]And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
\[8]And I will bring you into the land, concerning which I swore to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I [am] the LORD.
\[9]And Moses spoke so to the children of Israel: but they hearkened not to Moses, by reason of anguish of spirit, and cruel bondage.
\[10]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[11]Go in, speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel depart from his land.
\[12]And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened to me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who [am] of uncircumcised lips?
\[13]And the LORD spoke to Moses, and to Aaron, and gave them a charge to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
\[14]These [are] the heads of their father's houses: The sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these [are] the families of Reuben.
\[15]And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these [are] the families of Simeon.
\[16]And these [are] the names of the sons of Levi, according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi [were] a hundred and thirty-seven years.
\[17]The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.
\[18]And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath [were] a hundred and thirty-three years.
\[19]And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these [are] the families of Levi, according to their generations.
\[20]And Amram took him Jochebed, his father's sister, for a wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram [were] a hundred and thirty-seven years.
\[21]And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.
\[22]And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.
\[23]And Aaron took him Elisheba daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, for a wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
\[24]And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these [are] the families of the Korhites.
\[25]And Eleazar, Aaron's son, took him [one] of the daughters of Putiel for a wife; and she bore to him Phinehas: these [are] the heads of the fathers of the Levites, according to their families.
\[26]These [are] that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.
\[27]These [are] they who spoke to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these [are] that Moses and Aaron.
\[28]And it came to pass, on the day [when] the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
\[29]That the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, I [am] the LORD: speak thou to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, all that I say to thee.
\[30]And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I [am] of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken to me?

\[2]Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.
\[3]And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
\[4]But Pharaoh shall not hearken to you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my armies, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt, by great judgments.
\[5]And the Egyptians shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.
\[6]And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.
\[7]And Moses [was] eighty years old, and Aaron eighty and three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
\[8]And the LORD spoke to Moses, and to Aaron, saying,
\[9]When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Show a miracle for you: then thou shalt say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast [it] before Pharaoh, [and] it shall become a serpent.
\[10]And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
\[11]Then Pharaoh also called the wise-men, and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.
\[12]For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
\[13]And he hardened Pharaoh's heart that he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had said.
\[14]And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart [is] hardened; he refuseth to let the people go.
\[15]Go to Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out to the water, and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he cometh; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand.
\[16]And thou shalt say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me to thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.
\[17]Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that [is] in my hand upon the waters which [are] in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.
\[18]And the fish that [is] in the river shall die, and the river shall be offensive in smell; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.
\[19]And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood: and [that] there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in [vessels of] wood, and in [vessels of] stone.
\[20]And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that [were] in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that [were] in the river were turned into blood.
\[21]And the fish that [was] in the river died; and the river was offensive in smell, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[22]And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken to them; as the LORD had said.
\[23]And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he regard this also.
\[24]And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.

\[2]And if thou shalt refuse to let [them] go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:
\[3]And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bed-chamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy ovens, and into thy kneading troughs:
\[4]And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.
\[5]And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.
\[6]And Aaron stretched his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
\[7]And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
\[8]Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the LORD that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people: and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice to the LORD.
\[9]And Moses said to Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee, and thy houses, [that] they may remain in the river only?
\[10]And he said, To-morrow. And he said, [Be it] according to thy word; that thou mayest know that [there is] none like the LORD our God.
\[11]And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.
\[12]And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried to the LORD, because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.
\[13]And the LORD did according to the word of Moses: and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.
\[14]And they gathered them into heaps: and the land was offensive in smell.
\[15]But when Pharaoh saw that there was respit, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not to them, as the LORD had said.
\[16]And the LORD said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[17]And they did so: for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[18]And the magicians did so with their inchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man and upon beast.
\[19]Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This [is] the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had said.
\[20]And the LORD said to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; (lo, he cometh forth to the water) and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[21]Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms [of flies] upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms [of flies], and also the ground on which they [are].
\[22]And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms [of flies] shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I [am] the LORD in the midst of the earth.
\[23]And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to-morrow shall this sign be.
\[24]And the LORD did so: and there came a grievous swarm [of flies] into the house of Pharaoh, and [into] his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm [of flies].
\[25]And Pharaoh called for Moses, and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.
\[26]And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: Lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?
\[27]We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God as he shall command us.
\[28]And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: entreat for me.
\[29]And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms [of flies] may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to-morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more, in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.
\[30]And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD:
\[31]And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms [of flies] from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.

\[2]For if thou shalt refuse to let [them] go, and wilt hold them still,
\[3]Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: [there shall be] a very grievous murrain.
\[4]And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel, and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all [that] belongs to the children of Israel.
\[5]And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow the LORD will do this thing in the land.
\[6]And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.
\[7]And Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
\[8]And the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it towards heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.
\[9]And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth [with] blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[10]And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it towards heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth [with] blains upon man, and upon beast.
\[11]And the magicians could not stand before Moses, because of the boil: for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.
\[12]And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had spoke to Moses.
\[13]And the LORD said to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[14]For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people: that thou mayest know that [there is] none like me in all the earth.
\[15]For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.
\[16]And in very deed for this [cause] have I raised thee up, to show [in] thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.
\[17]As yet dost thou exalt thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?
\[18]Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since its foundation even until now.
\[19]Send therefore now, [and] gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field: [for upon] every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.
\[20]He that feared the word of the LORD, among the servants of Pharaoh, made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:
\[21]And he that regarded not the word of the LORD, left his servants and his cattle in the field.
\[22]And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand towards heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.
\[23]And Moses stretched forth his rod towards heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground: and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
\[24]So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there had been none like it in all the land of Egypt, since it became a nation.
\[25]And the hail smote, throughout all the land of Egypt, all that [was] in the field, both man and beast, and the hail smote every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field.
\[26]Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel [were], there was no hail.
\[27]And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time: the LORD [is] righteous, and I and my people [are] wicked.
\[28]Entreat the LORD (for [it is] enough) that there be no [more] mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.
\[29]And Moses said to him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to the LORD; [and] the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth [is] the LORD'S.
\[30]But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.
\[31]And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley [was] in the ear, and the flax [was] bolled.
\[32]But the wheat and the rye were not smitten; for they [were] not grown up.
\[33]And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.
\[34]And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
\[35]And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.

\[3]And Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[4]Else, if thou shalt refuse to let my people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring the locusts into thy border:
\[5]And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which hath escaped, which remaineth to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:
\[6]And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth to this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.
\[7]And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?
\[8]And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh: and he said to them, Go, serve the LORD your God: [but] who [are] they that shall go?
\[9]And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we [must hold] a feast to the LORD.
\[10]And he said to them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look [to it]; for evil [is] before you.
\[11]Not so: go now ye [that are] men, and serve the LORD; for that you desired. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
\[12]And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, [even] all that the hail hath left.
\[13]And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all [that] night: [and] when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
\[14]And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt: very grievous [were they]; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them will be such.
\[15]For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing on the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
\[16]Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.
\[17]Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the LORD your God that he may take away from me this death only.
\[18]And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.
\[19]And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea: there remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.
\[20]But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.
\[21]And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand towards heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness [which] may be felt.
\[22]And Moses stretched forth his hand towards heaven: and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:
\[23]They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
\[24]And Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.
\[25]And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices, and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
\[26]Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind; for of them must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.

\[3]Speak ye to all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth [day] of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of [their] fathers, a lamb for a house:
\[4]And if the household shall be too small for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next to his house take [it] according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.
\[5]Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take [it] from the sheep or from the goats:
\[6]And ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.
\[7]And they shall take of the blood, and strike [it] on the two side-posts, and on the upper door-post of the houses, in which they shall eat it.
\[8]And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire; and unleavened bread, [and] with bitter [herbs] they shall eat it.
\[9]Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted [with] fire; its head with its legs, and with its entrails.
\[10]And ye shall let nothing of it remain till the morning: and that which remaineth of it till the morning ye shall burn with fire.
\[11]And thus shall ye eat it; [with] your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand: and ye shall eat it in haste; it [is] the LORD'S passover.
\[12]For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast: and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I [am] the LORD.
\[13]And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye [are]: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy [you], when I smite the land of Egypt.
\[14]And this day shall be to you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations: ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.
\[15]Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whoever eateth leavened bread, from the first day till the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
\[16]And in the first day [there shall be] a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you: no manner of work shall be done in them, save [that] which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.
\[17]And ye shall observe [the feast of] unleavened bread; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.
\[18]In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, ye shall eat unleavened bread, till the one and twentieth day of the month at evening.

\[24]And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.
\[25]And it shall come to pass, when ye shall have come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.
\[26]And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say to you, What mean you by this service?
\[27]That ye shall say, It [is] the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshiped.
\[28]And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
\[29]And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne, to the first-born of the captive that [was] in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle.
\[30]And Pharaoh rose in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt: for [there was] not a house where [there was] not one dead.
\[31]And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Arise, [and] depart from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel: and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.
\[32]Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone: and bless me also.
\[33]And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We [are] all dead [men].
\[34]And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.
\[35]And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses: and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment.
\[36]And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent to them [such things as they requested]: and they spoiled the Egyptians.
\[37]And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot [that were] men, besides children.
\[38]And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, [even] very many cattle.
\[39]And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought from Egypt, for it was not leavened: because they were driven from Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals.
\[40]Now the sojourning of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt, [was] four hundred and thirty years.
\[41]And it came to pass, at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the same day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD departed from the land of Egypt.
\[42]It [is] a night to be much observed to the LORD, for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this [is] that night of the LORD to be observed by all the children of Israel in their generations.
\[43]And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, This [is] the ordinance of the passover: there shall no stranger eat of it.
\[44]But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat of it.
\[45]A foreigner, and a hired servant shall not eat of it.
\[46]In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry aught of the flesh abroad out of the house: neither shall ye break a bone of it.
\[47]All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
\[48]And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.
\[49]One law shall be to him that is home-born, and to the stranger that sojourneth among you.
\[50]Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
\[51]And it came to pass the same day, [that] the LORD brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.

nd the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[2]Sanctify to me all the first-born, whatever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, [both] of man and of beast: it [is] mine.
\[3]And Moses said to the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this [place]: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.
\[4]This day ye came out in the month Abib.
\[5]And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey; that thou shalt keep this service in this month.
\[6]Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day [shall be] a feast to the LORD.
\[7]Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days: and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.
\[8]And thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying, [This is done] because of that [which] the LORD did to me when I came forth out of Egypt.
\[9]And it shall be for a sign to thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thy eyes; that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.
\[10]Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
\[11]And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it to thee,
\[12]That thou shall set apart to the LORD all that openeth the matrix; and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast, the males [shall be] the LORD'S.
\[13]And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the first-born of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.
\[14]And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What [is] this? that thou shalt say to him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:
\[15]And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beasts: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the first-born of my children I redeem.
\[16]And it shall be for a token upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thy eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.
\[17]And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not [through] the way of the land of the Philistines, although that [was] near, for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt.
\[18]But God led the people about, [through] the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up harnassed from the land of Egypt.
\[19]And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had strictly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones hence with you.
\[20]And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
\[21]And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them in the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light: to go by day and night.
\[22]He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, [from] before the people.

nd the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[2]Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.
\[3]For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They [are] entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.
\[4]And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow them; and I will be honored upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I [am] the LORD. And they did so.
\[5]And it was told to the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?
\[6]And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:
\[7]And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.
\[8]And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with a high hand.
\[9]But the Egyptians pursued them (all the horses [and] chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army) and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.
\[10]And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were greatly afraid; and the children of Israel cried to the LORD.
\[11]And they said to Moses, Because [there were] no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why hast thou dealt thus with us, to conduct us out of Egypt?
\[12][Is] not this the word that we told thee in Egypt, Saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For [it had been] better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.
\[13]And Moses said to the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will show to you to-day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.
\[14]The LORD will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
\[15]And the LORD said to Moses, Why criest thou to me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward:
\[16]But lift thou thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go on dry [ground] through the midst of the sea.
\[17]And I, behold I, will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots and upon his horsemen.
\[18]And the Egyptians shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
\[19]And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed, and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:
\[20]And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness [to them], but it gave light by night [to these]: so that the one came not near the other all the night.
\[21]And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD caused the sea to go [back] by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry [land], and the waters were divided.
\[22]And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry [ground]: and the waters [were] a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.
\[23]And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, [even] all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
\[24]And it came to pass, that, in the morning-watch, the LORD looked to the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire, and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,
\[25]And took off their chariot-wheels, and made them to move heavily, so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.
\[26]And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.
\[27]And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
\[28]And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, [and] all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.
\[29]But the children of Israel walked upon dry [land] in the midst of the sea; and the waters [were] a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.
\[30]Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians: and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore.
\[31]And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.

\[2]The LORD [is] my strength and song, and he [is] become my salvation: he [is] my God, and I will prepare him a habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.
\[3]The LORD [is] a man of war: the LORD [is] his name.
\[4]Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.
\[5]The depths have covered them: they sunk to the bottom as a stone.
\[6]Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.
\[7]And in the greatness of thy excellence thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, [which] consumed them as stubble.
\[8]And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were collected, the floods stood upright as a heap, [and] the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.
\[9]The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
\[10]Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sunk as lead in the mighty waters.
\[11]Who [is] like to thee, O LORD, among the gods? who [is] like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders!
\[12]Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.
\[13]Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people [which] thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided [them] in thy strength to thy holy habitation.
\[14]The people shall hear, [and] be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.
\[15]Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.
\[16]Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thy arm they shall be [as] still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, [which] thou hast purchased.
\[17]Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance, [in] the place, O LORD, [which] thou hast made for thee to dwell in; [in] the sanctuary, O Lord. [which] thy hands have established.
\[18]The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.
\[19]For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry [land] in the midst of the sea.
\[20]And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her, with timbrels, and with dances.
\[21]And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
\[22]So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
\[23]And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah; for they [were] bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.
\[24]And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
\[25]And he cried to the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree, [which] he cast into the waters, [and] the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,
\[26]And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes; I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians; for I [am] the LORD that healeth thee.

nd they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which [is] between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt.
\[2]And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
\[3]And the children of Israel said to them, O that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, [and] when we did eat bread to the full: for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
\[4]Then said the LORD to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.
\[5]And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare [that] which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
\[6]And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, At evening, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:
\[7]And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: And what [are] we, that ye murmur against us?
\[8]And Moses said, [This shall be] when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: And what [are] we? your murmurings [are] not against us, but against the LORD.
\[9]And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.
\[10]And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked towards the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
\[11]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[12]I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel; Speak to them, saying, At evening ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread: and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD your God.
\[13]And it came to pass, that at evening the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay around the host.
\[14]And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness [there lay] a small round thing, [as] small as the hoar frost on the ground:
\[15]And when the children of Israel saw [it], they said one to another, It [is] manna: for they knew not what it [was]. And Moses said to them, This [is] the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.
\[16]This [is] the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating: an omer for every man [according to] the number of your persons, take ye every man for [them] who [are] in his tents.
\[17]And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.
\[18]And when they measured [it] with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack: they gathered every man according to his eating.
\[19]And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
\[20]Notwithstanding, they hearkened not to Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became offensive; and Moses was wroth with them.
\[21]And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun became hot, it melted.
\[22]And it came to pass, [that] on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one [man]: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
\[23]And he said to them, This [is that] which the LORD hath said, To-morrow [is] the rest of the holy sabbath to the LORD: bake [that] which ye will bake [to-day], and boil that ye will boil; and that which remaineth over, lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
\[24]And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses ordered: and it did not putrefy, neither was there any worm therein.
\[25]And Moses said, Eat that to-day; for to-day [is] a sabbath to the LORD; to-day ye will not find it in the field.
\[26]Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, [which is] the sabbath, in it there will be none.
\[27]And it came to pass, [that some] of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, and they found none.
\[28]And the LORD said to Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?
\[29]See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days: abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
\[30]So the people rested on the seventh day.
\[31]And the house of Israel called its name Manna: and it [was] like coriander-seed, white; and the taste of it [was] like wafers [made] with honey.
\[32]And Moses said, This [is] the thing which the LORD commanded, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.
\[33]And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.
\[34]As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
\[35]And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited: they ate manna, until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.
\[36]Now an omer [is] the tenth [part] of an ephah.

nd all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and encamped in Rephidim: and [there was] no water for the people to drink.
\[2]Wherefore the people contended with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why chide you with me? why do ye tempt the LORD?
\[3]And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why [is] this [that] thou hast brought us out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?
\[4]And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, What shall I do to this people? they are almost ready to stone me.
\[5]And the LORD said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel: and thy rod, with which thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go.
\[6]Behold, I will stand before thee there on the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and water shall come out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
\[7]And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?
\[8]Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
\[9]And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.
\[10]So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur, went up to the top of the hill.
\[11]And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
\[12]But Moses's hands [were] heavy; and they took a stone, and put [it] under him, and he sat upon it: and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
\[13]And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
\[14]And the LORD said to Moses, Write this [for] a memorial in a book, and rehearse [it] in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
\[15]And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it JEHOVAH-nissi:

\[2]Then Jethro, Moses's father-in-law, took Zipporah Moses's wife, after he had sent her back,
\[3]And her two sons; of which the name of the one [was] Gershom; (for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:)
\[4]And the name of the other [was] Eliezer; (for the God of my father, [said he], [was] my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:)
\[5]And Jethro, Moses's father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:
\[6]And he said to Moses, I thy father-in-law Jethro have come to thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
\[7]And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him: and they asked each other of [their] welfare: and they came into the tent.
\[8]And Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh, and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, [and] all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and [how] the LORD delivered them.
\[9]And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.
\[10]And Jethro said, Blessed [be] the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
\[11]Now I know that the LORD [is] greater than all gods: for in the thing in which they dealt proudly, [he was] above them.

\[13]And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening.
\[14]And when Moses's father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What [is] this thing that thou doest to the people? Why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning to evening?
\[15]And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God:
\[16]When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between one and another, and I make [them] know the statutes of God, and his laws.
\[17]And Moses's father-in-law said to him, The thing that thou doest [is] not good.
\[18]Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that [is] with thee: for this thing [is] too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.
\[19]Hearken now to my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people toward God, that thou mayest bring the causes to God:
\[20]And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.
\[21]Moreover, thou shalt provide out of all the people, able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place [such] over them [to be] rulers of thousands, [and] rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:
\[22]And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, [that] every great matter they shall bring to thee, but every small matter they shall judge: So shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear [the burden] with thee.
\[23]If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee [so], then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.
\[24]So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.
\[25]And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
\[26]And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
\[27]And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.

\[3]And Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;
\[4]Ye have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and [how] I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.
\[5]Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth [is] mine:
\[6]And ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These [are] the words which thou shalt speak to the children of Israel.
\[7]And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.
\[8]And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people to the LORD.
\[9]And the LORD said to Moses, Lo, I come to thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.
\[10]And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their clothes,
\[11]And be ready against the third day: for on the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
\[12]And thou shalt set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, [that ye] go [not] up upon the mount, or touch the border of it: whoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:
\[13]There shall not a hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through: whether [it be] beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.
\[14]And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.
\[15]And he said to the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at [your] wives.
\[16]And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that [were] in the camp trembled.
\[17]And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
\[18]And mount Sinai was altogether in a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke of it ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount trembled greatly.
\[19]And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.
\[20]And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.
\[21]And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.
\[22]And let the priests also who come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.
\[23]And Moses said to the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.
\[24]And the LORD said to him, Away, go down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: But let not the priests and the people break through, to come up to the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.
\[25]So Moses went down to the people, and spoke to them.

nd God spoke all these words, saying,
\[2]I [am] the LORD thy God, who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
\[3]Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
\[4]Thou shalt not make to thee any graven image, or any likeness [of any thing] that [is] in heaven above, or that [is] in the earth beneath, or that [is] in the water under the earth:
\[5]Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God [am] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth [generation] of them that hate me;
\[6]And showing mercy to thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
\[7]Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
\[8]Remember the sabbath-day to keep it holy.
\[9]Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work:
\[10]But the seventh day [is] the sabbath of the LORD thy God: [in it] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that [is] within thy gates:
\[11]For [in] six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that [is] in them, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath-day, and hallowed it.
\[12]Honor thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
\[13]Thou shalt not kill.
\[14]Thou shalt not commit adultery.
\[15]Thou shalt not steal.
\[16]Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
\[17]Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that [is] thy neighbor's.
\[18]And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw [it], they removed, and stood afar off.
\[19]And they said to Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
\[20]And Moses said to the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.
\[21]And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God [was].
\[22]And the LORD said to Moses, Thus thou shalt say to the children of Israel; Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
\[23]Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make to you gods of gold.
\[24]An altar of earth thou shalt make to me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thy oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come to thee, and I will bless thee.
\[25]And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou [shalt] lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
\[26]Neither shalt thou go up by steps to my altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.

ow these [are] the judgments which thou shalt set before them.
\[2]If thou shalt buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall depart free for nothing.
\[3]If he came in by himself, he shall depart by himself: if he was married, then his wife shall depart with him.
\[4]If his master hath given him a wife, and she hath borne him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall depart by himself.
\[5]And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not depart free:
\[6]Then his master shall bring him to the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door-post: and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.
\[7]And if a man shall sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not depart as the men-servants do.
\[8]If she shall not please her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her to a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.
\[9]And if he hath betrothed her to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
\[10]If he shall take him another [wife]; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish.
\[11]And if he shall not perform these three to her, then shall she depart free without money.
\[12]He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall be surely put to death.
\[13]And if a man shall not lie in wait, but God shall deliver [him] into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.
\[14]But if a man shall come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from my altar, that he may die.
\[15]And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.
\[16]And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he shall be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.
\[17]And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.
\[18]And if men contend together, and one shall smite another with a stone, or with [his] fist, and he shall not die, but keep [his] bed:
\[19]If he shall rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote [him] be quit: only he shall pay [for] the loss of his time, and shall cause [him] to be thoroughly healed.
\[20]And if a man shall smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he shall die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.
\[21]Notwithstanding, if he shall continue a day or two, he shall not be punished; for he [is] his money.
\[22]If men shall contend, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit shall depart [from her], and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges [determine].
\[23]And if [any] mischief shall follow, then thou shalt give life for life,
\[24]Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
\[25]Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
\[26]And if a man shall smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it shall perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.
\[27]And if he shall smite out his man-servant's tooth, or his maid-servant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.
\[28]If an ox shall gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox [shall be] quit.
\[29]But if the ox was accustomed to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not restrained him, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.
\[30]If there shall be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatever is laid upon him.
\[31]Whether he hath gored a son, or hath gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done to him.
\[32]If the ox shall push a man-servant, or maid-servant; he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
\[33]And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass shall fall into it;
\[34]The owner of the pit shall make compensation, [and] give money to the owner of them; and the dead [beast] shall be his.
\[35]And if one man's ox shall hurt another's that he shall die, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it, and the dead [ox] also they shall divide.
\[36]Or if it shall be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not restrained him; he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead shall be his own.

\[24]And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
\[25]If thou shalt lend money to [any of] my people [that is] poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as a usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.

\[27]For that [is] his only covering, it [is] his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth to me, that I will hear; for I [am] gracious.

\[24]Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.
\[25]And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he will bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
\[26]There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: I will complete the number of thy days.
\[27]I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thy enemies turn their backs to thee.
\[28]And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite from before thee.
\[29]I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land should become desolate, and the beast of the field should multiply against thee.
\[30]By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou shalt be increased and inherit the land.
\[31]And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.
\[32]Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

\[2]And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden ear-rings which [are] in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring [them] to me.
\[3]And all the people broke off the golden ear-rings which [were] in their ears, and brought [them] to Aaron.
\[4]And he received [them] at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt.
\[5]And when Aaron saw [it], he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To-morrow [is] a feast to the LORD.
\[6]And they rose early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings: and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
\[7]And the LORD said to Moses, Go, go down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted [themselves]:
\[8]They have turned aside quickly from the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.
\[9]And the LORD said to Moses, I have seen this people, and behold it [is] a stiff-necked people:
\[10]Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.
\[11]And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth from the land of Egypt, with great power, and with a mighty hand?
\[12]Why should the Egyptians speak and say, For evil did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.
\[13]Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel thy servants, to whom thou sworest by thine own self, and saidst to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit [it] for ever.
\[14]And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do to his people.
\[15]And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony [were] in his hand: the tables [were] written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other [were] they written.
\[16]And the tables [were] the work of God, and the writing [was] the writing of God, graven upon the tables.
\[17]And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, [There is] a noise of war in the camp.
\[18]And he said, [It is] not the voice of [them that] shout for mastery, neither [is it] the voice of [them that] cry for being overcome: [but] the noise of [them that] sing do I hear.
\[19]And it came to pass as soon as he came nigh to the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses's anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables from his hands, and broke them beneath the mount.
\[20]And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt [it] in the fire, and ground [it] to powder, and strewed [it] upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink [of it].
\[21]And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people to thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?
\[22]And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people that they [are set] on mischief.
\[23]For they said to me, Make us gods which shall go before us: for [as for] this Moses, the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
\[24]And I said to them, Whoever hath any gold, let them break [it] off: So they gave [it] to me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.
\[25]And when Moses saw that the people [were] naked (for Aaron had made them naked to [their] shame, among their enemies:)
\[26]Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who [is] on the LORD'S side? [let him come] to me. And all the sons of Levi assembled themselves to him.
\[27]And he said to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, [and] go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.
\[28]And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
\[29]For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.
\[30]And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said to the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up to the LORD; it may be I shall make an atonement for your sin.
\[31]And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.
\[32]Yet now, if thou wilt, forgive their sin: and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.
\[33]And the LORD said to Moses, Whoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
\[34]Therefore now go, lead the people to [the place] of which I have spoken to thee: Behold, my angel shall go before thee: Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.
\[35]And the LORD afflicted the people, because they made the calf which Aaron made.

nd the LORD said to Moses, Depart [and] go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast conducted from the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, to thy seed will I give it:
\[2]And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
\[3]To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou [art] a stiff-necked people: lest I consume thee in the way.
\[4]And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man put on him his ornaments.
\[5]For the LORD had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, Ye [are] a stiff-necked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do to thee.
\[6]And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, by the mount Horeb.
\[7]And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp far from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, [that] every one who sought the LORD, went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which [was] without the camp.
\[8]And it came to pass when Moses went out to the tabernacle, [that] all the people rose, and stood every man at his tent-door, and looked after Moses, until he had gone into the tabernacle.
\[9]And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood [at] the door of the tabernacle, and [the LORD] talked with Moses.
\[10]And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand [at] the tabernacle door: and all the people rose and worshiped, every man [in] his tent-door.
\[11]And the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaketh to his friend. And he turned again into the camp; but his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.
\[12]And Moses said to the LORD, See, thou sayest to me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.
\[13]Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation [is] thy people.
\[14]And he said, My presence shall attend [thee], and I will give thee rest.
\[15]And he said to him, If thy presence shall not attend me, conduct us not hence.
\[16]For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? [Is it] not in that thou goest with us? So shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that [are] upon the face of the earth.
\[17]And the LORD said to Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.
\[18]And he said, I beseech thee, show me thy glory.
\[19]And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.
\[20]And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.
\[21]And the LORD said, Behold, [there is] a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:
\[22]And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock: and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:
\[23]And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.

\[2]And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount.
\[3]And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount: neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.
\[4]And he hewed two tables of stone, like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.
\[5]And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.
\[6]And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.
\[7]Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear [the guilty]; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, to the third and to the fourth [generation].
\[8]And Moses made haste, and bowed his head towards the earth, and worshiped.
\[9]And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us (for it [is] a stiff-necked people) and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thy inheritance.
\[10]And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do wonders, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou [art], shall see the work of the LORD: for it [is] a terrible thing that I will do with thee.
\[11]Observe thou that which I command thee this day: Behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
\[12]Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:
\[13]But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves.
\[14]For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name [is] Jealous, [is] a jealous God:
\[15]Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go astray after their gods, and do sacrifice to their gods, and [one] call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;
\[16]And thou take of their daughters to thy sons, and their daughters go astray after their gods, and make thy sons go astray after their gods.
\[17]Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
\[18]The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out of from Egypt.
\[19]Every first-born [is] mine: and every firstling among thy cattle, [whether] ox or sheep, [that is male].
\[20]But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou shalt not redeem him, then shalt thou break his neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.
\[21]Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in time of plowing and in harvest thou shalt rest.
\[22]And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the first-fruits of wheat-harvest, and the feast of in-gathering at the year's end.
\[23]Thrice in the year shall all your male children appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.
\[24]For I will drive out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God, thrice in the year.
\[25]Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven, neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left until the morning.
\[26]The first of the first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring to the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.
\[27]And the LORD said to Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee, and with Israel.
\[28]And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water: and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
\[29]And it came to pass when Moses came down from mount Sinai (with the two tables of testimony in Moses's hand, when he came down from the mount) that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone, while he talked with him.
\[30]And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come nigh him.
\[31]And Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses talked with them.
\[32]And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.
\[33]And [till] Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.
\[34]But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out and spoke to the children of Israel [that] which he was commanded.
\[35]And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses's face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

\[3]And they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it. And they brought yet to him free-offerings every morning.
\[4]And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made.

\[6]And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.
\[7]For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
\[8]And every wise-hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains [of] fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: he made them [with] cherubim of curious work.

\[19]And their pillars [were] four, and their sockets [of] brass four; their hooks [of] silver, and the overlaying of their capitals and their fillets [of] silver.
\[20]And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, [were of] brass.
\[21]This is the sum of the tabernacle, [even] of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, [for] the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest.
\[22]And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.
\[23]And with him [was] Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a skillful workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.
\[24]All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy [place], even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
\[25]And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation [was] a hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and seventy five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:
\[26]A bekah for every man, [that is], half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty [men].
\[27]And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; a hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.
\[28]And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five [shekels] he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals, and filleted them.
\[29]And the brass of the offering [was] seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.
\[30]And with this he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brazen altar, and the brazen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,

\[2]And he made the ephod [of] gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
\[3]And they beat the gold into thin plates, and cut [it into] wires, to work [it] in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, [with] curious work.
\[4]They made shoulder-pieces for it, to couple [it] together: by the two edges was it coupled together.
\[5]And the curious girdle of his ephod, that [was] upon it, [was] of the same, according to the work thereof; [of] gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[6]And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.
\[7]And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, [that they should be] stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[8]And he made the breast-plate [of] curious work, like the work of the ephod; [of] gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
\[9]It was foursquare; they made the breast-plate double: a span [was] the length of it, and a span the breadth of it, [being] doubled.
\[10]And they set in it four rows of stones: [the first] row [was] a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this [was] the first row.
\[11]And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.
\[12]And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.
\[13]And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: [they were] inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.
\[14]And the stones [were] according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, [like] the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.
\[15]And they made upon the breast-plate chains at the ends, [of] wreathed work [of] pure gold.
\[16]And they made two ouches [of] gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings in the two ends of the breast-plate.
\[17]And they put the two wreathed chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breast-plate.
\[18]And the two ends of the two wreathed chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, before it.
\[19]And they made two rings of gold, and put [them] on the two ends of the breast-plate, upon the border of it, which [was] on the side of the ephod inward.
\[20]And they made two [other] golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, towards the forepart of it, over against the [other] coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod:
\[21]And they bound the breast-plate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breast-plate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[22]And he made the robe of the ephod [of] woven work, all [of] blue.
\[23]And [there was] a hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, [with] a band around the hole, that it should not rend.
\[24]And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates [of] blue, and purple, and scarlet, [and] twined [linen].
\[25]And they made bells [of] pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, around between the pomegranates;
\[26]A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, around the hem of the robe to minister [in]; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[27]And they made coats [of] fine linen, [of] woven work, for Aaron and for his sons,
\[28]And a miter [of] fine linen, and goodly bonnets [of] fine linen, and linen breeches [of] fine twined linen,
\[29]And a girdle [of] fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, [of] needle-work; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[30]And they made the plate of the holy crown [of] pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, [like to] the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.
\[31]And they tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten [it] on high upon the miter; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[32]Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.
\[33]And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent, and all its furniture, its buttons, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets,
\[34]And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,
\[35]The ark of the testimony, and its staffs, and the mercy-seat,
\[36]The table, [and] all its vessels, and the show-bread,
\[37]The pure candlestick, [with] its lamps, [even with] the lamps to be set in order, and all its vessels, and the oil for light,
\[38]And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle-door,

\[41]The clothes of service to do service in the holy [place], and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.
\[42]According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work.

\[4]And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light its lamps.
\[5]And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.
\[6]And thou shalt set the altar of the, burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.
\[7]And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water in it.
\[8]And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court-gate.
\[9]And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that [is] in it, and shalt hallow it, and all its vessels: and it shall be holy.
\[10]And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt-offering and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.
\[11]And thou shalt anoint the laver and its foot, and sanctify it.
\[12]And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.
\[13]And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister to me in the priest's office.
\[14]And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:
\[15]And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister to me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.
\[16]Thus did Moses; according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.
\[17]And it came to pass in the first month, in the second year, on the first [day] of the month, [that] the tabernacle was reared up.
\[18]And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and reared up its pillars.
\[19]And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[20]And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staffs on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark:
\[21]And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[22]And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.
\[23]And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
\[24]And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.
\[25]And he lighted the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[26]And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation, before the vail:
\[27]And he burnt sweet incense on it; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[28]And he set up the hanging [at] the door of the tabernacle.
\[29]And he put the altar of burnt-offering [by] the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt-offering, and the meat-offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[30]And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash [with].
\[31]And Moses, and Aaron, and his sons, washed their hands and their feet thereat:
\[32]When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near to the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[33]And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court-gate: so Moses finished the work.
\[34]Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
\[35]And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
\[36]And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:
\[37]But if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.
\[38]For the cloud of the LORD [was] upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.

\[10]And he shall offer the second [for] a burnt-offering, according to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
\[11]But if he shall not be able to bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons; then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put [any] frankincense upon it: for it [is] a sin-offering.
\[12]Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, [even] a memorial of it, and burn [it] on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire to the LORD: it [is] a sin-offering.
\[13]And the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and [the remnant] shall be the priest's, as a meat-offering.
\[14]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[15]If a soul shall commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass to the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering:
\[16]And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add to it the fifth part, and give it to the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and it shall be forgiven him.
\[17]And if a soul shall sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he knew [it] not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.
\[18]And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass-offering to the priest; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and knew [it] not, and it shall be forgiven him.

\[16]And the remainder of it shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.
\[17]It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it [to them for] their portion of my offerings made by fire; It [is] most holy, as [is] the sin-offering, and as the trespass-offering.
\[18]All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. [It shall be] a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy.
\[19]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[20]This [is] the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat-offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half of it at night.

\[13]Besides the cakes, he shall offer [for] his offering, leavened bread, with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace-offerings.
\[14]And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation [for] a heave-offering to the LORD, [and] it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace-offerings.
\[15]And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.

\[24]And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used for any other purpose; but ye shall in no wise eat of it.
\[25]For whoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire to the LORD, even the soul that eateth [it] shall be cut off from his people.
\[26]Moreover, ye shall eat no manner of blood, [whether] of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.
\[27]Whatever soul [it may be] that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
\[28]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[29]Speak to the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace-offerings to the LORD, shall bring his oblation to the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings.
\[30]His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, that shall he bring, that the breast may be waved [for] a wave-offering before the LORD.
\[31]And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.
\[32]And the right shoulder shall ye give to the priest [for] a heave-offering of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings.
\[33]He among the sons' of Aaron that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for [his] part.
\[34]For the wave-breast and the heave-shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest, and to his sons, by a statute for ever, from among the children of Israel.
\[35]This [is the portion] of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day [when] he presented them to minister to the LORD in the priest's office;

\[4]And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[5]And Moses said to the congregation, This [is] the thing which the LORD commanded to be done.
\[6]And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
\[7]And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound [it] to him with it.
\[8]And he put the breast-plate upon him: also he put in the breast-plate the Urim and the Thummim.
\[9]And he put the miter upon his head; also upon the miter, [even] upon his front, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[10]And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that [was] in it, and sanctified them.
\[11]And he sprinkled part of it upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, both the laver and its foot, to sanctify them.
\[12]And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.
\[13]And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[14]And he brought the bullock for the sin-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin-offering.
\[15]And he slew [it]; and Moses took the blood, and put [it] upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.
\[16]And he took all the fat that [was] upon the inwards, and the caul [above] the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned [it] upon the altar.

\[19]And he killed [it]; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
\[20]And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.
\[21]And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it [was] a burnt-sacrifice for a sweet savor, [and] an offering made by fire to the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[22]And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

\[27]And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them [for] a wave-offering before the LORD.
\[28]And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt [them] on the altar upon the burnt-offering: they [were] consecrations for a sweet savor: it [is] an offering made by fire to the LORD.
\[29]And Moses took the breast, and waved it [for] a wave-offering before the LORD: [for] of the ram of consecration it was Moses's part; as the LORD commanded Moses.

\[37]And if [any part] of their carcass shall fall upon any sowing-seed which is to be sown, it [shall be] clean.
\[38]But if [any] water shall be put upon the seed, and [any part] of their carcass shall fall on it, it [shall be] unclean to you.
\[39]And if any beast, of which ye may eat, shall die; he that toucheth its carcass shall be unclean until the evening.
\[40]And he that eateth of its carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening; he also that beareth its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.
\[41]And every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth [shall be] an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
\[42]Whatever goeth upon the belly, and whatever goeth upon [all] four, or whatever hath more feet among all creeping animals that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they [are] an abomination.
\[43]Ye shall not make your selves abominable with any creeping animal that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled by them.
\[44]For I [am] the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I [am] holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth.
\[45]For I [am] the LORD that bringeth you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I [am] holy.
\[46]This [is] the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth;
\[47]To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.

\[2]When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh [like] the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests:
\[3]And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and [when] the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight [is] deeper than the skin of his flesh, it [is] a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.
\[4]If the bright spot [is] white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight, not deeper than the skin, and the hair of it not turned white; then the priest shall shut up [him that hath] the plague seven days:
\[5]And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and behold, [if] the plague in his sight is at a stay, [and] the plague spreadeth not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:
\[6]And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and behold, [if] the plague [is] somewhat dark, [and] the plague spreadeth not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it [is but] a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
\[7]But if the scab shall spread much in the skin, after he hath been seen by the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen by the priest again:
\[8]And [if] the priest shall see, that behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] a leprosy.
\[9]When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest:
\[10]And the priest shall see [him]: and behold, [if] the rising [is] white in the skin, and it hath turned the hair white, and [there is] raw flesh in the rising;
\[11]It [is] an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up; for he [is] unclean.
\[12]And if a leprosy shall break out in the skin, and the leprosy shall cover all the skin of [him that hath] the plague from his head even to his foot, wherever the priest looketh;
\[13]Then the priest shall consider: and behold, [if] the leprosy hath covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce [him] clean [that hath] the plague: it is all turned white: he [is] clean.
\[14]But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.
\[15]And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: [for] the raw flesh [is] unclean: it [is] a leprosy.
\[16]Or if the raw flesh shall turn again, and be changed into white, he shall come to the priest;
\[17]And the priest shall see him: and behold, [if] the plague is turned into white: then the priest shall pronounce [him] clean [that hath] the plague: he [is] clean.

\[20]And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it [is] in sight lower than the skin, and the hair of it [is] turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.
\[21]But if the priest shall look on it, and behold, [there are] no white hairs in it, and [if] it [is] not lower than the skin, but somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
\[22]And if it hath spread much in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] a plague.
\[23]But if the bright spot shall stay in its place, [and] not spread, it [is] a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
\[24]Or if there [is any] flesh, in the skin of which [there is] a hot burning, and the live [flesh] that burneth hath a white bright spot, somewhat reddish or white;
\[25]Then the priest shall look upon it: and behold, [if] the hair in the bright spot [is] turned white, and it [is in] sight deeper than the skin: it [is] a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] the plague of leprosy.

\[28]And if the bright spot shall stay in its place, [and] not spread in the skin, but [be] somewhat dark; it [is] a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it [is] an inflammation of the burning.

\[30]Then the priest shall see the plague: and behold, if it [is] in sight deeper than the skin, [and there is] in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] a dry scall, [even] a leprosy upon the head or beard.
\[31]And if the priest shall look on the plague of the scall, and behold, it [is] not in sight deeper than the skin, and no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up [him that hath] the plague of the scall seven days:
\[32]And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and behold, [if] the scall spreadeth not, and there is in it no yellow hair, and the scall [is] not in sight deeper than the skin;
\[33]He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up [him that hath] the scall seven days more:

\[41]And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head towards his face, he [is] forehead-bald; [yet is] he clean.

\[51]And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague is spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, [or] in a skin, [or] in any work that is made of skin: the plague [is] a fretting leprosy; it [is] unclean.
\[52]He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woolen or in linen, or any thing of skin, in which the plague is: for it [is] a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.
\[53]And if the priest shall look, and behold, the plague is not spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;
\[54]Then the priest shall command that they wash [the thing] in which the plague [is], and he shall shut it up seven days more:
\[55]And the priest shall look on the plague after it is washed: and behold, [if] the plague hath not changed its color, and the plague hath not spread; it [is] unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it [is] fret inward, [whether] it [is] bare within or without.
\[56]And if the priest shall look, and behold, the plague [is] somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:
\[57]And if it shall appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it [is] a spreading [plague]: thou shalt burn that in which the plague [is], with fire.
\[58]And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatever thing of skin [it is], which thou shalt wash, if the plague hath departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.
\[59]This [is] the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woolen or linen, either in the warp or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

\[4]Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive, [and] clean, and cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.
\[5]And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel, over running water.
\[6]As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar-wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them, and the living bird, in the blood of the bird [that was] killed over the running water.
\[7]And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.
\[8]And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.
\[9]But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head, and his beard, and his eye-brows, even all his hair he shall shave off; and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.
\[10]And on the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish, and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth-parts of fine flour [for] a meat-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.
\[11]And the priest that maketh [him] clean, shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[12]And the priest shall take one he-lamb, and offer him for a trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and wave them [for] a wave-offering before the LORD.
\[13]And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the holy-place: for as the sin-offering [is] the priest's, [so is] the trespass-offering: it [is] most holy.
\[14]And the priest shall take [some] of the blood of the trespass-offering, and the priest shall put [it] upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
\[15]And the priest shall take [some] of the log of oil, and pour [it] into the palm of his own left hand:
\[16]And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that [is] in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD.
\[17]And of the rest of the oil that [is] in his hand, shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass-offering.

\[40]Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague [is], and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:
\[41]And he shall cause the house to be scraped within on all sides, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:
\[42]And they shall take other stones, and put [them] in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.
\[43]And if the plague shall return, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plastered;
\[44]Then the priest shall come and look; and behold, [if] the plague is spread in the house, it [is] a fretting leprosy in the house: it [is] unclean.
\[45]And he shall break down the house, its stones, and its timber, and all the mortar of the house: and he shall carry [them] forth out of the city to an unclean place.
\[46]Moreover, he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up, shall be unclean until the evening.
\[47]And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes: and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.
\[48]And if the priest shall come in, and look [upon it], and behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plastered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
\[49]And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
\[50]And he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel, over running water:
\[51]And he shall take the cedar-wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:
\[52]And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:
\[53]But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.

\[55]And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,

\[4]He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with the linen girdle, and with the linen miter shall he be attired: these [are] holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and [so] put them on.
\[5]And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering.
\[6]And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin-offering, which [is] for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.
\[7]And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[8]And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scape-goat.
\[9]And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD'S lot fell, and offer him [for] a sin-offering.
\[10]But the goat on which the lot fell to be the scape-goat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, [and] to let him go for a scape-goat into the wilderness.
\[11]And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin-offering, which [is] for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which [is] for himself:
\[12]And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring [it] within the vail:
\[13]And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat that [is] upon the testimony, that he may not die.
\[14]And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle [it] with his finger upon the mercy-seat eastward: and before the mercy-seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.
\[15]Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-offering that [is] for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat:
\[16]And he shall make an atonement for the holy [place], because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
\[17]And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy [place], until he shall come out, and shall have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.
\[18]And he shall go out to the altar that [is] before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put [it] upon the horns of the altar round about.
\[19]And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.
\[20]And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy [place], and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat:
\[21]And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send [him] away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:
\[22]And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities to a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.
\[23]And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the holy [place], and shall leave them there:
\[24]And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy [place], and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt-offering, and the burnt-offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.
\[25]And the fat of the sin-offering shall he burn upon the altar.
\[26]And he that let go the goat for the scape-goat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.
\[27]And the bullock [for] the sin-offering, and the goat [for] the sin-offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy [place], shall [one] carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.
\[28]And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
\[29]And [this] shall be a statute for ever to you: [that] in the seventh month, on the tenth [day] of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, [whether it be] one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:
\[30]For on that day shall [the priest] make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, [that] ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.
\[31]It [shall be] a sabbath of rest to you, and ye shall afflict your souls by a statute for ever.
\[32]And the priest whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, [even] the holy garments:
\[33]And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar: and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.
\[34]And this shall be an everlasting statute to you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.

\[4]And bringeth it not to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering to the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed to that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:
\[5]To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them to the LORD, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest, and offer them [for] peace-offerings to the LORD.
\[6]And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savor to the LORD.
\[7]And they shall no more offer their sacrifices to idols, with which they have committed idolatry: This shall be a statute for ever to them throughout their generations.
\[8]And thou shalt say to them, Whatever man [there may be] of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt-offering or sacrifice,
\[9]And bringeth it not to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it to the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.

\[11]For the life of the flesh [is] in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar, to make an atonement for your souls: for it [is] the blood [that] maketh an atonement for the soul.
\[12]Therefore I said to the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.
\[13]And whatever man [there may be] of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, who hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out its blood, and cover it with dust.
\[14]For [it is] the life of all flesh, the blood of it [is] for the life of it; therefore I said to the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh [is] its blood: whoever eateth it shall be cut off.
\[15]And every soul that eateth that which died [of itself], or that which was torn [with beasts], ([whether it is] one of your own country, or a stranger) he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean until the evening; then shall he be clean.

\[27]When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire to the LORD.
\[28]And [whether it is] cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.
\[29]And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, offer it at your own will.
\[30]On the same day it shall be eaten up, ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I [am] the LORD.
\[31]Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I [am] the LORD.
\[32]Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I [am] the LORD who hallow you,
\[33]That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I [am] the LORD.

\[2]Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, [Concerning] the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim [to be] holy convocations, [even] these [are] my feasts.
\[3]Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day [is] the sabbath of rest, a holy convocation: ye shall do no work [in it]: it [is] the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.
\[4]These [are] the feasts of the LORD, holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.
\[5]In the fourteenth [day] of the first month at evening [is] the LORD'S passover.
\[6]And on the fifteenth day of the same month [is] the feast of unleavened bread to the LORD, seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.
\[7]In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work in it.
\[8]But ye shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD seven days: in the seventh day [is] a holy convocation, ye shall do no servile work [in it].
\[9]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[10]Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye shall have come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest to the priest:
\[11]And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
\[12]And ye shall offer, that day when ye wave the sheaf, a he-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt-offering to the LORD.
\[13]And the meat-offering thereof [shall be] two tenth-parts of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire to the LORD [for] a sweet savor: and the drink-offering thereof [shall be] of wine, the fourth [part] of a hin.
\[14]And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the same day that ye have brought an offering to your God: [It shall be] a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
\[15]And ye shall count to you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:
\[16]Even to the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat-offering to the LORD.
\[17]Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves of two tenth-parts: they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with leaven, [they are] the first-fruits to the LORD.
\[18]And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be [for] a burnt-offering to the LORD, with their meat-offering, and their drink offerings, [even] an offering made by fire of a sweet savor to the LORD.
\[19]Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.
\[20]And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits [for] a wave-offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.
\[21]And ye shall proclaim on the same day, [that] it may be a holy convocation to you: ye shall do no servile work [in it]. [it shall be] a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
\[22]And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them to the poor, and to the stranger: I [am] the LORD your God.

\[25]Ye shall do no servile work [in it]; but ye shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.
\[26]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[27]Also on the tenth [day] of this seventh month [there shall be] a day of atonement; it shall be a holy convocation to you, and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.
\[28]And ye shall do no work in that same day; for it [is] a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.
\[29]For whatever soul [it may be] that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.
\[30]And whatever soul [it may be] that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.
\[31]Ye shall do no manner of work. [It shall be] a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
\[32]It [shall be] to you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls in the ninth [day] of the month at evening: from evening to evening shall ye celebrate your sabbath.
\[33]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[34]Speak to the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month [shall be] the feast of tabernacles [for] seven days to the LORD.
\[35]On the first day [shall be] a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work [in it].
\[36]Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation to you, and ye shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: it [is] a solemn assembly; [and] ye shall do no servile work [in it].
\[37]These [are] the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim [to be] holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to the LORD, a burnt-offering, and a meat-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, every thing upon its day:
\[38]Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your free-will-offerings, which ye give to the LORD.
\[39]Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days: on the first day [shall be] a sabbath, and on the eighth day [shall be] a sabbath.
\[40]And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.
\[41]And ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD seven days in the year. [It shall be] a statute for ever in your generations; ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
\[42]Ye shall dwell in booths seven days: all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:
\[43]That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I [am] the LORD your God.

\[5]And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it: two tenth-parts shall be in one cake.

\[10]And the son of an Israelitish woman whose father [was] an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and this son of the Israelitish [woman] and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;
\[11]And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name [of the LORD], and cursed: and they brought him to Moses: (and his mother's name [was] Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)
\[12]And they put him in custody, that the mind of the LORD might be shown to them.

\[14]Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard [him] lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
\[15]And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel, saying, Whoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
\[16]And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, [and] all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name [of the LORD], shall be put to death.
\[17]And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.
\[18]And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.
\[19]And if a man shall cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;
\[20]Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him.
\[21]And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.
\[22]Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I [am] the LORD your God.

\[2]Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath to the LORD.
\[3]Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;
\[4]But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest to the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
\[5]That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest, thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: [for] it is a year of rest to the land.
\[6]And the sabbath of the land shall be food for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,
\[7]And for thy cattle, and for the beast that [are] in thy land, shall all the increase of it be food.
\[8]And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years to thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be to thee forty and nine years.
\[9]Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound, on the tenth [day] of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
\[10]And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout [all] the land to all its inhabitants: it shall be a jubilee to you; and ye shall return every man to his possession, and ye shall return every man to his family.
\[11]A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be to you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather [the grapes] in it of thy vine undressed.
\[12]For it [is] the jubilee; it shall be holy to you: ye shall eat the increase of it out of the field.
\[13]In the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man to his possession.
\[14]And if thou shalt sell aught to thy neighbor, or buy [aught] of thy neighbor's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:
\[15]According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbor, [and] according to the number of years of the fruits he shall sell to thee:
\[16]According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price of it, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for [according] to the number [of the years] of the fruits doth he sell to thee.
\[17]Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I [am] the LORD your God.
\[18]Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
\[19]And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell in it in safety.
\[20]And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow nor gather in our increase:
\[21]Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.
\[22]And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of old fruit until the ninth year; until its fruits come in ye shall eat [of] the old [store].
\[23]The land shall not be sold for ever; for the land [is] mine, for ye [are] strangers and sojourners with me.
\[24]And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
\[25]If thy brother shall have become poor, and have sold [some] of his possession, and if any of his kin shall come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.
\[26]And if the man shall have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;
\[27]Then let him count the years of the sale of it, and restore the overplus to the man to whom he sold it; that he may return to his possession.
\[28]But if he shall not be able to restore [it] to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.
\[29]And if a man shall sell a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold: [within] a full year may he redeem it.
\[30]And if it shall not be redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that [is] in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubilee,
\[31]But the houses of the villages which have no walls around them, shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.
\[32]Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, [and] the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.
\[33]And if a man shall purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession shall go out in the [year of] jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites [are] their possession among the children of Israel.
\[34]But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold, for it [is] their perpetual possession.
\[35]And if thy brother shall have become poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: [yea, though he] may [be] a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.
\[36]Take thou no interest of him, or increase; but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
\[37]Thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.
\[38]I [am] the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, [and] to be your God.
\[39]And if thy brother [that dwelleth] by thee shall have become poor, and be sold to thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bond servant:
\[40][But] as a hired servant, [and] as a sojourner he shall be with thee, [and] shall serve thee to the year of jubilee.
\[41]And [then] shall he depart from thee, [both] he and his children with him, and shall return to his own family, and to the possession of his fathers shall he return.
\[42]For they [are] my servants, which I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as bond-men.
\[43]Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor, but shalt fear thy God.
\[44]Both thy bond-men, and thy bond-maids, which thou shalt have, [shall be] of the heathen that are around you; of them shall ye buy bond-men and bond-maids.
\[45]Moreover of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.
\[46]And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit [them for] a possession, they shall be your bond-men for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigor.
\[47]And if a sojourner or a stranger shall become rich by thee, and thy brother [that dwelleth] by him shall become poor, and sell himself to the stranger [or] sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:
\[48]After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:
\[49]Either his uncle, or his uncle's son may redeem him, or [any] that is nigh of kin to him of his family, may redeem him; or if he is able, he may redeem himself.
\[50]And he shall reckon with him that bought him, from the year that he was sold to him, to the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, according to the time of a hired servant shall it be with him.
\[51]If [there shall be] yet many years [behind], according to them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
\[52]And if there shall remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him, [and] according to his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.
\[53][And] as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: [and the other] shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.
\[54]And if he shall not be redeemed in these [years], then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, [both] he, and his children with him.
\[55]For to me the children of Israel [are] servants, they [are] my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt: I [am] the LORD your God.

\[42]Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
\[43]The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.
\[44]And yet for all that, when they shall be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I [am] the LORD their God.

\[3]And thy estimation shall be, of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
\[4]And if it [shall be] a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
\[5]And if [it shall be] from five years old even to twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
\[6]And if [it shall be] from a month old even to five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation [shall be] three shekels of silver.
\[7]And if [it shall be] from sixty years old and above; if a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
\[8]But if he shall be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him: according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.
\[9]And if [it shall be] a beast of which men bring an offering to the LORD, all that [any man] giveth of such to the LORD shall be holy.
\[10]He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange of it shall be holy.
\[11]And if [it shall be] any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice to the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:
\[12]And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, [who art] the priest, so shall it be.
\[13]But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth [part] of it to thy estimation.
\[14]And when a man shall sanctify his house [to be] holy to the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it is good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
\[15]And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth [part] of the money of thy estimation to it, and it shall be his.
\[16]And if a man shall sanctify to the LORD [some part] of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed of it: a homer of barley seed [shall be valued] at fifty shekels of silver.
\[17]If he shall sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
\[18]But if he shall sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain, even to the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.
\[19]And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth [part] of the money of thy estimation to it, and it shall be assured to him.
\[20]And if he will not redeem the field, or if he shall have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
\[21]But the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a field devoted: the possession of it shall be the priest's.
\[22]And if [a man] shall sanctify to the LORD a field which he hath bought, which [is] not of the fields of his possession;
\[23]Then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of thy estimation, [even] to the year of the jubilee, and he shall give thy estimation in that day, [as] a holy thing to the LORD.

\[28]Notwithstanding, no devoted thing that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he hath, [both] of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.
\[29]None devoted, which shall be devoted by men, shall be redeemed: [but] shall surely be put to death.
\[30]And all the tithe of the land, [whether] of the seed of the land, [or] of the fruit of the tree, [is] the LORD'S: [it is] holy to the LORD.
\[31]And if a man will at all redeem [aught] of his tithes, he shall add to it the fifth [part] of it.
\[32]And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, [even] of whatever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD.
\[33]He shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he shall change it at all, then both it and the change of it shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
\[34]These [are] the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.

\[11]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[12]Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, If any man's wife shall go astray, and commit a trespass against him,
\[13]And a man shall lie with her carnally, and it shall be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and [there be] no witness against her, neither she be taken [with the manner];
\[14]And the spirit of jealousy shall come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy shall come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:
\[15]Then shall the man bring his wife to the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth [part] of an ephah of barley-meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense upon it; for it [is] an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
\[16]And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:
\[17]And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put [it] into the water:
\[18]And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which [is] the jealousy-offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse:
\[19]And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say to the woman, If no man hath lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness [with another] instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:
\[20]But if thou hast gone aside [to another] instead of thy husband, and if thou art defiled, and some man hath lain with thee besides thy husband:
\[21]Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say to the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to perish, and thy belly to swell;
\[22]And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make [thy] belly to swell, and [thy] thigh to perish. And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.
\[23]And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot [them] out with the bitter water:
\[24]And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, [and become] bitter.
\[25]Then the priest shall take the jealousy-offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar:
\[26]And the priest shall take a handful of the offering, [even] the memorial of it, and burn [it] upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.
\[27]And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, [that], if she is defiled, and hath done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, [and become] bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall perish: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.
\[28]And if the woman is not defiled, but is clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.
\[29]This [is] the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth astray [to another] instead of her husband, and is defiled;
\[30]Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he is jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.
\[31]Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.

\[2]Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When either man or woman shall separate [themselves] to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate [themselves] to the LORD.
\[3]He shall separate [himself] from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.
\[4]All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine-tree, from the kernels even to the husk.
\[5]All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days shall be fulfilled, in which he separateth [himself] to the LORD, he shall be holy, [and] shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.
\[6]All the days that he separateth [himself] to the LORD, he shall come at no dead body.
\[7]He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God [is] upon his head.
\[8]All the days of his separation he [is] holy to the LORD.
\[9]And if any man shall die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.
\[10]And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
\[11]And the priest shall offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.
\[12]And he shall consecrate to the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass-offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.
\[13]And this [is] the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
\[14]And he shall offer his offering to the LORD, one he-lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for peace-offerings,
\[15]And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat-offering and their drink-offerings.
\[16]And the priest shall bring [them] before the LORD, and shall offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering:
\[17]And he shall offer the ram [for] a sacrifice of peace-offerings to the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat-offering, and his drink-offering.
\[18]And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put [it] in the fire which [is] under the sacrifice of the peace-offerings.
\[19]And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put [them] upon the hands of the Nazarite, after [the hair of] his separation is shaven:
\[20]And the priest shall wave them [for] a wave-offering before the LORD: this [is] holy for the priest, with the wave-breast, and heave-shoulder: and after that, the Nazarite may drink wine.
\[21]This [is] the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, [and of] his offering to the LORD for his separation, besides [that] which his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation.

\[24]The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:
\[25]The LORD make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious to thee:

\[8]Then let them take a young bullock with his meat-offering, [even] fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin-offering.
\[9]And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt convene the whole assembly of the children of Israel:
\[10]And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:
\[11]And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD [for] an offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the LORD.

\[15]And after that shall the Levites go in to perform the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them [for] an offering.
\[16]For they [are] wholly given to me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, [even instead of] the first-born of all the children of Israel, have I taken them to me.
\[17]For all the first born of the children of Israel [are] mine, [both] man and beast: on the day that I smote every first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.

\[19]And I have given the Levites [as] a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there may be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh to the sanctuary.

\[7]And those men said to him, We [are] defiled by the dead body of a man: why are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in its appointed season among the children of Israel?
\[8]And Moses said to them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.
\[9]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[10]Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or [be] in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover to the LORD.
\[11]The fourteenth day of the second month at evening, they shall keep it, [and] eat it with unleavened bread and bitter [herbs].
\[12]They shall leave none of it to the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.
\[13]But the man that [is] clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
\[14]And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover to the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner of it, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.
\[15]And on the day that the tabernacle was erected the cloud covered the tabernacle, [namely], the tent of the testimony: and at evening there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.

\[17]And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.
\[18]At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.

\[22]And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim moved forward according to their armies: and over his host [was] Elishama the son of Ammihud.
\[23]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh [was] Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
\[24]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin [was] Abidan the son of Gideoni.
\[25]And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan moved forward, [which was] the rear-ward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and over his host [was] Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
\[26]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher [was] Pagiel the son of Ocran.
\[27]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali [was] Ahira the son of Enan.
\[28]Thus [were] the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they moved forward.
\[29]And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses's father-in-law, We are journeying to the place of which the LORD said, I will give it to you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.
\[30]And he said to him, I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my kindred.
\[31]And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.
\[32]And it shall be, if thou wilt go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do to us, the same will we do to thee.
\[33]And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to seek a resting-place for them.
\[34]And the cloud of the LORD [was] upon them by day, when they went out of the camp.
\[35]And it came to pass, when the ark moved forward, that Moses said, Arise, LORD, and let thy enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.
\[36]And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, to the many thousands of Israel.

nd [when] the people complained, it displeased the LORD; and the LORD heard [it]: and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed [them that were] in the uttermost parts of the camp.
\[2]And the people cried to Moses; and when Moses prayed to the LORD, the fire was quenched.
\[3]And he called the name of the place Taberah; because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.
\[4]And the mixed multitude that [was] among them fell to lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?
\[5]We remember the fish which we ate in Egypt freely: the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:
\[6]But now our soul [is] dried away; [there is] nothing at all, besides this manna, [before] our eyes.
\[7]And the manna [was] as coriander-seed, and the color of it as the color of bdellium.
\[8][And] the people went about, and gathered [it] and ground [it] in mills, or beat [it] in a mortar, and baked [it] in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
\[9]And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.
\[10]Then Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly: Moses also was displeased.
\[11]And Moses said to the LORD, Why hast thou afflicted thy servant? and why have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?
\[12]Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say to me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father beareth the sucking child, to the land which thou sworest to their fathers?
\[13]Whence should I have flesh to give to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.
\[14]I am not able to bear all this people alone, because [it is] too heavy for me.
\[15]And if thou dealest thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.
\[16]And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee.
\[17]And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which [is] upon thee, and will put [it] upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou mayest not bear it thyself alone.
\[18]And say thou to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for [it was] well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.
\[19]Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;
\[20][But] even a whole month, until it shall come out at your nostrils, and it be lothsome to you; because ye have despised the LORD who [is] among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?
\[21]And Moses said, The people among whom I [am], [are] six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.
\[22]Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice for them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered for them, to suffice for them?
\[23]And the LORD said to Moses, Is the LORD'S hand shortened? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass to thee, or not.
\[24]And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the tabernacle.
\[25]And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that [was] upon him, and gave [it] to the seventy elders: and it came to pass, [that] when the spirit rested upon them; they prophesied, and did not cease.
\[26]But there remained two [of the] men in the camp, the name of the one [was] Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them, and they [were] of them that were described, but went not out to the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.
\[27]And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.
\[28]And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, [one] of his young men, answered and said, My lord, Moses, forbid them.
\[29]And Moses said to him, Enviest thou for my sake? I would that all the LORD'S people were prophets, [and] that the LORD would put his spirit upon them.
\[30]And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
\[31]And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let [them] fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, around the camp, and as it were two cubits [high] upon the face of the earth.
\[32]And the people stood up all that day, and all [that] night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread [them] all abroad for themselves around the camp.
\[33]And while the flesh [was] yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.
\[34]And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.
\[35][And] the people journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah to Hazeroth: and abode at Hazeroth.

\[2]And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoke only by Moses? hath he not spoke also by us? And the LORD heard [it].
\[3](Now the man Moses [was] very meek, above all the men who [were] upon the face of the earth.)
\[4]And the LORD spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, Come out ye three to the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.
\[5]And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood [in] the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.
\[6]And he said, Hear now my words: If there is a prophet among you, [I] the LORD will make myself known to him in a vision, [and] will speak to him in a dream.
\[7]My servant Moses [is] not so, who [is] faithful in all my house.
\[8]With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?
\[9]And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.
\[10]And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and behold, Miriam [became] leprous, [white] as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and behold, [she was] leprous.
\[11]And Aaron said to Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.
\[12]Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed at the time of his birth.
\[13]And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.
\[14]And the LORD said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received [again].
\[15]And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in [again].

\[2]Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.
\[3]And Moses, by the commandment of the LORD, sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men [were] heads of the children of Israel.
\[4]And these [were] their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.
\[5]Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
\[6]Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
\[7]Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
\[8]Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.
\[9]Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
\[10]Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
\[11]Of the tribe of Joseph, [namely], of the tribe of Manassah, Gaddi the son of Susi.
\[12]Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
\[13]Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
\[14]Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
\[15]Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
\[16]These [are] the names of the men whom Moses sent to explore the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.
\[17]And Moses sent them to explore the land of Canaan, and said to them, Go ye up this [way] southward, and ascend the mountain:
\[18]And see the land, what it [is]; and the people that dwell therein, whether they [are] strong or weak, few or many;
\[19]And what the land [is] that they dwell in, whether it [is] good or bad; and what cities [they are] that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;
\[20]And what the land [is], whether it [is] fertile or barren, whether there is wood in it, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time [was] the time of the first ripe grapes.
\[21]So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, as men come to Hamath.
\[22]And they ascended by the south, and came to Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, [were]. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
\[23]And they came to the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it between two upon a staff; and [they brought] of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
\[24]The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.
\[25]And they returned from exploring the land after forty days.
\[26]And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
\[27]And they told him, and said, We came to the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this [is] the fruit of it.
\[28]Nevertheless, the people [are] strong that dwell in the land, and the cities [are] walled, [and] very great: and moreover, we saw the children of Anak there.
\[29]The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.
\[30]And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
\[31]But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they [are] stronger than we.
\[32]And they brought an evil report of the land which they had searched to the children of Israel, saying, The land through which we have passed to search it, [is] a land that eateth up its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it, [are] men of a great stature.
\[33]And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, [who come] of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.

nd all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.
\[2]And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said to them, O that we had died in the land of Egypt! or O that we had died in this wilderness!
\[3]And why hath the LORD brought us to this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?
\[4]And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
\[5]Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
\[6]And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, [who were] of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:
\[7]And they spoke to all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, [is] an exceeding good land.
\[8]If the LORD delighteth in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.
\[9]Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they [are] bread for us: their defense has departed from them, and the LORD [is] with us: fear them not.
\[10]But all the congregation required to stone them with stones: and the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.
\[11]And the LORD said to Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shown among them?
\[12]I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.
\[13]And Moses said to the LORD, Then the Egyptians will hear [it], (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)
\[14]And they will tell [it] to the inhabitants of this land: [for] they have heard that thou LORD [art] among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and [that] thy cloud standeth over them, and [that] thou goest before them, by day-time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.
\[15]Now [if] thou shalt kill [all] this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,
\[16]Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.
\[17]And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,
\[18]The LORD [is] long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth [generation].
\[19]Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt, even until now.
\[20]And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:
\[21]But [as] truly [as] I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.
\[22]Because all those men who have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;
\[23]Surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:
\[24]But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land into which he went; and his seed shall possess it.
\[25](Now the Amalekites, and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To-morrow turn you, and pass into the wilderness, by the way of the Red sea.
\[26]And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
\[27]How long [shall I bear with] this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.
\[28]Say to them, [As truly as] I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you:
\[29]Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me,
\[30]Doubtless ye shall not come into the land [concerning] which I swore to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
\[31]But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.
\[32]But [as for] you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness.
\[33]And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your lewd deeds, until your carcasses shall be wasted in the wilderness.
\[34]After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, [even] forty days (each day for a year) shall ye bear your iniquities, [even] forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.
\[35]I the LORD have said, I will surely do it to all this evil congregation, that are gathered against me: in this wilderness, they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.
\[36]And the men whom Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing a slander upon the land,
\[37]Even those men that brought the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.
\[38]But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, [who were] of the men that went to search the land, lived [still].
\[39]And Moses told these sayings to all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.
\[40]And they rose early in the morning, and ascended to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we [are here], and will go up to the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.
\[41]And Moses said, Why now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.
\[42]Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.
\[43]For the Amalekites and the Canaanites [are] there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.
\[44]But they presumed to go up to the hill-top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.
\[45]Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, [even] to Hormah.

\[19]Then it shall be, that when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up a heave-offering to the LORD.
\[20]Ye shall offer a cake of the first of your dough [for] a heave-offering: as [ye do] the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it.
\[21]Of the first of your dough ye shall give to the LORD a heave-offering in your generations.

\[28]And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.

\[2]And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:
\[3]And they assembled themselves against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, [Ye take] too much upon you, seeing all the congregation [are] holy, every one of them, and the LORD [is] among them: why then do ye raise yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?
\[4]And when Moses heard [it], he fell upon his face:
\[5]And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, Even to-morrow the LORD will show who [are] his, and [who is] holy; and will cause [him] to come near to him: even [him] whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near to him.

\[7]And put fire in them, and put incense in them before the LORD to-morrow: and it shall be [that] the man whom the LORD doth choose, he [shall be] holy: [ye take] too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.

\[12]And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: who said, We will not come up:
\[13][Is it] a small thing that thou hast brought us out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?
\[14]Moreover, thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.

\[17]And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also and Aaron each [of you] his censer.

\[19]And Korah gathered all the congregation against them to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.
\[20]And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
\[21]Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
\[22]And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?
\[23]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[24]Speak to the congregation, saying, Withdraw yourselves from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
\[25]And Moses rose up, and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
\[26]And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.
\[27]So they withdrew from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.
\[28]And Moses said, by this ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works: for [I have] not [done them] of my own mind.
\[29]If these men shall die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; [then] the LORD hath not sent me.
\[30]But if the LORD shall make a new thing, and the earth shall open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that [appertain] to them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.
\[31]And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground cleaved asunder that [was] under them:
\[32]And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that [appertained] to Korah, and [all their] goods.
\[33]They, and all that [appertained] to them went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.
\[34]And all Israel that [were] round about them, fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up [also].
\[35]And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.
\[36]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[37]Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.
\[38]The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates [for] a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.
\[39]And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, with which they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad [plates for] a covering of the altar:
\[40][To be] a memorial to the children of Israel, that no stranger, who [is] not of the seed of Aaron, should come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he may not be as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.
\[41]But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD.
\[42]And it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked towards the tabernacle of the congregation: and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.
\[43]And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[44]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[45]Remove from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.
\[46]And Moses said to Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire in it from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly to the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.
\[47]And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.
\[48]And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
\[49]Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah.
\[50]And Aaron returned to Moses at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.

\[3]And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod [shall be] for the head of the house of their fathers.
\[4]And thou shalt lay them in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.

\[6]And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, [even] twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron [was] among their rods.
\[7]And Moses laid the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.
\[8]And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.
\[9]And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD to all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.
\[10]And the LORD said to Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again, before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.
\[11]And Moses did [so]: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.
\[12]And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.

\[2]And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined to thee, and minister to thee: but thou and thy sons with thee [shall minister] before the tabernacle of witness.
\[3]And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.
\[4]And they shall be joined to thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh to you.
\[5]And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.
\[6]And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you [they are] given [as] a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[7]Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office for every thing of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office [to you as] a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
\[8]And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.
\[9]This shall be thine of the most holy things [reserved] from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render to me, [shall be] most holy for thee and for thy sons.
\[10]In the most holy [place] shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy to thee.
\[11]And this [is] thine; the heave-offering of their gift, with all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them to thee, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.
\[12]All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first-fruits of them which they shall offer to the LORD, them have I given to thee.

\[26]Thus speak to the Levites, and say to them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for the LORD, [even] a tenth [part] of the tithe.
\[27]And [this] your heave-offering shall be reckoned to you, as though [it were] the corn of the threshing-floor, and as the fullness of the wine-press.
\[28]Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering to the LORD of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give of them the LORD'S heave-offering to Aaron the priest.
\[29]Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of the LORD, of all the best of it, [even] its hallowed part out of it.
\[30]Therefore thou shalt say to them, When ye have heaved from it the best of it, then it shall be counted to the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press.
\[31]And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it [is] your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[32]And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.

\[3]And the people chid with Moses, and spoke, saying, O that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!
\[4]And why have ye brought the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?
\[5]And why have ye conducted us from Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? it [is] no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither [is] there any water to drink.

\[10]And Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?

\[15]How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians afflicted us, and our fathers:
\[16]And when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth from Egypt: and behold, we [are] in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:
\[17]Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink [of] the water of the wells: we will go by the king's [high]-way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.
\[18]And Edom said to him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.
\[19]And the children of Israel said to him, We will go by the highway: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without [doing] any thing [else], go through on my feet.
\[20]And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand.

\[3]And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.
\[4]And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
\[5]And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have ye brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for [there is] no bread, neither [is there any] water; and our soul lotheth this light bread.
\[6]And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many people of Israel died.
\[7]Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
\[8]And the LORD said to Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.

\[10]And the children of Israel moved forward, and pitched in Oboth.
\[11]And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which [is] before Moab, towards the sun-rising.
\[12]From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.
\[13]From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which [is] in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon [is] the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.

\[15]And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.
\[16]And from thence [they went] to Beer: that [is] the well of which the LORD spoke to Moses, Assemble the people, and I will give them water.
\[17]Then Israel sung this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye to it:
\[18]The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by [the direction of] the lawgiver, with their staffs. And from the wilderness [they went] to Mattanah:
\[19]And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
\[20]And from Bamoth [in] the valley, that [is] in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh towards Jeshimon.
\[21]And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
\[22]Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink [of] the waters of the well: [but] we will go along by the king's [high]-way, until we have past thy borders.
\[23]And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon collected all his people, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel:
\[24]And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon [was] strong.
\[25]And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.
\[26]For Heshbon [was] the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.
\[27]Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared.
\[28]For there has a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, [and] the lords of the high places of Arnon.
\[29]Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.
\[30]We have shot at them; Heshbon has perished even to Dibon, and we have laid them waste even to Nophah, which [reacheth] to Medeba.
\[31]Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
\[32]And Moses sent to explore Jaazer, and they took its villages, and drove out the Amorites that [were] there.
\[33]And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.
\[34]And the LORD said to Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.

\[6]Come now therefore, I pray thee, Curse for me this people; for they [are] too mighty for me: it may be I shall prevail, [that] we may smite them, and [that] I may drive them out of the land: for I know that he whom thou blessest [is] blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.

\[11]Behold, [there has] a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse them for me: it may be I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.
\[12]And God said to Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they [are] blessed.
\[13]And Balaam rose in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, Depart into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.
\[14]And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.
\[15]And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.

\[17]For I will promote thee to very great honor, and I will do whatever thou sayest to me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse this people for me.
\[18]And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.
\[19]Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say to me more.
\[20]And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men come to call thee, rise [and] go with them; but yet the word which I shall say to thee, that shalt thou perform.
\[21]And Balaam rose in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
\[22]And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants [were] with him.
\[23]And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.
\[24]But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall [being] on this side, and a wall on that side.
\[25]And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself against the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.
\[26]And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where [was] no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
\[27]And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.
\[28]And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?
\[29]And Balaam said to the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in my hand, for now would I kill thee.
\[30]And the ass said to Balaam, [Am] not I thy ass, upon which thou hast rid ever since [I was] thine to this day? was I ever wont to do so to thee? And he said, Nay.
\[31]Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.
\[32]And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why hast thou smitten thy ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because [thy] way is perverse before me:
\[33]And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.
\[34]And Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displeaseth thee, I will return again.
\[35]And the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak to thee, that thou shalt speak: So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
\[36]And when Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to a city of Moab, which [is] in the border of Arnon, which [is] in the utmost limit.
\[37]And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to thee to call thee? why camest thou not to me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor?
\[38]And Balaam said to Balak, Lo, I have come to thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.

\[4]And God met Balaam: and he said to him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon [every] altar a bullock and a ram.

\[6]And he returned to him and lo, he stood by his burnt-sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.
\[7]And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, [saying], Come, curse Jacob for me, and come, defy Israel.
\[8]How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, [whom] the LORD hath not defied?
\[9]For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
\[10]Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth [part] of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!
\[11]And Balak said to Balaam, What hast thou done to me? I took thee to curse my enemies, and behold, thou hast blessed [them] altogether.
\[12]And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?
\[13]And Balak said to him, Come, I pray thee, with me to another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and from thence curse them for me.
\[14]And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on [every] altar.
\[15]And he said to Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I meet [the LORD] yonder.
\[16]And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again to Balak, and say thus.
\[17]And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, What hath the LORD spoken?
\[18]And he took up his parable, and said, Rise, Balak, and hear; hearken to me, thou son of Zippor:
\[19]God [is] not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do [it]? or hath he spoke, and shall he not make it good?
\[20]Behold, I have received [commandment] to bless: and he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.
\[21]He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel; the LORD his God [is] with him, and the shout of a king [is] among them.
\[22]God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn.
\[23]Surely [there is] no enchantment against Jacob, neither [is there] any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!
\[24]Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he shall eat [of] the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.
\[25]And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
\[26]But Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not tell thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?
\[27]And Balak said to Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee to another place; perhaps it will please God that thou mayest from thence curse them for me.
\[28]And Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor, that looketh towards Jeshimon.
\[29]And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

\[3]And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:
\[4]He hath said, who heard the words of God, who saw the vision of the Almighty, falling [into a trance], but having his eyes open:
\[5]How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, [and] thy tabernacles, O Israel!

\[11]Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee to great honor; but lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honor.
\[12]And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not speak also to thy messengers whom thou sentest to me, saying,
\[13]If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do [either] good or bad of my own mind; [but] what the LORD saith, that will I speak?
\[14]And now, behold, I go to my people: come [therefore], I will advertise thee what this people will do to thy people in the latter days.

\[16]He hath said, who heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the Most High, [who] saw the vision of the Almighty, falling [into a trance], but having his eyes open:
\[17]I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.
\[18]And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.
\[19]Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.
\[20]And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek [was] the first of the nations, but his latter end [shall be] that he shall perish for ever.
\[21]And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwelling-place, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.
\[22]Nevertheless, the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asher shall carry thee away captive.

nd Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This [is] the thing which the LORD hath commanded.
\[2]If a man shall vow a vow to the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.
\[3]If a woman also shall vow a vow to the LORD, and bind [herself] by a bond, [being] in her father's house in her youth;
\[4]And her father shall hear her vow, and her bond with which she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she hath bound her soul shall stand.
\[5]But if her father shall disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows or of her bonds with which she hath bound her soul shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
\[6]And if she had a husband when she vowed, or uttered aught from her lips, with which she bound her soul;
\[7]And her husband heard [it], and held his peace at her in the day that he heard [it]: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she bound her soul shall stand.
\[8]But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard [it]; then he shall make of no effect her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, with which she bound her soul: and the LORD shall forgive her.
\[9]But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, with which they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.
\[10]And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;
\[11]And her husband heard [it], and held his peace at her, [and] disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand.
\[12]But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard [them]; [then] whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.
\[13]Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
\[14]But if her husband altogether holds his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which [are] upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard [them].
\[15]But if he shall any way make them void after that he hath heard [them]; then he shall bear her iniquity.
\[16]These [are] the statutes which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, [being yet] in her youth in her father's house.

nd the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[2]Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered to thy people.
\[3]And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves for the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD on Midian.
\[4]Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.
\[5]So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of [every] tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
\[6]And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of [every] tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.
\[7]And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.
\[8]And they slew the kings of Midian, besides the rest of them that were slain; [namely], Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
\[9]And the children of Israel took [all] the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.
\[10]And they burnt all their cities in which they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.
\[11]And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, [both] of men and of beasts.
\[12]And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which [are] by Jordan [near] Jericho.
\[13]And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.
\[14]And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, [with] the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, who came from the battle.
\[15]And Moses said to them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
\[16]Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD, in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.
\[17]Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.
\[18]But all the female children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
\[19]And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whoever hath killed any person, and whoever hath touched any slain, purify [both] yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.
\[20]And purify all [your] raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' [hair], and all things made of wood.
\[21]And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, This [is] the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses;
\[22]Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
\[23]Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make [it] go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water.
\[24]And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.
\[25]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[26]Take the sum of the prey that was taken, [both] of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:
\[27]And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:
\[28]And levy a tribute to the LORD of the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, [both] of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:
\[29]Take [it] of their half, and give [it] to Eleazar the priest, [for] a heave-offering of the LORD.
\[30]And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them to the Levites, who keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.
\[31]And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[32]And the booty, [being] the rest of the prey which the men of war had taken, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
\[33]And seventy two thousand beeves,
\[34]And sixty one thousand asses,
\[35]And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.
\[36]And the half [which was] the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:
\[37]And the LORD'S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and seventy five.
\[38]And the beeves [were] thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD'S tribute [was] seventy two.
\[39]And the asses [were] thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD'S tribute [was] sixty one.
\[40]And the persons [were] sixteen thousand, of which the LORD'S tribute [was] thirty and two persons.
\[41]And Moses gave the tribute, [which was] the LORD'S heave-offering, to Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[42]And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,
\[43](Now the half [that pertained to] the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand [and] seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
\[44]And thirty and six thousand beeves,
\[45]And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,
\[46]And sixteen thousand persons;)
\[47]Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, [both] of man and of beast, and gave them to the Levites, who kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[48]And the officers who [were] over thousands of the hosts, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near to Moses:
\[49]And they said to Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war who [are] under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.
\[50]We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath obtained of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, ear-rings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.
\[51]And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, [even] all wrought jewels.
\[52]And all the gold of the offering that they offered to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
\[53]([For] the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)
\[54]And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, [for] a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.

ow the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold, the place [was] a place for cattle;
\[2]The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,
\[3]Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
\[4][Even] the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, [is] a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:
\[5]Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given to thy servants for a possession, [and] bring us not over Jordan.
\[6]And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?
\[7]And why discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?
\[8]Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
\[9]For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.
\[10]And the LORD'S anger was kindled the same time, and he swore, saying,
\[11]Surely none of the men that came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:
\[12]Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.
\[13]And the LORD'S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the LORD was consumed.
\[14]And behold, ye have risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD towards Israel.
\[15]For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and he will destroy all this people.
\[16]And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheep-folds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:
\[17]But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities, because of the inhabitants of the land.
\[18]We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.
\[19]For we will not inherit with them on the other side of Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance hath fallen to us on this side of Jordan eastward.
\[20]And Moses said to them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war,
\[21]And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,
\[22]And the land shall be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.
\[23]But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.
\[24]Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.
\[25]And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.
\[26]Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:
\[27]But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord saith.
\[28]So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:
\[29]And Moses said to them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed for battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:
\[30]But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
\[31]And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said to thy servants, so will we do.
\[32]We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan [may be] ours.
\[33]And Moses gave to them, [even] to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with its cities in the borders, [even] the cities of the country around.
\[34]And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
\[35]And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,
\[36]And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fortified cities: and folds for sheep.
\[37]And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,
\[38]And Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names to the cities which they built.
\[39]And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite who [was] in it.
\[40]And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt in it.
\[41]And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its small towns, and called them Havoth-jair.
\[42]And Nobah went and took Kenath, and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name.

\[52]Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite demolish all their high places:
\[53]And ye shall dispossess [the inhabitants] of the land, and dwell in it; for I have given you the land to possess it.
\[54]And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's [inheritance] shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.
\[55]But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them [shall be] prickles in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall harass you in the land in which ye dwell.

\[20]And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.
\[21]Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.
\[22]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli.
\[23]The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.
\[24]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.
\[25]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.
\[26]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan.
\[27]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.
\[28]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.

nd the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan [near] Jericho, saying,
\[2]Command the children of Israel, that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give [also] to the Levites suburbs for the cities around them.
\[3]And they shall have the cities to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.
\[4]And the suburbs of the cities which ye shall give to the Levites, [shall reach] from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits on all sides.
\[5]And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city [shall be] in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
\[6]And among the cities which ye shall give to the Levites [there shall be] six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the man-slayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.
\[7][So] all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites [shall be] forty and eight cities: them [shall ye give] with their suburbs.
\[8]And the cities which ye shall give [shall be] of the possession of the children of Israel: from [them that have] many ye shall give many; but from [them that have] few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities to the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.
\[9]And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
\[10]Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye have passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
\[11]Then ye shall appoint for you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, who killeth any person at unawares.
\[12]And they shall be to you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the man-slayer may not die, until he stands before the congregation in judgment.
\[13]And of these cities which ye shall give, six cities shall ye have for refuge.
\[14]Ye shall give three cities on this side of Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, [which] shall be cities of refuge.
\[15]These six cities shall be a refuge, [both] for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.
\[16]And if he shall smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he shall die, he [is] a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\[17]And if he shall smite him by throwing a stone, by which he may die, and he shall die, he [is] a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\[18]Or [if] he shall smite him with a hand-weapon of wood, with which he may die, and he shall die, he [is] a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\[19]The avenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.
\[20]But if he shall thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying in wait, that he die.
\[21]Or in enmity shall smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote [him] shall surely be put to death; [for] he [is] a murderer: the avenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.
\[22]But if he shall thrust him suddenly without enmity, or shall have cast upon him any thing without laying in wait,
\[23]Or with any stone, by which a man may die, seeing [him] not, and shall cast [it] upon him, that he die, and [was] not his enemy, neither sought his harm:
\[24]Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these judgments:
\[25]And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he had fled: and he shall abide in it to the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
\[26]But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he had fled;
\[27]And the avenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the avenger of blood shall kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:
\[28]Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.
\[29]So these [things] shall be for a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
\[30]Whoever killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person [to cause him] to die.
\[31]Moreover, ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, who [is] guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.
\[32]And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that hath fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
\[33]So ye shall not pollute the land in which ye [are]: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed in it, but by the blood of him that shed it.
\[34]Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, in which I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.

nd the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:
\[2]And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
\[3]And if they shall be married to any of the sons of the [other] tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be put to the inheritance of the tribe into which they are received: so it will be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
\[4]And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be put to the inheritance of the tribe into which they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
\[5]And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.
\[6]This [is] the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.
\[7]So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
\[8]And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.
\[9]Neither shall the inheritance remove from [one] tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.
\[10]Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
\[11]For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons:
\[12][And] they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
\[13]These [are] the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan [near] Jericho.

hese [are] the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on the east side of Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against Suf, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
\[2]([There are] eleven days [journey] from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.)
\[3]And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first [day] of the month, [that] Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the LORD had given him in commandment to them;
\[4]After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:
\[5]On the east side of Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,
\[6]The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:
\[7]Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and to all [the places] nigh to it, in the plain, on the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea-side, to the land of the Canaanites, and to Lebanon, to the great river, the river Euphrates.
\[8]Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.
\[9]And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:
\[10]The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and behold, ye [are] this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
\[11](The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye [are], and bless you, as he hath promised you!)
\[12]How can I alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
\[13]Take ye wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.
\[14]And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken [is] good [for us] to do.
\[15]So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.
\[16]And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes] between your brethren, and judge righteously between [every] man and his brother, and the stranger [that is] with him.
\[17]Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; [but] ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment [is] God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it.
\[18]And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
\[19]And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.
\[20]And I said to you, Ye have come to the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give to us.
\[21]Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up [and] possess [it], as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said to thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.
\[22]And ye came near to me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall explore the land for us, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.
\[23]And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:
\[24]And they turned and ascended the mountain, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and explored it.
\[25]And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought [it] down to us, and brought us word again, and said, [It is] a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.
\[26]Notwithstanding, ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:
\[27]And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth from the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
\[28]Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people [are] greater and taller than we; the cities [are] great and walled up to heaven; and moreover, we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.
\[29]Then I said to you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
\[30]The LORD your God who goeth before you; he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;
\[31]And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how the LORD thy God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.
\[32]Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,
\[33]Who went in the way before you, to search out for you a place to pitch your tents [in], in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.
\[34]And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying,
\[35]Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,
\[36]Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trod upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.
\[37]Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.
\[38][But] Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither. Encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
\[39]Moreover, your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
\[40]But [as for] you, turn ye, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
\[41]Then ye answered and said to me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to ascend the hill.
\[42]And the LORD said to me, Say to them, Go not up, neither fight; for I [am] not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.
\[43]So I spoke to you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and presumptuously ascended the hill.
\[44]And the Amorites, who dwelt on that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, [even] to Hormah.
\[45]And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear to you.
\[46]So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according to the days that ye abode [there].

hen we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spoke to me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.
\[2]And the LORD spoke to me, saying,
\[3]Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
\[4]And command thou the people, saying, Ye [are] to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: therefore take ye good heed to yourselves:
\[5]Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot-breadth; because I have given mount Seir to Esau [for] a possession.
\[6]Ye shall buy food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.
\[7]For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God [hath been] with thee: thou hast lacked nothing.
\[8]And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
\[9]And the LORD said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land [for] a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot [for] a possession.
\[10](The Emims dwelt in it in times past, a people great, and many, and tall as the Anakims;
\[11]Who also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.
\[12]The Horims also dwelt formerly in Seir, but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which the LORD gave to them.)
\[13]Now rise, [said I], and pass over the brook Zered: and we went over the brook Zered.
\[14]And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we passed the brook Zered, [was] thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted from among the host, as the LORD swore to them.
\[15]For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.
\[16]So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
\[17]That the LORD spoke to me, saying,
\[18]Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:
\[19]And [when] thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon [any] possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot [for] a possession.
\[20](That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt in it in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;
\[21]A people great, and many, and tall as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:
\[22]As he did to the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even to this day:
\[23]And the Avims who dwelt in Hazerim [even] to Azzah, the Caphtorims, who came forth from Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)
\[24]Arise ye, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess [it], and contend with him in battle.
\[25]This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations [that are] under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.
\[26]And I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
\[27]Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the highway, I will neither turn to the right hand nor to the left.
\[28]Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;
\[29](As the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.
\[30]But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as [appeareth] this day.
\[31]And the LORD said to me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.
\[32]Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.
\[33]And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.
\[34]And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones of every city, we left none to remain.
\[35]Only the cattle we took for a prey to ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.
\[36]From Aroer, which [is] by the brink of the river of Arnon, and [from] the city that [is] by the river, even to Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all to us:
\[37]Only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, [nor] to any place of the river Jabbok, nor to the cities on the mountains, nor to whatever the LORD our God forbad us.

hen we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
\[2]And the LORD said to me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.
\[3]So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.
\[4]And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\[5]All these cities [were] fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides unwalled towns a great number.
\[6]And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city.
\[7]But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.
\[8]And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that [was] on this side of Jordan, from the river of Arnon to mount Hermon;
\[9]([Which] Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)
\[10]All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\[11]For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead [was] a bedstead of iron; [is] it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits [was] the length of it, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.
\[12]And this land, [which] we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which [is] by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
\[13]And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, [being] the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.
\[14]Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob, to the borders of Geshuri, and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, to this day.
\[15]And I gave Gilead to Machir.
\[16]And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even to the river Jabbok, [which is] the border of the children of Ammon:
\[17]The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast [of it], from Chinnereth even to the sea of the plain, [even] the salt-sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.
\[18]And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it; ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all [that are] meet for the war.
\[19]But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, ([for] I know that ye have many cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;
\[20]Until the LORD shall have given rest to your brethren, as well as to you, and [until] they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and [then] shall ye return every man to his possession which I have given you.
\[21]And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thy eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done to these two kings: so shall the LORD do to all the kingdoms whither thou passest.
\[22]Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.
\[23]And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,
\[24]O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God [is there] in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?
\[25]I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that [is] beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
\[26]But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said to me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more to me of this matter.
\[27]Ascend to the top of Pisgah, and lift up thy eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thy eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
\[28]But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.

\[7]For what nation [is there so] great, which [hath] God [so] nigh to them, as the LORD our God [is] in all [things that] we call upon him [for]?
\[8]And what nation [is there so] great, that hath statutes and judgments [so] righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
\[9]Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou shouldst forget the things which thy eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them to thy sons, and thy sons' sons:
\[10][Specially] the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said to me, Assemble the people to me, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and [that] they may teach their children.
\[11]And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.
\[12]And the LORD spoke to you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only [ye heard] a voice.
\[13]And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, [even] ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.
\[14]And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.
\[15]Take ye therefore good heed to yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day [that] the LORD spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire;
\[16]Lest ye corrupt [yourselves], and make to you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
\[17]The likeness of any beast that [is] on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,
\[18]The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that [is] in the waters beneath the earth:
\[19]And lest thou shouldst lift up thy eyes to heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, [even] all the host of heaven, shouldst be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided to all nations under the whole heaven.
\[20]But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, [even] from Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as [ye are] this day.
\[21]Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not enter that good land which the LORD thy God giveth thee [for] an inheritance:
\[22]But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.
\[23]Take heed to yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, [or] the likeness of any [thing] which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.
\[24]For the LORD thy God [is] a consuming fire, [even] a jealous God.
\[25]When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt [yourselves], and make a graven image, [or] the likeness of any [thing], and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:
\[26]I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from the land to which ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong [your] days upon it, but shall be utterly destroyed.
\[27]And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.
\[28]And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
\[29]But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find [him], if thou shalt seek him with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.
\[30]When thou art in tribulation, and all these things have come upon thee, [even] in the latter days, if thou shalt turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient to his voice;
\[31](For the LORD thy God [is] a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers, which he swore to them.
\[32]For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and [ask] from the one side of heaven to the other, whether there hath been [any such thing] as this great thing [is], or hath been heard like it?
\[33]Did [ever] people hear the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?
\[34]Or hath God essayed to go [and] take him a nation from the midst of [another] nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an out-stretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
\[35]To thee it was shown, that thou mightest know that the LORD he [is] God; [there is] none besides him.
\[36]Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee; and upon earth he showed thee his great fire; and thou heardst his words from the midst of the fire.
\[37]And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out of Egypt in his sight with his mighty power.
\[38]To drive out nations from before thee, greater and mightier than thou [art], to bring thee in, to give thee their land [for] an inheritance, as [it is] this day.
\[39]Know therefore this day, and consider [it] in thy heart, that the LORD he [is] God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: [there is] none else.
\[40]Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes and his commandments which I command thee this day, that it may be well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong [thy] days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.
\[41]Then Moses set apart three cities on the side of Jordan, towards the sun-rising;
\[42]That the slayer might flee thither, who should kill his neighbor unawares, and when he had not hated him in times past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live:
\[43][Namely], Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.
\[44]And this [is] the law which Moses set before the children of Israel.
\[45]These [are] the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, after they came forth from Egypt,
\[46]On the east side of Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they had come forth from Egypt:
\[47]And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, who [were] on the side of Jordan, towards the sun-rising;
\[48]From Aroer, which [is] by the bank of the river Arnon, even to mount Sion, which [is] Hermon,
\[49]And all the plain on the side of Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.

nd Moses called all Israel, and said to them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.
\[2]The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
\[3]The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, [even] us, who [are] all of us here alive this day.
\[4]The LORD talked with you face to face on the mount, from the midst of the fire,
\[5](I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to show you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up upon the mount;) saying,
\[6]I [am] the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
\[7]Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
\[8]Thou shalt not make for thee [any] graven image, [or] any likeness [of any thing] that [is] in heaven above, or that [is] on the earth beneath, or that [is] in the waters beneath the earth:
\[9]Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God [am] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth [generation] of them that hate me,
\[10]And showing mercy to thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
\[11]Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold [him] guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
\[12]Keep the sabbath-day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee.
\[13]Six days thou shalt labor, and do all thy work:
\[14]But the seventh day [is] the sabbath of the LORD thy God: [in it] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy ox, nor thy ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that [is] within thy gates; that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou.
\[15]And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and [that] the LORD thy God brought thee out thence with a mighty hand and by an out-stretched arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath-day.
\[16]Honor thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may be well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
\[17]Thou shalt not kill.
\[18]Neither shalt thou commit adultery.
\[19]Neither shalt thou steal.
\[20]Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor.
\[21]Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbor's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor's house, his field, or his man-servant, or his maid-servant, his ox, or his ass, or any [thing] that [is] thy neighbor's.
\[22]These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly on the mount from the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them to me.
\[23]And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near to me, [even] all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
\[24]And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice from the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.
\[25]Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.
\[26]For who [is there of] all flesh that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we [have], and lived?
\[27]Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say; and speak thou to us all that the LORD our God shall speak to thee; and we will hear [it], and do [it].
\[28]And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke to me; and the LORD said to me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoke to thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.
\[29]O that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!
\[30]Go, say to them, Return to your tents again.
\[31]But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak to thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do [them] in the land which I give them to possess it.
\[32]Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
\[33]Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and [that it may be] well with you, and [that] ye may prolong [your] days in the land which ye shall possess.

\[3]Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do [it]; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.
\[4]Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God [is] one LORD:
\[5]And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
\[6]And these words which I command thee this day, shall be in thy heart:

\[11]And houses full of all good [things], which thou didst not fill, and wells digged, which thou didst not dig, vineyards and olive-trees, which thou didst not plant; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;
\[12][Then] beware lest thou shouldst forget the LORD, who brought thee forth from the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
\[13]Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.
\[14]Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which [are] around you;
\[15](For the LORD thy God [is] a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God should be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.
\[16]Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted [him] in Massah.
\[17]Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.
\[18]And thou shalt do [that which is] right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore to thy fathers,
\[19]To cast out all thy enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken.

\[21]Then thou shalt say to thy son, We were Pharoah's bond-men in Egypt: and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:
\[22]And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and distressing, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:
\[23]And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.
\[24]And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as [it is] at this day.

\[2]And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee, thou shalt smite them [and] utterly destroy them, thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them:
\[3]Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give to his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take to thy son.
\[4]For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.
\[5]But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.
\[6]For thou [art] a holy people to the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people to himself, above all people that [are] upon the face of the earth.
\[7]The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye [were] the fewest of all people:
\[8]But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn to your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you from the house of bond-men, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
\[9]Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he [is] God, the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations:
\[10]And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.
\[11]Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.
\[12]Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God will keep to thee the covenant and the mercy which he swore to thy fathers:
\[13]And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless thy children, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thy oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he swore to thy fathers to give thee.
\[14]Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.
\[15]And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt (which thou knowest) upon thee; but will lay them upon all [them] that hate thee.
\[16]And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver to thee; thy eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that [will be] a snare to thee.
\[17]If thou shalt say in thy heart, These nations [are] more than I, how can I dispossess them?
\[18]Thou shalt not be afraid of them: [but] shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt;
\[19]The great temptations which thy eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the out-stretched arm, by which the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do to all the people of whom thou art afraid.
\[20]Moreover, the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, shall be destroyed.
\[21]Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God [is] among you, a mighty God and terrible.
\[22]And the LORD thy God will drive out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.
\[23]But the LORD thy God shall deliver them to thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they are destroyed.
\[24]And he shall deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou shalt have destroyed them.
\[25]The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold [that is] on them, nor take [it] to thee, lest thou shouldst be snared in it: for it [is] an abomination to the LORD thy God.
\[26]Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thy house, lest thou shouldst be a cursed thing like it: [but] thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it [is] a cursed thing.

ll the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers.
\[2]And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, [and] to prove thee, to know what [was] in thy heart, whether thou wouldst keep his commandments, or not.
\[3]And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every [word] that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.
\[4]Thy raiment hath not become old upon thee, neither hath thy foot swelled these forty years.
\[5]Thou shalt also consider in thy heart, that as a man chasteneth his son, [so] the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.
\[6]Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
\[7]For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains, and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;
\[8]A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig-trees, and pomegranates, a land of olive-oil, and honey;
\[9]A land in which thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any [thing] in it, a land whose stones [are] iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.
\[10]When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.
\[11]Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:
\[12]Lest [when] thou hast eaten, and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt [in them];
\[13]And [when] thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold are increased, and all that thou hast is increased;
\[14]Then thy heart shall be lifted up, and thou shalt forget the LORD thy God (who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;)
\[15]Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, [in which were] fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drouth, where [there was] no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;
\[16]Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end.
\[17]And thou shalt say in thy heart, My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth.
\[18]But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for [it is] he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to thy fathers, as [it is] this day.
\[19]And it shall be, if thou shalt at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.

\[2]A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and [of whom] thou hast heard [it said], Who can stand before the children of Anak!
\[3]Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God [is] he who goeth over before thee; [as] a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said to thee.
\[4]Speak not thou in thy heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.
\[5]Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations, the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD swore to thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
\[6]Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou [art] a stiff-necked people.
\[7]Remember, [and] forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart from the land of Egypt, until ye came to this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.
\[8]Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.
\[9]When I ascended the mount, to receive the tables of stone, [even] the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither ate bread, nor drank water:
\[10]And the LORD delivered to me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them [was written] according to all the words which the LORD spoke with you in the mount, from the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly.
\[11]And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, [that] the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, [even] the tables of the covenant.
\[12]And the LORD said to me, Arise, go down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted [themselves]; they are quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.
\[13]Furthermore, the LORD spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people, and behold, it [is] a stiff-necked people:
\[14]Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.
\[15]So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant [were] in my two hands.
\[16]And I looked, and behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, [and] had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly from the way which the LORD had commanded you.
\[17]And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.
\[18]And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I neither ate bread, nor drank water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
\[19](For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you.) But the LORD hearkened to me at that time also.
\[20]And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
\[21]And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, [and] ground [it] very small, [even] until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust of it into the brook that descended from the mount.
\[22]And at Taberah, and at Massah, and Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.
\[23]Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.
\[24]Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.
\[25]Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down [at the first]; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.
\[26]I prayed therefore to the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thy inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
\[27]Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:
\[28]Lest the land from which thou hast brought us should say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
\[29]Yet they [are] thy people and thy inheritance which thou hast brought out by thy mighty power and by thy out-stretched arm.

\[3]And I made an ark [of] shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like the first, and ascended the mount, having the two tables in my hand.
\[4]And he wrote on the tables according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spoke to you in the mount, from the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them to me.

\[7]From thence they journeyed to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.
\[8]At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.
\[9]Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD [is] his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.
\[10]And I stayed in the mount, according to the first-time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened to me at that time also, [and] the LORD would not destroy thee.
\[11]And the LORD said to me, Arise, take [thy] journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them.
\[12]And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,
\[13]To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?
\[14]Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens belongeth to the LORD thy God, the earth [also], with all that it contains.
\[15]Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, [even] you above all people, as [it is] this day.
\[16]Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.
\[17]For the LORD your God [is] God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:
\[18]He executeth the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.
\[19]Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
\[20]Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.
\[21]He [is] thy praise, and he [is] thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things which thy eyes have seen.

\[7]But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.
\[8]Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;
\[9]And that ye may prolong [your] days in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them, and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
\[10]For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, [is] not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou didst sow thy seed, and water [it] with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:
\[11]But the land, whither ye go to possess it, [is] a land of hills and valleys, [and] drinketh water of the rain of heaven:
\[12]A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God [are] always upon it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.
\[13]And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
\[14]That I will give [you] the rain of your land in its due season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine and thy oil.
\[15]And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.
\[16]Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
\[17]And [then] the LORD'S wrath shall be kindled against you, and he shall shut up the heaven, that there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield her fruit; and [lest] ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.
\[18]Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.
\[19]And ye shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
\[20]And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thy house, and upon thy gates:
\[21]That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.
\[22]For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave to him;
\[23]Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.
\[24]Every place on which the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the uttermost sea shall your limit be.
\[25]There shall no man be able to stand before you: [for] the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you, and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said to you.
\[26]Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:
\[27]A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you this day;
\[28]And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside from the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods which ye have not known.
\[29]And it shall come to pass when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in to the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.
\[30][Are] they not on the other side of Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down in the land of the Canaanites, who dwell in the plain over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?
\[31]For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell in it.
\[32]And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.

hese [are] the statutes and judgments which ye shall observe to do in the land which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.
\[2]Ye shall utterly destroy all the places in which the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:
\[3]And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.
\[4]Ye shall not do so to the LORD your God.
\[5]But the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, [even] his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:
\[6]And thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave-offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your free-will-offerings, and the firstlings of your herds, and of your flocks:
\[7]And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand to, ye and your households, in which the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.
\[8]Ye shall not do after all [the things] that we do here this day, every man whatever [is] right in his own eyes.
\[9]For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the LORD your God giveth you.
\[10]But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and [when] he giveth you rest from all your enemies on every side, so that ye dwell in safety:
\[11]Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow to the LORD:
\[12]And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and the Levite that [is] within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.
\[13]Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest:
\[14]But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.
\[15]Notwithstanding, thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatever thy soul desireth, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat of it as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.
\[16]Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water.
\[17]Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy free-will-offerings, or heave-offering of thy hand:
\[18]But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that [is] within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands to.
\[19]Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth.
\[20]When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatever thy soul desireth.
\[21]If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there, shall be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatever thy soul desireth.
\[22]Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat [of] them alike.
\[23]Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood [is] the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.
\[24]Thou shalt not eat it: thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.
\[25]Thou shalt not eat it; that it may be well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do [that which is] right in the sight of the LORD.
\[26]Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go to the place which the LORD shall choose:
\[27]And thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.
\[28]Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may be well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest [that which is] good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God.
\[29]When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land;
\[30]Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they are destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.
\[31]Thou shalt not do so to the LORD thy God; for every abomination to the LORD which he hateth have they done to their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.
\[32]Whatever thing I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add to it, nor diminish from it.

\[16]According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I may not die.
\[17]And the LORD said to me, They have well [spoken of that] which they have spoken.
\[18]I will raise up to them a prophet from among their brethren, like thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.
\[19]And it shall come to pass, [that] whoever will not hearken to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require [it] of him.

\[2]Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.
\[3]Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the limits of thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.
\[4]And this [is] the case of the slayer, who shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoever killeth his neighbor ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;
\[5]As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand maketh a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and falleth upon his neighbor, that he dieth: he shall flee to one of these cities, and live:
\[6]Lest the avenger of blood shall pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he [was] not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.
\[7]Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.
\[8]And if the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy limits, as he hath sworn to thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give to thy fathers;
\[9]If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, besides these three:
\[10]That innocent blood may not be shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee [for] an inheritance, and [so] blood be upon thee.
\[11]But if any man shall hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally, that he dieth, and he shall flee into one of these cities:
\[12]Then the elders of his city shall send and bring him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.
\[13]Thy eye shall not pity him, but thou shall remove [the guilt of] innocent blood from Israel, that it may be well with thee.
\[14]Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set in thy inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.
\[15]One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth; at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.
\[16]If a false witness shall rise up against any man to testify against him [that which is] wrong;
\[17]Then both the men between whom the controversy [is] shall stand before the LORD, before the priests, and the judges, who shall be in those days;
\[18]And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and behold, [if] the witness [is] a false witness, [and] hath testified falsely against his brother;
\[19]Then shall ye do to him, as he had thought to do to his brother: so shalt thou remove the evil from among you.
\[20]And those who remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.

\[12]When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thy increase the third year, [which is] the year of tithing, and hast given [it] to the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled:
\[13]Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of [my] house, and also have given them to the Levite, and to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten [them]:
\[14]I have not eaten of it in my mourning, neither have I taken away [aught] of it for [any] unclean [use], nor given [aught] of it for the dead: [but] I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, [and] have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.
\[15]Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou didst swear to our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
\[16]This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to perform these statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.
\[17]Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken to his voice:
\[18]And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that [thou] shouldst keep all his commandments;
\[19]And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that thou mayest be a holy people to the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.

\[3]And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou hast passed over, that thou mayest enter in to the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee.
\[4]Therefore it shall be when ye have gone over Jordan, [that] ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaster them with plaster.
\[5]And there shalt thou build an altar to the LORD thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up [any] iron [tool] upon them.
\[6]Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones: and thou shalt offer on it burnt-offerings to the LORD thy God.
\[7]And thou shalt offer peace-offerings, and shalt eat there, and rejoice before the LORD thy God.
\[8]And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law, very plainly.
\[9]And Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying, Take heed and hearken, O Israel, this day thou art become the people of the LORD thy God.
\[10]Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and do his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day.
\[11]And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,
\[12]These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye have come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:
\[13]And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
\[14]And the Levites shall speak, and say to all the men of Israel with a loud voice,
\[15]Cursed [be] the man that maketh [any] graven or molten image, an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the artificer, and putteth [it] in [a] secret [place]: and all the people shall answer, and say Amen.
\[16]Cursed [be] he that setteth light by his father or his mother: and all the people shall say, Amen.

\[22]Cursed [be] he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother: and all the people shall say, Amen.

\[38]Thou shalt carry much seed into the field, and shalt gather [but] little: for the locust shall consume it.
\[39]Thou shalt plant vineyards and dress [them], but shalt neither drink [of] the wine, nor gather [the grapes]: for the worm shall eat them.
\[40]Thou shalt have olive-trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint [thyself] with the oil: for thy olive shall cast [its fruit].

\[48]Therefore shalt thou serve thy enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all [things]: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he hath destroyed thee.

\[52]And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fortified walls come down, in which thou didst trust, throughout all thy land; and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land which the LORD thy God hath given thee.
\[53]And thou shalt eat the fruit of thy own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in the siege and in the straitness with which thy enemies shall distress thee:
\[54][So that] the man [that is] tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil towards his brother, and towards the wife of his bosom, and towards the remnant of his children whom he shall leave:
\[55]So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege and in the straitness with which thy enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.
\[56]The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil towards the husband of her bosom, and towards her son, and towards her daughter,
\[57]And towards her young one, her own offspring, and towards her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all [things] secretly in the siege and straitness with which thy enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.
\[58]If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;
\[59]Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, [even] great plagues, and of long continuance, and severe sicknesses, and of long continuance.
\[60]Moreover, he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, of which thou wast afraid; and they shall cleave to thee.
\[61]Also every sickness, and every plague which [is] not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou art destroyed.
\[62]And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldst not obey the voice of the LORD thy God.
\[63]And it shall come to pass, [that] as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to naught; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.
\[64]And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people from the one end of the earth even to the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, [even] wood and stone.
\[65]And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:
\[66]And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have no assurance of thy life:
\[67]In the morning thou shalt say, O that it were evening, and at evening thou shalt say, O that it were morning! for the fear of thy heart with which thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thy eyes which thou shalt see.
\[68]And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way of which I have said to thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold to your enemies for bond-men and bond-women, and no man shall buy [you].

hese [are] the words of the covenant which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.
\[2]And Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, Ye have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;
\[3]The great temptations which thy eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles:
\[4]Yet the LORD hath not given you a heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.
\[5]And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes have not become old upon you, and thy shoe hath not become old upon thy foot.
\[6]Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drank wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I [am] the LORD your God.
\[7]And when ye came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us to battle, and we smote them:
\[8]And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh.
\[9]Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.
\[10]Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, [with] all the men of Israel,
\[11]Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that [is] in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood to the drawer of thy water:
\[12]That thou shouldst enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day:
\[13]That he may establish thee to-day for a people to himself, and [that] he may be to thee a God, as he hath said to thee, and as he hath sworn to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
\[14]Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;
\[15]But with [him] that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with [him] that [is] not here with us this day:
\[16](For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by;
\[17]And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which [were] among them:)
\[18]Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go [and] serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;
\[19]And it should come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he should bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:
\[20]The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.
\[21]And the LORD shall separate him to evil out of all the tribes of Israel according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law:
\[22]So that the generation to come of your children that shall arise after you, and the stranger that shall come from a distant land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it;
\[23][And that] the whole land of it is brimstone, and salt, [and] burning, [that] it is not sown, nor doth it bear, nor doth any grass grow in it, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger and in his wrath:
\[24]Even all the nations shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus to this land? what [meaneth] the heat of this great anger?
\[25]Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth from the land of Egypt:
\[26]For they went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods which they knew not, and which he had not given to them:
\[27]And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:
\[28]And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as [it is] this day.
\[29]The secret [things belong] to the LORD our God: but those [things which are] revealed [belong] to us, and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.

\[13]Neither [is] it beyond the sea, that thou shouldst say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it?

\[15]See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;
\[16]In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
\[17]But if thy heart shall turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
\[18]I denounce to you this day, that ye shall surely perish, [and that] ye shall not prolong [your] days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.
\[19]I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, [that] I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:
\[20]That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, [and] that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave to him (for he [is] thy life, and the length of thy days) that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD swore to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

\[3]The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, [and] he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: [and] Joshua he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.
\[4]And the LORD shall do to them as he did to Sihon, and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and to the land of them, whom he destroyed.
\[5]And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do to them according to all the commandments which I have commanded you.
\[6]Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he [it is] that doth go with thee, he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
\[7]And Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people to the land which the LORD hath sworn to their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.
\[8]And the LORD, he [it is] that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.
\[9]And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.
\[10]And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of [every] seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,
\[11]When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
\[12]Convene the people, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that [is] within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:
\[13]And [that] their children who have not known [any thing], may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
\[14]And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[15]And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud; and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.
\[16]And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, and this people will rise up, and commit idolatry with the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go [to be] among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
\[17]Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them, so that they will say in that day, Have not these evils come upon us, because our God [is] not among us?
\[18]And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned to other gods.
\[19]Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it to the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
\[20]For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxed fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.
\[21]And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles have befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness: for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they form, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.
\[22]Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel.
\[23]And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with thee.
\[24]And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
\[25]That Moses commanded the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,
\[26]Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.
\[27]For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?
\[28]Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.
\[29]For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt [yourselves], and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.

\[2]My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distill as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:
\[3]Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness to our God.
\[4][He is] the Rock, his work [is] perfect: for all his ways [are] judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity: just and right [is] he.
\[5]They have corrupted themselves, their spot [is] not [the spot] of his children: [they are] a perverse and crooked generation.
\[6]Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? [is] not he thy father [that] hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?
\[7]Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will show thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.
\[8]When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.
\[9]For the LORD'S portion [is] his people; Jacob [is] the lot of his inheritance.
\[10]He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.
\[11]As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings;
\[12][So] the LORD alone did lead him, and [there was] no strange God with him.
\[13]He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;
\[14]Butter of cows, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.
\[15]But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou hast waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered [with fatness]; then he forsook God [who] made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
\[16]They provoked him to jealousy with strange [gods], with abominations they provoked him to anger.
\[17]They sacrificed to devils, not to God; to gods which they knew not, to new [gods that] came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.
\[18]Of the Rock [that] begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.
\[19]And when the LORD saw [it], he abhorred [them], because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.
\[20]And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end [will be]: for they [are] a very froward generation, children in whom [is] no faith.
\[21]They have moved me to jealousy with [that which is] not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with [those who are] not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
\[22]For a fire is kindled in my anger, and shall burn to the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
\[23]I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend my arrows upon them.
\[24][They shall be] burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.
\[25]The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling [also] with the man of gray hairs.
\[26]I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men;
\[27]Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, [and] lest they should say, Our hand [is] high, and the LORD hath not done all this.
\[28]For they [are] a nation void of counsel, neither [is there any] understanding in them.
\[29]O that they were wise, [that] they understood this, [that] they would consider their latter end!
\[30]How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?
\[31]For their rock [is] not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves [being] judges:
\[32]For their vine [is] of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes [are] grapes of gall, their clusters [are] bitter:
\[33]Their wine [is] the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.
\[34][Is] not this laid up in store with me, [and] sealed up among my treasures?
\[35]To me [belongeth] vengeance, and recompense; their foot shall slide in [due] time: for the day of their calamity [is] at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.
\[36]For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent for his servants: when he seeth that [their] power is gone, and [there is] none shut up, or left.
\[37]And he shall say, Where [are] their gods, [their] rock in whom they trusted,
\[38]Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, [and] drank the wine of their drink-offerings? let them rise up and help you, [and] be your protection.
\[39]See now that I, [even] I [am] he, and [there is] no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither [is there any] that can deliver out of my hand.
\[40]For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.
\[41]If I shall whet my glittering sword, and my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my enemies, and will reward them that hate me.
\[42]I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; [and that] with the blood of the slain and of the captives from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.
\[43]Rejoice, O ye nations, [with] his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, [and] to his people.
\[44]And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Hoshea the son of Nun.
\[45]And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;
\[46]And he said to them, Set your hearts to all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.
\[47]For it [is] not a vain thing for you: because it [is] your life; and through this thing ye shall prolong [your] days in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
\[48]And the LORD spoke to Moses that same day, saying,
\[49]Ascend this mountain Abarim, [to] mount Nebo, which [is] in the land of Moab, that [is] over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan which I give to the children of Israel for a Possession:
\[50]And die in the mount whither thou goest, and be gathered to thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his people:
\[51]Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.
\[52]Yet thou shalt see the land before [thee], but thou shalt not go thither to the land which I give the children of Israel.

\[2]And he said, the LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand [went] a fiery law for them.
\[3]Yea, he loved the people; all his saints [are] in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; [every one] shall receive of thy words.
\[4]Moses commanded us a law; [even] the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.
\[5]And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people [and] the tribes of Israel were assembled.
\[6]Let Reuben live, and not die; and let [not] his men be few.
\[7]And this [is the blessing] of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him to his people: let his hands be sufficient for him, and be thou a help [to him] from his enemies.
\[8]And of Levi he said, [Let] thy Thummim and thy Urim [be] with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, [and with] whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;
\[9]Who said to his father and to his mother, I have not seen him, neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor know his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.
\[10]They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law; they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thy altar.
\[11]Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.
\[12][And] of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; [and the LORD] shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.
\[13]And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD [be] his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,
\[14]And for the precious fruits [brought forth] by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,
\[15]And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,
\[16]And for the precious things of the earth and fullness of it, and [for] the good will of him that dwelt in the bush; let [the blessing] come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.
\[17]His glory [is like] the firstling of his bullock, and his horns [are like] the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they [are] the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they [are] the thousands of Manasseh.
\[18]And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and Issachar, in thy tents.
\[19]They shall call the people to the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck [of] the abundance of the seas, and [of] treasures hid in the sand.
\[20]And of Gad he said: Blessed [be] he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.
\[21]And he provided the first part for himself, because there, [in] a portion of the lawgiver, [was he] seated: and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.
\[22]And of Dan he said, Dan [is] a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.
\[23]And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south.
\[24]And of Asher he said, [Let] Asher [be] blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.
\[25]Thy shoes [shall be] iron and brass; and as thy days, [so shall] thy strength [be].
\[26][There is] none like to the God of Jeshurun, [who] rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellence on the sky.
\[27]The eternal God [is thy] refuge, and underneath [are] the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee, and shall say, Destroy [them].
\[28]Israel then shall dwell in safety alone; the fountain of Jacob [shall be] upon a land of corn and wine, also his heavens shall drop down dew.
\[29]Happy [art] thou, O Israel: who [is] like to thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who [is] the sword of thy excellence! and thy enemies shall be found liars to thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.

\[2]And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the utmost sea,
\[3]And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm-trees, to Zoar.

\[8]And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping [and] mourning for Moses were ended.
\[9]And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened to him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[10]And there arose not a prophet afterwards in Israel like to Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,

\[2]Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, to the land which I do give to them, [even] to the children of Israel.
\[3]Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given to you, as I said to Moses.
\[4]From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea towards the setting of the sun, shall be your border.
\[5]There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, [so] I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
\[6]Be strong and of a good courage: for to this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.
\[7]Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it [to] the right hand or [to] the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.
\[8]This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate in it day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all [that is] written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
\[9]Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God [is] with thee whithersoever thou goest.
\[10]Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
\[11]Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you provisions; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.
\[12]And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spoke Joshua, saying,
\[13]Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.
\[14]Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them;
\[15]Until the LORD shall have given your brethren rest, as [he hath given] you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return to the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side of Jordan towards the sun-rising.
\[16]And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us, we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.
\[17]According as we hearkened to Moses in all things, so will we hearken to thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.
\[18]Every one that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken to thy words in all that thou commandest him, shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.

\[2]And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel, to search out the country.
\[3]And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that have come to thee, who have entered into thy house: for they have come to search out all the country.
\[4]And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men to me, but I knew not whence they [were]:
\[5]And it came to pass [about the time] of shutting the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went, I know not: pursue after them quickly; for ye will overtake them.
\[6]But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.
\[7]And the men pursued them the way to Jordan to the fords: and as soon as they who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.
\[8]And before they had lain down, she came up to them upon the roof;
\[9]And she said to the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror hath fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.
\[10]For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did to the two kings of the Amorites, that [were] on the other side of Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
\[11]And as soon as we had heard [these things], our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he [is] God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.
\[12]Now therefore, I pray you, swear to me by the LORD, since I have showed you kindness, that ye will also show kindness to my father's house, and give me a true token:
\[13]And [that] ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.
\[14]And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.
\[15]Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house [was] upon the town-wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
\[16]And she said to them, Depart to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned: and afterward ye may go your way.
\[17]And the men said to her, We [will be] blameless of this thy oath which thou hast made us swear.
\[18]Behold, [when] we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window by which thou didst let us down: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household home to thee.
\[19]And it shall be, [that] whoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood [shall be] upon his head, and we [will be] guiltless: and whoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood [shall be] on our head, if [any] hand be upon him.
\[20]And if thou shalt utter this our business, then we will be quit of thy oath which thou hast made us to swear.
\[21]And she said, According to your words, so [be] it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
\[22]And they went, and came to the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers had returned: and the pursuers sought [them] throughout all the way, but found [them] not.
\[23]So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all [things] that befell them:

\[3]And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.
\[4]Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near to it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed [this] way heretofore.

\[6]And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
\[7]And the LORD said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, [so] I will be with thee.
\[8]And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye have come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.
\[9]And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.
\[10]And Joshua said, By this ye shall know that the living God [is] among you, and [that] he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.
\[11]Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.
\[12]Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.
\[13]And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, [that] the waters of Jordan shall be cut off [from] the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in a heap.

\[4]Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, of every tribe a man:

\[11]And it came to pass, when all the people had quite passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests in the presence of the people.
\[12]And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses directed them:
\[13]About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD to battle, to the plains of Jericho.

\[19]And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth [day] of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.
\[20]And those twelve stones which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal.
\[21]And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What [mean] these stones?
\[22]Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
\[23]For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye had passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had gone over:

\[2]At that time the LORD said to Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.
\[3]And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
\[4]And this [is] the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, [that were] males, [even] all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
\[5]Now all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people [that were] born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth from Egypt, [them] they had not circumcised.
\[6]For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people [that were] men of war who came out of Egypt were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: to whom the LORD swore that he would not show them the land which the LORD swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
\[7]And their children, [whom] he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.
\[8]And it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
\[9]And the LORD said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you: Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.
\[10]And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.
\[11]And they ate of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched [corn] in the same day.
\[12]And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
\[13]And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, [Art] thou for us, or for our adversaries?
\[14]And he said, No; but [as] captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and said to him, What saith my lord to his servant?
\[15]And the captain of the LORD'S host said to Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place on which thou standest is holy: and Joshua did so.

ow Jericho was closely shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.
\[2]And the LORD said to Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and its king, [and] the mighty men of valor.
\[3]And ye shall compass the city, all [ye] men of war, [and] go round the city once: thus shalt thou do six days.
\[4]And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.
\[5]And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long [blast] with the ram's horn, [and] when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout: and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend every man straight before him.
\[6]And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.
\[7]And he said to the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.
\[8]And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.
\[9]And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rear-guard came after the ark, [the priests] going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
\[10]And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall [any] word proceed from your mouth, until the day I bid you shout, then shall ye shout.
\[11]So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about [it] once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.
\[12]And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.
\[13]And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rear-guard came after the ark of the LORD, [the priests] going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
\[14]And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.
\[15]And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.
\[16]And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.
\[17]And the city shall be accursed, [even] it, and all that [are] in it, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that [are] with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
\[18]And ye, in any wise keep [yourselves] from the accursed thing, lest ye make [yourselves] accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.
\[19]But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, [are] consecrated to the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.
\[20]So the people shouted when [the priests] blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.
\[21]And they utterly destroyed all that [was] in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.
\[22]But Joshua had said to the two men that spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye swore to her.
\[23]And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.
\[24]And they burnt the city with fire, and all that [was] in it: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.
\[25]And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel [even] to this day; because she hid the messengers which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
\[26]And Joshua adjured [them] at that time, saying, Cursed [be] the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay its foundation in his first-born, and in his youngest [son] shall he set up the gates of it.
\[27]So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was [noised] throughout all the country.

ut the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.
\[2]And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which [is] beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.
\[3]And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; [and] make not all the people to labor thither; for they [are but] few.
\[4]So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.
\[5]And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them [from] before the gate [even] to Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.
\[6]And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.
\[7]And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, why hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? O that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of Jordan.
\[8]O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turn their backs before their enemies!
\[9]For the Canaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land will hear [of it], and will environ us, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do to thy great name?
\[10]And the LORD said to Joshua, Arise; Why liest thou thus upon thy face?
\[11]Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put [it] even among their own goods.
\[12]Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, [but] turned [their] backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.
\[13]Rise, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, [There is] an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thy enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.
\[14]In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, [that] the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to their families: and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.
\[15]And it shall be, [that] he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.
\[16]So Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:
\[17]And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:
\[18]And he brought his household man by man; and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
\[19]And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what thou hast done, hide [it] not from me.
\[20]And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done.
\[21]When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them, and behold, they [are] hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
\[22]So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and behold, [it was] hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
\[23]And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.
\[24]And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them to the valley of Achor.
\[25]And Joshua said, why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.
\[26]And they raised over him a great heap of stones to this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger: wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of Achor to this day.

nd the LORD said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:
\[2]And thou shalt do to Ai and her king, as thou didst to Jericho and her king: only its spoil, and its cattle, shall ye take for a prey to yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.
\[3]So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night.
\[4]And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, [even] behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:
\[5]And I, and all the people that [are] with me, will approach to the city: and it shall come to pass when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,
\[6](For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.
\[7]Then ye shall rise from the ambush and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand,
\[8]And it shall be when ye have taken the city, [that] ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.
\[9]Joshua therefore sent them forth; and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
\[10]And Joshua rose early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
\[11]And all the people, [even the people] of war that [were] with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now [there was] a valley between them and Ai.
\[12]And he took about five thousand men; and set them to lie in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.
\[13]And when they had set the people, [even] all the host that [was] on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
\[14]And it came to pass when the king of Ai saw [it], that they hasted and rose early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain: but he knew not that [there were] liers in ambush against him behind the city.
\[15]And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
\[16]And all the people that [were] in Ai were called together to pursue them: and they pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
\[17]And there was not a man left in Ai, or Beth-el that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued Israel.
\[18]And the LORD said to Joshua, Stretch out the spear that [is] in thy hand towards Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that [he had] in his hand towards the city.
\[19]And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted, and set the city on fire.
\[20]And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
\[21]And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again and slew the men of Ai.
\[22]And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
\[23]And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
\[24]And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they chased them, and when they had all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
\[25]And [so] it was, [that] all that fell that day, both of men and women, [were] twelve thousand, [even] all the men of Ai.
\[26]For Joshua drew not his hand back with which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
\[27]Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey to themselves, according to the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.
\[28]And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, [even] a desolation to this day.
\[29]And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcass down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise upon it a great heap of stones, [that remaineth] to this day.
\[30]Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,
\[31]As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lifted up [any] iron: and they offered upon it burnt-offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed peace-offerings.
\[32]And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.
\[33]And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark, and on that side, before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.
\[34]And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
\[35]There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.

\[2]That they assembled themselves, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
\[3]And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
\[4]They did work craftily, and went and made as if they had been embassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine-bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;
\[5]And old shoes and patched upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry [and] moldy.
\[6]And they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, We have come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.
\[7]And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, It may be ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?
\[8]And they said to Joshua, we [are] thy servants. And Joshua said to them, Who [are] ye? and whence come ye?
\[9]And they said to him, From a very far country thy servants have come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
\[10]And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that [were] beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who [was] at Ashtaroth.
\[11]Wherefore our elders, and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, We [are] your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us:
\[12]This our bread we took hot [for] our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is moldy:
\[13]And these bottles of wine which we filled, [were] new, and behold, they are rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.
\[14]And the men took of their provisions, and asked not [counsel] at the mouth of the LORD.
\[15]And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation swore to them.
\[16]And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they [were] their neighbors, and [that] they dwelt among them.
\[17]And the children of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities [were] Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.
\[18]And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.
\[19]But all the princes said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.
\[20]This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we swore to them.
\[21]And the princes said to them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood, and drawers of water to all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.
\[22]And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have ye deceived us, saying, We [are] very far from you; when ye dwell among us?
\[23]Now therefore ye [are] cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bond-men, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.
\[24]And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were greatly afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
\[25]And now, behold, we [are] in thy hand: do as it seemeth good and right to thee to do to us,
\[26]And so did he to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.
\[27]And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even to this day, in the place which he should choose.

ow it came to pass, when Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;
\[2]That they feared greatly, because Gibeon [was] a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it [was] greater than Ai, and all the men of it [were] mighty.
\[3]Wherefore Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
\[4]Come up to me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
\[5]Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, assembled themselves, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.
\[6]And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains, are assembled against us.
\[7]So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
\[8]And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.
\[9]Joshua therefore came to them suddenly, [and] went up from Gilgal all night.
\[10]And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and to Makkedah.
\[11]And it came to pass as they fled from before Israel, [and] were in the descent to Beth-horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them to Azekah, and they died: [they were] more who died with hailstones than [they] whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.
\[12]Then spoke Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.
\[13]And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. [Is] not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.
\[14]And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened to the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.
\[15]And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
\[16]But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
\[17]And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.
\[18]And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them:
\[19]And stay you not, [but] pursue your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.
\[20]And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest [who] remained of them entered into fortified cities.
\[21]And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
\[22]Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings to me out of the cave.
\[23]And they did so, and brought those five kings to him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, [and] the king of Eglon.
\[24]And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.
\[25]And Joshua said to them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.
\[26]And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
\[27]And it came to pass at the time of the setting of the sun, [that] Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had been hid, and laid great stones upon the cave's mouth, [which remain] until this very day.
\[28]And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king of it he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that [were] in it; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho.
\[29]Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah:
\[30]And the LORD delivered it also, and its king, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that [were] in it; he let none remain in it; but did to the king of it as he did to the king of Jericho.
\[31]And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:
\[32]And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, who took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that [were] in it, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
\[33]Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
\[34]And from Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:
\[35]And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that [were] in it he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
\[36]And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it:
\[37]And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king, and all its cities, and all the souls that [were] in them; he left none remaining (according to all that he had done to Eglon) but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that [were] in it.
\[38]And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:
\[39]And he took it, and its king, and all its cities, and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that [were] in them; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king.
\[40]So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.
\[41]And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.
\[42]And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time; because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.

\[8]And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them to great Zidon, and to Misrephoth-maim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left to them none remaining.
\[9]And Joshua did to them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.
\[10]And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote its king with the sword: for Hazor before-time was the head of all those kingdoms.
\[11]And they smote all the souls that [were] in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying [them]: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.
\[12]And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, Joshua took, and smote them with the edge of the sword, [and] he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.
\[13]But [as for] the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; [that] did Joshua burn.
\[14]And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey to themselves: but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.
\[15]As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua: he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.
\[16]So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;
\[17][Even] from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even to Baal-gad, in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.
\[18]Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
\[19]There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all [other] they took in battle.
\[20]For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, [and] that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[21]And at that time came Joshua and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.
\[22]There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.
\[23]So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said to Moses, and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.

\[2]This [is] the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,
\[3]From Sihor, which [is] before Egypt, even to the borders of Ekron northward, [which] is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:
\[4]From the south all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that [is] beside the Sidonians, to Aphek to the borders of the Amorites:
\[5]And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon towards the sun-rising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon to the entering into Hamath.
\[6]And the inhabitants of the hill-country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, [and] all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot to the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
\[7]Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
\[8]With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, [even] as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.
\[9]From Aroer that [is] upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that [is] in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon;
\[10]And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;

\[12]All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants. For these did Moses smite, and cast them out.
\[13]Nevertheless, the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.
\[14]Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire [are] their inheritance, as he said to them.
\[15]And Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben [inheritance] according to their families.
\[16]And their border was from Aroer that [is] on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that [is] in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba;
\[17]Heshbon, and all her cities that [are] in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon,
\[18]And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
\[19]And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zareth-shahar in the mount of the valley,
\[20]And Beth-peor, and Ashdoth-pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth,
\[21]And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.
\[22]Balaam also the son of Beor, the sooth-sayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword, among them that were slain by them.
\[23]And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and its border. This [was] the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and their villages.
\[24]And Moses gave [inheritance] to the tribe of Gad, [even] to the children of Gad according to their families.
\[25]And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that [is] before Rabbah;
\[26]And from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;

\[28]This [is] the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages.
\[29]And Moses gave [inheritance] to the half-tribe of Manasseh: and [this] was [the possession] of the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.
\[30]And their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which [are] in Bashan, sixty cities:
\[31]And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, [were pertaining] to the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, [even] to the one half of the children of Machir by their families.
\[32]These [are the countries] which Moses distributed for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side of Jordan by Jericho eastward.

nd these [are the countries] which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel distributed for inheritance to them.
\[2]By lot [was] their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and [for] the half-tribe.
\[3]For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and a half-tribe on the other side of Jordan: but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.
\[4]For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part to the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell [in], with their suburbs for their cattle, and for their substance.
\[5]As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.
\[6]Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh-barnea.
\[7]Forty years old [was] I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to explore the land; and I brought him word again as it [was] in my heart.
\[8]Nevertheless, my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.
\[9]And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land on which thy feet have trodden shall be thy inheritance, and thy children's for ever; because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.
\[10]And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while [the children of] Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I [am] this day eighty five years old.
\[11]As yet I [am as] strong this day, as [I was] in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength [was] then, even so [is] my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.
\[12]Now therefore give me this mountain, of which the LORD spoke in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims [were] there, and [that] the cities [were] great [and] fortified: if the LORD [will be] with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.
\[13]And Joshua blessed him, and gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.
\[14]Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite to this day; because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.
\[15]And the name of Hebron before [was] Kirjath-arba; [which Arba was] a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.

\[13]And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, [even] the city of Arba the father of Anak, which [city is] Hebron.
\[14]And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
\[15]And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before [was] Kirjath-sepher.
\[16]And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter for a wife.
\[17]And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.
\[18]And it came to pass, as she came [to him], that she moved him to ask of her father a field. And she lighted off [her] ass; and Caleb said to her, What wouldst thou?
\[19]Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land, give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.

\[2]There was also [a lot] for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these [were] the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.

\[4]And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren: therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.
\[5]And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which [were] on the other side of Jordan;
\[6]Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.
\[7]And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that [lieth] before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.

\[10]Southward [it was] Ephraim's, and northward [it was] Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.
\[11]And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Tanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, [even] three countries.
\[12]Yet the children of Manasseh could not expel [the inhabitants of] those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
\[13]Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel had become strong, that they subjected the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly expel them.
\[14]And the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me [but] one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I [am] a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath hitherto blessed me?
\[15]And Joshua answered them, If thou [art] a great people, [then] go up to the wood, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim is too narrow for thee.
\[16]And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, [both they] who [are] of Beth-shean and its towns, and [they] who [are] of the valley of Jezreel.
\[17]And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, [even] to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou [art] a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot [only]:
\[18]But the mountain shall be thine; for it [is] a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the limits of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, [and] though they [are] strong.

\[4]Select from among you three men for [each] tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them, and they shall come [again] to me.

\[7]But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD [is] their inheritance. And Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.

\[16]And the border came down to the end of the mountain that [lieth] before the valley of the son of Hinnom, [and] which [is] in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En-rogel,

\[18]And passed along towards the side over against Arabah northward, and went down to Arabah:
\[19]And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward: and the limits of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan. This [was] the south border.
\[20]And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This [was] the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the limits of it round about, according to their families.
\[21]Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin, according to their families, were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and the valley of Keziz,

\[9]Out of the portion of the children of Judah [was] the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them.

\[23]This [is] the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages.
\[24]And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.

\[47]And the border of the children of Dan, went out [too little] for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt in it, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.
\[48]This [is] the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
\[49]When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their borders, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:
\[50]According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, [even] Timnath-serah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt in it.
\[51]These [are] the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country.

\[2]Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint for you cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you by the hand of Moses:
\[3]That the slayer that killeth [any] person unawares [and] ignorantly, may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.
\[4]And when he that doth flee to one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city to them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.
\[5]And if the avenger of blood shall pursue him, then they shall not deliver the slayer into his hand; because he smote his neighbor ignorantly, and had not hated him before.
\[6]And he shall dwell in that city, until he shall stand before the congregation for judgment, [and] until the death of the high-priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city from whence he fled.
\[7]And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjath-arba, (which [is] Hebron) in the mountain of Judah.
\[8]And on the other side of Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
\[9]These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger sojourning among them, that whoever should kill [any] person unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.

\[2]And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for our cattle.
\[3]And the children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their suburbs.
\[4]And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, [who were] of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.

\[12]But the fields of the city, and its villages, they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.

\[29]Jarmuth with its suburbs, En-gannim with its suburbs; four cities.
\[30]And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs, Abdon with its suburbs,
\[31]Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs; four cities.

\[39]Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs; four cities in all.
\[40]So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were [by] their lot twelve cities.
\[41]All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel [were] forty and eight cities with their suburbs.
\[42]These cities were every one with their suburbs around them. Thus [were] all these cities.
\[43]And the LORD gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers: and they possessed it, and dwelt in it.
\[44]And the LORD gave them rest on all sides, according to all that he swore to their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.

hen Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
\[2]And said to them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:
\[3]Ye have not left your brethren these many days to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.
\[4]And now the LORD your God hath given rest to your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and go to your tents, [and] to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of Jordan.
\[5]But take diligent heed to perform the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave to him, and to serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul.
\[6]So Joshua blessed them and sent them away; and they went to their tents.
\[7]Now to the [one] half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given [possession] in Bashan: but to the [other] half of it gave Joshua among their brethren on this side of Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also to their tents, then he blessed them,
\[8]And he spoke to them, saying, Return with much riches to your tents, and with very many cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.
\[9]And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which [is] in the land of Canaan, to go to the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, of which they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
\[10]And when they came to the borders of Jordan, that [are] in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to the sight.
\[11]And the children of Israel heard it said, Behold, the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.
\[12]And when the children of Israel heard [of it], the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.
\[13]And the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
\[14]And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one [was] a head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.
\[15]And they came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,
\[16]Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass [is] this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have built you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD?
\[17][Is] the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,
\[18]But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, [seeing] ye rebel to-day against the LORD, that to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.
\[19]Not withstanding, if the land of your possession [is] unclean, [then] pass ye over to the land of the possession of the LORD, in which the LORD'S tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar besides the altar of the LORD our God.
\[20]Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fall on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.
\[21]Then the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and said to the heads of the thousands of Israel,
\[22]The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if [it is] in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)
\[23]That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer on it burnt-offering, or meat-offering, or if to offer peace-offerings on it, let the LORD himself require [it];
\[24]And if we have not [rather] done it for fear of [this] thing, saying, In time to come your children may speak to our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?
\[25]For the LORD hath made Jordan a boundary between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD. So shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.
\[26]Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice:
\[27]But [that] it [may be] a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we may do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD.
\[28]Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they shall [so] say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offerings, nor for sacrifices; but [it is] a witness between us and you.
\[29]Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt-offerings, for meat-offerings, or for sacrifices, besides the altar of the LORD our God that [is] before his tabernacle.
\[30]And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, and heads of the thousands of Israel who [were] with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them.
\[31]And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD [is] among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.
\[32]And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, from the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
\[33]And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.
\[34]And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar [Ed]: for it [shall be] a witness between us that the LORD [is] God.

\[2]And Joshua called for all Israel, [and] for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said to them, I am old [and] advanced in age:
\[3]And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done to all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God [is] he that hath fought for you.
\[4]Behold, I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea westward.
\[5]And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised to you.
\[6]Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside from it [to] the right hand or [to] the left;
\[7]That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear [by them], neither serve them, nor bow yourselves to them:
\[8]But cleave to the LORD your God, as ye have done to this day.
\[9]For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but [as for] you, no man hath been able to stand before you to this day.
\[10]One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he [it is] that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.
\[11]Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God.
\[12]Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave to the remnant of these nations, [even] these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and associate with them, and they with you:
\[13]Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out [any of] these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps to you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.
\[14]And behold, this day I [am] going the way of all the earth; and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spoke concerning you: all are come to pass to you, [and] not one thing hath failed of it.
\[15]Therefore it shall come to pass, [that] as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he hath destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.
\[16]When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given to you.

nd Joshua convened all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
\[2]And Joshua said to all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, [even] Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor: and they served other gods.
\[3]And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.
\[4]And I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
\[5]I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.
\[6]And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red sea.
\[7]And when they cried to the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.
\[8]And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt on the other side of Jordan, and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.
\[9]Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:
\[10]But I would not hearken to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.
\[11]And ye went over Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, and I delivered them into your hand.
\[12]And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, [even] the two kings of the Amorites; [but] not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.
\[13]And I have given you a land for which ye did not labor, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and olive-yards which ye planted not do ye eat.
\[14]Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.
\[15]And if it seemeth evil to you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that [were] on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.
\[16]And the people answered, and said, Be it far from us that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;
\[17]For the LORD our God, he [it is] that brought us, and our fathers, out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way in which we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:
\[18]And the LORD drove out from before us all the people, even the Amorites who dwelt in the land: [therefore] will we also serve the LORD; for he [is] our God.
\[19]And Joshua said to the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he [is] a holy God; he [is] a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions, nor your sins.
\[20]If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.
\[21]And the people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve the LORD.
\[22]And Joshua said to the people, Ye [are] witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, [We are] witnesses.
\[23]Now therefore put away ([said he]) the strange gods which [are] among you, and incline your heart to the LORD God of Israel.
\[24]And the people said to Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.
\[25]So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
\[26]And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak that [was] by the sanctuary of the LORD.
\[27]And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spoke to us, it shall be therefore a witness to you, lest ye deny your God.
\[28]So Joshua let the people depart, every man to his inheritance.
\[29]And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun the servant of the LORD died, [being] a hundred and ten years old.
\[30]And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which [is] in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.
\[31]And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and who had known all the works of the LORD that he had done for Israel.
\[32]And the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel brought out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver; and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
\[33]And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill [that pertained] to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.

ow after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first to fight against them?
\[2]And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
\[3]And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
\[4]And Judah went up, and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.
\[5]And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
\[6]But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
\[7]And Adoni-bezek said, seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered [their food] under my table; as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.
\[8](Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.)
\[9]And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt on the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.
\[10]And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before [was] Kirjath-arba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
\[11]And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before [was] Kirjath-sepher:
\[12]And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter for a wife.
\[13]And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.
\[14]And it came to pass, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off [her] ass; and Caleb said to her, What wilt thou?
\[15]And she said to him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.
\[16]And the children of the Kenite, Moses's father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which [lieth] in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.
\[17]And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.
\[18]Also Judah took Gaza with its border, and Askelon with its border, and Ekron with its border.
\[19]And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out [the inhabitants of] the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
\[20]And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.
\[21]And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
\[22]And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el: and the LORD [was] with them.
\[23]And the house of Joseph sent to explore Beth-el. Now the name of the city before [was] Luz.
\[24]And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will show thee mercy.
\[25]And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword: but they let go the man and all his family.
\[26]And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name of it Luz: which [is] its name to this day.
\[27]Neither did Manasseh expel [the inhabitants of] Beth-shean and its towns, nor Tanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
\[28]And it came to pass when Israel was strong, that they subjected the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly expel them.
\[29]Neither did Ephraim expel the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
\[30]Neither did Zebulun expel the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.
\[31]Neither did Asher expel the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:
\[32]But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not expel them.
\[33]Neither did Naphtali expel the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries to them.
\[34]And the Amorites forced the children of Dan to the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:
\[35]But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Ajalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.
\[36]And the border of the Amorites [was] from the ascent to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.

nd an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to depart from Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.
\[2]And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?
\[3]Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be [as thorns] in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.
\[4]And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
\[5]And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there to the LORD.
\[6]And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.
\[7]And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.
\[8]And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, [being] a hundred and ten years old.
\[9]And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.
\[10]And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.
\[11]And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:
\[12]And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that [were] around them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked the LORD to anger.
\[13]And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
\[14]And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies around, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
\[15]Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them: and they were greatly distressed.
\[16]Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, who delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.
\[17]And yet they would not hearken to their judges, but they went astray after other gods, and bowed themselves to them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; [but] they did not so.
\[18]And when the LORD raised up judges for them, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: (for the LORD repented because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and burdened them.)
\[19]And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, [that] they returned, and corrupted [themselves] more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.
\[20]And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened to my voice;
\[21]I also will not henceforth drive out from before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died:
\[22]That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk in it, as their fathers kept [it], or not.
\[23]Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out speedily, neither did he deliver them into the hand of Joshua.

ow these [are] the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, ([even] as many [of Israel] as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
\[2]Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing of it;)
\[3][Namely], five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt on mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath.
\[4]And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken to the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
\[5]And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:
\[6]And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
\[7]And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim, and the groves.
\[8]Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.
\[9]And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, [even] Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
\[10]And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.
\[11]And the land had rest forty years: and Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
\[12]And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.
\[13]And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm-trees.
\[14]So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
\[15]But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjaminite, a man left-handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon king of Moab.
\[16]But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
\[17]And he brought the present to Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon [was] a very fat man.
\[18]And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bore the present.
\[19]But he himself turned again from the quarries that [were] by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand to thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
\[20]And Ehud came to him; and he was sitting in a summer-parlor, which he had for himself alone: and Ehud said, I have a message from God to thee. And he arose from [his] seat.
\[21]And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:
\[22]And the haft also entered after the blade: and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
\[23]Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlor upon him, and locked them.
\[24]When he had gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlor [were] locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer-chamber.
\[25]And they tarried till they were ashamed: and behold, he opened not the doors of the parlor, therefore they took a key and opened [them]: and behold, their lord lay dead on the earth.
\[26]And Ehud escaped while they tarried; and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirath.
\[27]And it came to pass when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.
\[28]And he said to them, Follow me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan towards Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.
\[29]And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valor: and there escaped not a man.
\[30]So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel: and the land had rest eighty years.
\[31]And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad; and he also delivered Israel.

nd the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud was dead.
\[2]And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan that reigned in Hazor, the captain of whose host [was] Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
\[3]And the children of Israel cried to the LORD; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.
\[4]And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
\[5]And she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Beth-el in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
\[6]And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, [saying], Go, and draw towards mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali, and of the children of Zebulun?
\[7]And I will draw to thee, to the river Kishon, Sisera the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thy hand.
\[8]And Barak said to her, if thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, [then] I will not go.
\[9]And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thy honor; for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
\[10]And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.
\[11]Now Heber the Kenite, [who was] of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent to the plain of Zaanaim, which [is] by Kedesh.
\[12]And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to mount Tabor.
\[13]And Sisera collected all his chariots, [even] nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that [were] with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the river of Kishon.
\[14]And Deborah said to Barak, Arise, for this [is] the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thy hand: hath not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
\[15]And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all [his] chariots, and all [his] host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera alighted from [his] chariot, and fled away on his feet.
\[16]But Barak pursued the chariots, and the host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; [and] there was not a man left.
\[17]Howbeit, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for [there was] peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
\[18]And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in to her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.
\[19]And he said to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
\[20]Again he said to her, stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.
\[21]Then Jael, Heber's wife, took a nail of the tent, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep, and weary. So he died.
\[22]And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her [tent], behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail [was] in his temples.
\[23]So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
\[24]And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

\[2]Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.
\[3]Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, [even] I, will sing to the LORD; I will sing [praise] to the LORD God of Israel.
\[4]LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.
\[5]The mountains melted from before the LORD, [even] that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.
\[6]In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through by-ways.
\[7][The inhabitants of] the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.
\[8]They chose new gods; then [was] war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?

\[10]Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.
\[11][They that are delivered] from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, [even] the righteous acts [towards the inhabitants] of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.
\[12]Awake, awake, Deborah; awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.

\[15]And the princes of Issachar [were] with Deborah: even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben [there were] great thoughts of heart.
\[16]Why abodest thou among the sheep-folds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben [there were] great searchings of heart.
\[17]Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea-shore, and abode in his breaches.
\[18]Zebulun and Naphtali [were] a people [that] jeoparded their lives to death in the high places of the field.
\[19]The kings came [and] fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Tanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.
\[20]They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.
\[21]The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.
\[22]Then were the horse's hoofs broken by the means of the prancings, the prancings of their mighty ones.
\[23]Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly its inhabitants; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.
\[24]Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
\[25]He asked water, [and] she gave [him] milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.
\[26]She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and struck through his temples.
\[27]At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
\[28]The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot [so] long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
\[29]Her wise ladies answered her, yes, she returned answer to herself.
\[30]Have they not found; have they [not] divided the prey; to every man a damsel [or] two; to Sisera a prey of divers colors, a prey of divers colors of needle-work, of divers colors of needle-work on both sides, [meet] for the necks of [them that take] the spoil?
\[31]So let all thy enemies perish, O LORD: but [let] them that love him [be] as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.

nd the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
\[2]And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: [and] because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which [are] in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.
\[3]And [so] it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;
\[4]And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou comest to Gaza; and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
\[5]For they came up with their cattle, and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; [for] both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.
\[6]And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried to the LORD.
\[7]And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried to the LORD because of the Midianites,
\[8]That the LORD sent a prophet to the children of Israel, who said to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth from the house of bondage;
\[9]And I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;
\[10]And I said to you, I [am] the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.
\[11]And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which [was] in Ophrah, that [pertained] to Joash the Abi-ezrite: and his son Gideon thrashed wheat by the wine-press, to hide [it] from the Midianites.
\[12]And the angel of the LORD appeared to him, and said to him, The LORD [is] with thee, thou mighty man of valor.
\[13]And Gideon said to him, O my Lord, if the LORD is with us, why then hath all this befallen us? and where [are] all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.
\[14]And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?
\[15]And he said to him, O my Lord, by what means shall I save Israel? behold, my family [is] poor in Manasseh, and I [am] the least in my father's house.
\[16]And the LORD said to him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.
\[17]And he said to him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then show me a sign that thou talkest with me.
\[18]Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come to thee, and bring forth my present, and set [it] before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou comest again.
\[19]And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought [it] out to him under the oak, and presented [it].
\[20]And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay [them] upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.
\[21]Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that [was] in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed from his sight.
\[22]And when Gideon perceived that he was [an] angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.
\[23]And the LORD said to him, Peace [be] to thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.
\[24]Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it Jehovah-shalom: to this day it [is] yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.
\[25]And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that [is] by it:
\[26]And build an altar to the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.
\[27]Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said to him: and [so] it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do [it] by day, that he did [it] by night.
\[28]And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that [was] by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar [that was] built.
\[29]And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.
\[30]Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that [was] by it.
\[31]And Joash said to all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst [it is yet] morning: if he [is] a god, let him plead for himself, because [one] hath cast down his altar.
\[32]Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.
\[33]Then all the Midianites, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east were assembled, and went over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.
\[34]But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was called after him.
\[35]And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was called after him: and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
\[36]And Gideon said to God, If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said,
\[37]Behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the floor; [and] if the dew shall be on the fleece only, and [it] shall [be] dry upon all the earth [besides], then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said.
\[38]And it was so: for he rose early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl-full of water.
\[39]And Gideon said to God, Let not thy anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: Let me make trial, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
\[40]And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.

hen Jerubbaal (who [is] Gideon) and all the people that [were] with him, rose early, and encamped beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
\[2]And the LORD said to Gideon, The people that [are] with thee [are] too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand hath saved me.
\[3]Now therefore, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever [is] fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
\[4]And the LORD said to Gideon, The people [are] yet [too] many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for thee there; and it shall be, [that] of whom I say to thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say to thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
\[5]So he brought down the people to the water: and the LORD said to Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.
\[6]And the number of them that lapped, [putting] their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.
\[7]And the LORD said to Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand: and let all the [other] people go every man to his place.
\[8]So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent of all [the rest of] Israel every man to his tent, and retained those three hundred men. And the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
\[9]And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Arise, go down to the host; for I have delivered it into thy hand.
\[10]But if thou fearest to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:
\[11]And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go down to the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men that [were] in the host.
\[12]And the Midianites, and the Amalekites, and all the children of the east, lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels [were] without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.
\[13]And when Gideon had come, behold, [there was] a man that told a dream to his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and lo, a cake of barley-bread rolled into the host of Midian, and came to a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it that the tent lay along.
\[14]And his fellow answered, and said, This [is] nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: [for] into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.
\[15]And it was [so], when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and its interpretation, that he worshiped, and returned to the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.
\[16]And he divided the three hundred men [into] three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.
\[17]And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise: and behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be [that] as I do, so shall ye do.
\[18]When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that [are] with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, [The sword] of the LORD, and of Gideon.
\[19]So Gideon, and the hundred men that [were] with him, came to the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers that [were] in their hands.
\[20]And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow [with]: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.
\[21]And they stood every man in his place around the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.
\[22]And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zereroth, [and] to the border of Abel-meholah, to Tabbath.
\[23]And the men of Israel assembled out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued the Midianites.
\[24]And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters to Beth-barah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim assembled, and took the waters to Beth-barah and Jordan.
\[25]And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the wine-press of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of Jordan.

nd the men of Ephraim said to him, Why hast thou treated us thus, that thou calledst us not when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? and they chid with him sharply.
\[2]And he said to them, What have I done now in comparison of you? [Is] not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
\[3]God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then, when he had said that, their anger towards him abated.
\[4]And Gideon came to Jordan, [and] passed over, he, and the three hundred men that [were] with him, faint, yet pursuing [them].
\[5]And he said to the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread to the people that follow me: for they [are] faint, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.
\[6]And the princes of Succoth said, [Are] the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy army?
\[7]And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.
\[8]And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke to them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered [him].
\[9]And he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.
\[10]Now Zebah and Zalmunna [were] in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand [men], all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.
\[11]And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure.
\[12]And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.
\[13]And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun [had risen],
\[14]And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described to him the princes of Succoth, and its elders, [even] seventy seven men.
\[15]And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye upbraided me, saying, [Are] the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy men [that are] weary?
\[16]And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness, and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
\[17]And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.
\[18]Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men [were they] whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou [art], so [were] they; each one resembled the children of a king.
\[19]And he said, They [were] my brethren, [even] the sons of my mother: [as] the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.
\[20]And he said to Jether his first-born, Arise, [and] slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he [was] yet a youth.
\[21]Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man [is], [so is] his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that [were] on their camels' necks.
\[22]Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.
\[23]And Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.
\[24]And Gideon said to them, I would desire a request of you, that you would give me every man the ear-rings of his prey. (For they had golden ear-rings, because they [were] Ishmaelites.)
\[25]And they answered, We will willingly give [them]. And they spread a garment, and cast into it every man the ear-rings of his prey.
\[26]And the weight of the golden ear-rings that he requested, was a thousand and seven hundred [shekels] of gold; besides ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that [was] on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that [were] about their camels' necks.
\[27]And Gideon made of it an ephod, and put it in his city, [even] in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither astray after it: which thing became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.
\[28]Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they raised their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.
\[29]And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
\[30]And Gideon had seventy sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.
\[31]And his concubine that [was] in Shechem, she also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.
\[32]And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulcher of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.
\[33]And it came to pass as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went astray after Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.
\[34]And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side:
\[35]Neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, [namely] Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel.

nd Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
\[2]Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Which [is] better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, [which are] seventy persons, should reign over you, or that one should reign over you? remember also that I [am] your bone and your flesh.
\[3]And his mother's brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He [is] our brother.
\[4]And they gave him seventy [pieces] of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light persons, who followed him.
\[5]And he went to his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, [being] seventy persons, upon one stone; notwithstanding, yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
\[6]And all the men of Shechem assembled, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that [was] in Shechem.
\[7]And when they told [it] to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice and cried, and said to them, Hearken to me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken to you.
\[8]The trees went forth [on a time] to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive-tree, Reign thou over us.
\[9]But the olive-tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honor God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
\[10]And the trees said to the fig-tree, Come thou, [and] reign over us.
\[11]But the fig-tree said to them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?
\[12]Then said the trees to the vine, Come thou, [and] reign over us.
\[13]And the vine said to them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
\[14]Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come thou, [and] reign over us.
\[15]And the bramble said to the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, [then] come [and] put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
\[16]Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands:
\[17](For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you from the hand of Midian:
\[18]And ye have risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid-servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he [is] your brother:)
\[19]If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, [then] rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:
\[20]But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.
\[21]And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
\[22]When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,
\[23]Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
\[24]That the cruelty [done] to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother who slew them, and upon the men of Shechem who aided him in the killing of his brethren.
\[25]And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him on the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.
\[26]And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.
\[27]And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trod [the grapes], and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.
\[28]And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who [is] Abimelech, and who [is] Shechem, that we should serve him; [is] not [he] the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?
\[29]And would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thy army, and come out.
\[30]And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
\[31]And he sent messengers to Abimelech privately, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed, and his brethren, are come to Shechem; and behold, they fortify the city against thee.
\[32]Now therefore rise by night, thou, and the people that [are] with thee, and lie in wait in the field:
\[33]And it shall be, [that] in the morning, as soon as the sun hath risen, thou shalt rise early, and attack the city: and behold, [when] he and the people that [are] with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
\[34]And Abimelech rose, and all the people that [were] with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
\[35]And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose, and the people that [were] with him, from lying in wait.
\[36]And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said to him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as [if they were] men.
\[37]And Gaal spoke again, and said, See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.
\[38]Then said Zebul to him, Where [is] now thy mouth, with which thou saidst, Who [is] Abimelech, that we should serve him? [are] not these the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.
\[39]And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
\[40]And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown [and] wounded, [even] to the entrance of the gate.
\[41]And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
\[42]And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
\[43]And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and behold, the people [had] come out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.
\[44]And Abimelech, and the company that [was] with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two [other] companies ran upon all [the people] that [were] in the fields, and slew them.
\[45]And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that [were] in it, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
\[46]And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard [that], they entered into a hold of the house of the god Berith.
\[47]And it was told to Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were assembled.
\[48]And Abimelech ascended mount Zalmon, he and all the people that [were] with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid [it] on his shoulder, and said to the people that [were] with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, [and] do as I [have done].
\[49]And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put [them] to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them: so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
\[50]Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
\[51]But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut [it] after them, and ascended to the top of the tower.
\[52]And Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and came near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
\[53]And a certain woman cast a piece of of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and broke his skull.
\[54]Then he called hastily to the young man his armor-bearer, and said to him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
\[55]And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.
\[56]Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:
\[57]And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.

\[3]And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.

\[7]And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.

\[10]And the children of Israel cried to the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.
\[11]And the LORD said to the children of Israel, [Did] not [I deliver you] from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
\[12]The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites oppressed you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.
\[13]Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more.
\[14]Go and cry to the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.
\[15]And the children of Israel said to the LORD, We have sinned: do thou to us whatever seemeth good to thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day.
\[16]And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
\[17]Then the children of Ammon were assembled, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves, and encamped in Mizpeh.

\[2]And Gilead's wife bore him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said to him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou [art] the son of a strange woman.
\[3]Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and [they] went out with him.
\[4]And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
\[5]And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah out of the land of Tob:
\[6]And they said to Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
\[7]And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Did ye not hate me, and expel me from my father's house; and why have ye come to me now when ye are in distress?
\[8]And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

\[11]Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.
\[12]And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou hast come against me to fight in my land?
\[13]And the king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came out of Egypt, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and to Jordan: now therefore restore those [lands] again peaceably.
\[14]And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon:
\[15]And said to him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:
\[16]But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness to the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;
\[17]Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken [to it]. And in like manner they sent to the king of Moab; but he would not [consent]. And Israel abode in Kadesh.
\[18]Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon [was] the border of Moab.
\[19]And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land to my place.
\[20]But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon collected all his people, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
\[21]And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
\[22]And they possessed all the borders of the Amorites, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to Jordan.
\[23]So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldst thou possess it?
\[24]Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.
\[25]And now [art] thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,
\[26]While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that [are] along by the borders of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover [them] within that time?
\[27]Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
\[28]But, the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
\[29]Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over [to] the children of Ammon.
\[30]And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,
\[31]Then it shall be, that whatever cometh out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD'S, and I will offer it for a burnt-offering.
\[32]So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.
\[33]And he smote them from Aroer even till thou comest to Minnith, [even] twenty cities, and to the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
\[34]And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she [was his] only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
\[35]And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot go back.
\[36]And she said to him, My father, [if] thou hast opened thy mouth to the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thy enemies, [even] of the children of Ammon.
\[37]And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: Let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.
\[38]And he said, Go. And he sent her away [for] two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
\[39]And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her [according] to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,
\[40][That] the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.

nd the men of Ephraim assembled, and went northward, and said to Jephthah, Why didst thou pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee; we will burn thy house upon thee with fire.
\[2]And Jephthah said to them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.
\[3]And when I saw that ye delivered [me] not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: why then have ye come up to me this day, to fight against me?
\[4]Then Jephthah collected all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites [are] fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, [and] among the Manassites.
\[5]And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was [so], that when those Ephraimites who had escaped, said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said to him, [Art] thou an Ephraimite? If he said, No;
\[6]Then said they to him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce [it] right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan. And there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.
\[7]And Jephthah judged Israel six years: then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in [one of] the cities of Gilead.
\[8]And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel.
\[9]And he had thirty sons and thirty daughters [whom] he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons: and he judged Israel seven years.
\[10]Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Beth-lehem.
\[11]And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years.
\[12]And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Ajalon in the country of Zebulun.
\[13]And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.
\[14]And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on seventy ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.
\[15]And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.

nd the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
\[2]And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name [was] Manoah; and his wife [was] barren, and bore not.
\[3]And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold, now, thou [art] barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.
\[4]Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine, nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean [thing]:
\[5]For lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from his birth: and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.
\[6]Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance [was] like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he [was], neither did he tell me his name:
\[7]But he said to me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean [thing]: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from his birth to the day of his death.
\[8]Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God, whom thou didst send come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child that shall be born.
\[9]And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband [was] not with her.
\[10]And the woman made haste, and ran, and showed her husband, and said to him, Behold, the man hath appeared to me, that came to me the [other] day.
\[11]And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, [Art] thou the man that didst speak to the woman? And he said, I [am].
\[12]And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and [how] shall we do to him?
\[13]And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman, let her beware.
\[14]She may not eat of any [thing] that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean [thing]; all that I commanded her let her observe.
\[15]And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.
\[16]And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Though thou shouldst detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt-offering, thou must offer it to the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he [was] an angel of the LORD.
\[17]And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, What [is] thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass, we may do thee honor?
\[18]And the angel of the LORD said to him, why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it [is] secret?
\[19]So Manoah took a kid, with a meat-offering, and offered [it] upon a rock to the LORD; and [the angel] did wonderously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.
\[20]For it came to pass, when the flame ascended towards heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on [it], and fell on their faces to the ground.
\[21]But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he [was] an angel of the LORD.
\[22]And Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
\[23]But his wife said to him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meat-offering at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these [things], nor would, as at this time, have told us [such things] as these.
\[24]And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.
\[25]And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.

nd Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.
\[2]And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me for a wife.
\[3]Then his father and his mother said to him, [Is there] not a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said to his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.
\[4]But his father and his mother knew not that it [was] of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.
\[5]Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and behold, a young lion roared against him.
\[6]And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and [he had] nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.
\[7]And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.
\[8]And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and behold, [there was] a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion.
\[9]And he took of it in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they ate: but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.
\[10]So his father went down to the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
\[11]And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
\[12]And Samson said to them, I will now propose a riddle to you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find [it] out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:
\[13]But if ye cannot declare [it] to me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said to him, propose thy riddle, that we may hear it.
\[14]And he said to them, Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.
\[15]And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take what we possess? [is it] not [so]?
\[16]And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast proposed a riddle to the children of my people, and hast not told [it] to me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not told [it] to my father nor to my mother, and shall I tell [it] to thee?
\[17]And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she urged him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
\[18]And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What [is] sweeter than honey? and what [is] stronger than a lion? And he said to them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.
\[19]And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments to them who expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.

ut it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat-harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.
\[2]And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: [is] not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.
\[3]And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.
\[4]And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took fire-brands, and turned tail to tail, and put a fire-brand in the midst between two tails.
\[5]And when he had set the brands on fire, he let [them] go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and also the standing corn, with the vineyards [and] olives.
\[6]Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
\[7]And Samson said to them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.
\[8]And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter. And he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.
\[9]Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
\[10]And the men of Judah said, Why have ye come up against us? And they answered, We have come to bind Samson, to do to him as he hath done to us.
\[11]Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines [are] rulers over us? what [is] this [that] thou hast done to us? And he said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.
\[12]And they said to him, We have come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.
\[13]And they spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.
\[14][And] when he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that [were] upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his the hands.
\[15]And he found a fresh jaw-bone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men with it.
\[16]And Samson said, With the jaw-bone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.
\[17]And it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jaw-bone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath-lehi.
\[18]And he was very thirsty, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die by thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?
\[19]But God cleaved a hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water out of it; and when he had drank, his spirit came again, and he revived. Wherefore he called the name of it En-hakkore, which [is] in Lehi to this day.
\[20]And he judged Israel, in the days of the Philistines, twenty years.

\[2][And it was told] the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they encompassed [him], and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning when it is day we shall kill him.
\[3]And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put [them] upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of a hill that [is] before Hebron.
\[4]And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name [was] Delilah.
\[5]And the lords of the Philistines came to her, and said to her, Entice him, and see in what his great strength [lieth], and by what [means] we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred [pieces] of silver.
\[6]And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, in what thy great strength [lieth], and with what thou mayest be bound to afflict thee.
\[7]And Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven green withs, that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.
\[8]Then the lords of the Philistines brought to her seven green withs, which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
\[9](Now [there were] men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.) And she said to him, The Philistines [are] upon thee, Samson. And he broke the withs as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.
\[10]And Delilah said to Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, with what thou mayest be bound.
\[11]And he said to her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were used, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.
\[12]Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him with them, and said to him, The Philistines [are] upon thee, Samson. (And [there were] liers in wait abiding in the chamber.) And he broke them from off his arms like a thread.
\[13]And Delilah said to Samson, hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me with what thou mayest be bound. And he said to her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.
\[14]And she fastened [it] with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines [are] upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.
\[15]And she said to him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thy heart [is] not with me? Thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me in what thy great strength [lieth].
\[16]And it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, [so] that his soul was vexed to death;
\[17]That he told her all his heart, and said to her, There hath not come a razor upon my head; for I [have been] a Nazarite to God from my birth: if I be shaved, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any [other] man.
\[18]And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath disclosed to me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought money in their hand.
\[19]And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
\[20]And she said, the Philistines [are] upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he knew not that the LORD had departed from him.
\[21]But the Philistines took him and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house.
\[22]However the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaved.
\[23]Then the lords of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.
\[24]And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country; who slew many of us.
\[25]And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.
\[26]And Samson said to the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars upon which the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.
\[27]Now the house was full of men and women: and all the lords of the Philistines [were] there: and [there were] upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.
\[28]And Samson called to the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.
\[29]And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was supported, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.
\[30]And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with [all his] might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that [were] in it. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than [they] which he slew in his life.
\[31]Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought [him] up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.

\[3]And when he had restored the eleven hundred [shekels] of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it to thee.
\[4]Yet he restored the money to his mother; and his mother took two hundred [shekels] of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made of it a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.

n those days [there was] no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought for themselves an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day [all their] inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.
\[2]And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their borders, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to explore the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.
\[3]When they [were] by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said to him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this [place]? and what hast thou here?
\[4]And he said to them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.
\[5]And they said to him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
\[6]And the priest said to them, Go in peace: before the LORD [is] your way in which ye go.
\[7]Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that [were] in it, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and [there was] no magistrate in the land, that might put [them] to shame in [any] thing; and they [were] far from the Zidonians, and had no business with [any] man.
\[8]And they came to their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said to them, What [say] ye?
\[9]And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and behold, it [is] very good: and [are] ye still? be not slothful to go, [and] to enter to possess the land.
\[10]When ye go, ye shall come to a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where [there] is no want of any thing that [is] on the earth.
\[11]And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.
\[12]And they went up, and encamped in Kirjath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan to this day: behold, [it is] behind Kirjath-jearim.
\[13]And they passed thence to mount Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
\[14]Then answered the five men that went to explore the country of Laish, and said to their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.
\[15]And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, [even] to the house of Micah, and saluted him.
\[16]And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, who [were] of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.
\[17]And the five men that went to explore the land went up, [and] came in thither, [and] took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men [that were] appointed with weapons of war.
\[18]And these went into Micah's house, and brought the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest to them, What do ye?
\[19]And they said to him, Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: [Is it] better for thee to be a priest to the house of one man, or that thou shouldst be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?
\[20]And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.
\[21]So they turned and departed, and put the little ones, and the cattle, and the furniture before them.
\[22][And] when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that [were] in the houses near to Micah's house were collected, and overtook the children of Dan.
\[23]And they cried to the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said to Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?
\[24]And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye have gone away: and what have I more? and what [is] this [that] ye say to me, What aileth thee?
\[25]And the children of Dan said to him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows rush upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.
\[26]And the children of Dan departed: and when Micah saw that they [were] too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.
\[27]And they took [the things] which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came to Laish, to a people [that were] at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.
\[28]And [there was] no deliverer, because it [was] far from Zidon, and they had no business with [any] man; and it was in the valley that [lieth] by Beth-rehob. And they built a city and dwelt in it.
\[29]And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: but the name of the city [was] Laish at the first.
\[30]And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.
\[31]And they set up for themselves Micah's graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

nd it came to pass in those days, when [there was] no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite dwelling on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah.
\[2]And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him to her father's house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there four whole months.
\[3]And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her, [and] to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
\[4]And his father-in-law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they ate and drank, and lodged there.
\[5]And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he arose to depart: and the damsel's father said to his son-in-law, Comfort thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward depart.
\[6]And they sat down, and ate and drank both of them together: for the damsel's father had said to the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.
\[7]And when the man rose to depart, his father-in-law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.
\[8]And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel's father said, Comfort thy heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they ate both of them.
\[9]And when the man arose to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said to him, Behold now the day draweth towards evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day is coming to an end, lodge here, that thy heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.
\[10]But the man would not tarry that night, but he arose and departed, and came over against Jebus, which [is] Jerusalem; and [there were] with him two asses saddled, his concubine also [was] with him.
\[11][And] when they [were] by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in to this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
\[12]And his master said to him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that [is] not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.
\[13]And he said to his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
\[14]And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them [when they were] by Gibeah, which [belongeth] to Benjamin.
\[15]And they turned aside thither, to go in [and] to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat down in a street of the city: for [there was] no man that took them into his house to lodge.
\[16]And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening, who [was] also of mount Ephraim; and he dwelt in Gibeah: but the men of the place [were] Benjaminites.
\[17]And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a way-faring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?
\[18]And he said to him, We [are] passing from Beth-lehem-Judah towards the side of mount Ephraim; from thence [am] I: and I went to Beth-lehem-judah, but I [am now] going to the house of the LORD; and there [is] no man that receiveth me into [his] house.
\[19]Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man [which is] with thy servants: [there is] no want of any thing:
\[20]And the old man said, Peace [be] with thee; however, [let] all thy wants [lie] upon me; only lodge not in the street.
\[21]So he brought him into his house, and gave provender to the asses: and they washed their feet and ate and drank.
\[22][Now] as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house on all sides, [and] beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him.
\[23]And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, Nay, my brethren, [nay], I pray you, do not [so] wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly.
\[24]Behold, [here] is my daughter, a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good to you: but to this man do not so vile a thing.
\[25]But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.
\[26]Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord [was], till it was light.
\[27]And her lord rose in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and behold, the woman his concubine had fallen down [at] the door of the house, and her hands [were] upon the threshhold.
\[28]And he said to her, Rise, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her upon an ass, and the man rose, and went to his place.
\[29]And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the borders of Israel.
\[30]And it was so, that all that saw it, said, There hath been no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came from the land of Egypt to this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak [your minds].

hen all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, to the LORD in Mizpeh.
\[2]And the chief of all the people, [even] of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
\[3](Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell [us], how was this wickedness?
\[4]And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that [belongeth] to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
\[5]And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house upon me by night, [and] thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.
\[6]And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
\[7]Behold, ye [are] all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.
\[8]And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any [of us] go to his tent, neither will we any [of us] turn into his house:
\[9]But now this [shall be] the thing which we will do to Gibeah: [we will go up] by lot against it;
\[10]And we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch provisions for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.
\[11]So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
\[12]And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness [is] this that is done among you?
\[13]Now therefore deliver [us] the men, the children of Belial, who [are] in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and banish evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren, the children of Israel:
\[14]But the children of Benjamin assembled out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.
\[15]And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
\[16]Among all this people [there were] seven hundred chosen men left-handed; every one could sling stones to a hair-[breadth], and not miss.
\[17]And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these [were] men of war.
\[18]And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah [shall go up] first.
\[19]And the children of Israel rose in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.
\[20]And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.
\[21]And the children of Benjamin came forth from Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.
\[22]And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.
\[23](And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)
\[24]And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.
\[25]And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
\[26]Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until evening, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before the LORD.
\[27]And the children of Israel inquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God [was] there in those days,
\[28]And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to-morrow I will deliver them into thy hand.
\[29]And Israel set liers in wait around Gibeah.
\[30]And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
\[31]And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, [and] were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, [and] kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
\[32]And the children of Benjamin said, They [are] smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city to the highways.
\[33]And all the men of Israel rose out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, [even] out of the meadows of Gibeah.
\[34]And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was severe: but they knew not that evil [was] near them.
\[35]And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjaminites that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men: all these drew the sword.
\[36]So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjaminites, because they trusted to the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.
\[37]And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew [themselves] along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.
\[38]Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke to rise from the city.
\[39]And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite [and] kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as [in] the first battle.
\[40]But when the flame began to rise from the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjaminites looked behind them, and behold, the flame of the city ascended to heaven.
\[41]And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil had come upon them.
\[42]Therefore they turned [their backs] before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them who [came] out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.
\[43][Thus] they inclosed the Benjaminites on all sides, [and] chased them, [and] trod them down with ease over against Gibeah towards the sun-rising.
\[44]And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these [were] men of valor.
\[45]And they turned and fled towards the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them to Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.
\[46]So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these [were] men of valor.
\[47]But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness to the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.
\[48]And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of [every] city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.

ow the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin for a wife.
\[2]And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept bitterly;
\[3]And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to-day one tribe lacking in Israel?
\[4]And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings.
\[5]And the children of Israel said, Who [is there] among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation to the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.
\[6]And the children of Israel repented for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
\[7]How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD, that we will not give them of our daughters for wives?
\[8]And they said, What one [is there] of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? and behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.
\[9]For the people were numbered, and behold, [there were] none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.
\[10]And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.
\[11]And this [is] the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.
\[12]And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which [is] in the land of Canaan.
\[13]And the whole congregation sent [some] to speak to the children of Benjamin that [were] in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably to them.
\[14]And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.
\[15]And the people repented for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
\[16]Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?
\[17]And they said, [There must be] an inheritance for them that have escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.
\[18]But, we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed [be] he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.
\[19]Then they said, Behold, [there is] a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly [in a place] which [is] on the north side of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
\[20]Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go, and lie in wait in the vineyards;
\[21]And see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
\[22]And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to us to complain, that we will say to them, Be favorable to them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give to them at this time, [that] ye should be guilty.
\[23]And the children of Benjamin did so, and took [them] wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned to their inheritance, and repaired the cities and dwelt in them.
\[24]And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went from thence every man to his inheritance.
\[25]In those days [there was] no king in Israel: every man did [that which was] right in his own eyes.

ow it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah went to dwell in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
\[2]And the name of the man [was] Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
\[3]And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.
\[4]And they took to themselves wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one [was] Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years.
\[5]And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left by her two sons and her husband.
\[6]Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.
\[7]Wherefore she went forth from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.
\[8]And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
\[9]The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each [of you] in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
\[10]And they said to her, surely we will return with thee to thy people.
\[11]And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? shall I bear more sons, that they may be your husbands?
\[12]Turn again, my daughters, go [your way]; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, [if] I should have a husband also to-night, and should also bear sons;
\[13]Would ye wait for them till they should be grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes, that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me.
\[14]And they lifted up their voice, and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth cleaved to her.
\[15]And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law hath gone back to her people, and to her gods: return thou after thy sister-in-law.
\[16]And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, [or] to return from following thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people [shall be] my people, and thy God my God:
\[17]Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, [if aught] but death shall part thee and me.
\[18]When she saw that she was steadfastly resolved to go with her, then she left speaking to her.
\[19]So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they had come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, [Is] this Naomi?
\[20]And she said to them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
\[21]I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why [then] call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?
\[22]So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley-harvest.

nd Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name [was] Boaz.
\[2]And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after [him] in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said to her, Go, my daughter.
\[3]And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her lot was to light on a part of the field [belonging] to Boaz, who [was] of the kindred of Elimelech.
\[4]And behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said to the reapers, The LORD [be] with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.
\[5]Then said Boaz to his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel [is] this?
\[6]And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It [is] the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi from the country of Moab:
\[7]And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.
\[8]Then said Boaz to Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:
\[9][Let] thy eyes [be] on the field that they are reaping, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art thirsty go to the vessels, and drink of [that] which the young men have drawn.
\[10]Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found grace in thy eyes, that thou shouldst take knowledge of me, seeing I [am] a stranger?
\[11]And Boaz answered and said to her, It hath fully been shown to me, all that thou hast done to thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband: and [how] thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and hast come to a people which thou knewest not heretofore.
\[12]The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou hast come to trust.
\[13]Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken kindly to thy handmaid, though I am not like to one of thy handmaidens.
\[14]And Boaz said to her, At meal-time come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched [corn], and she ate, and was satisfied, and left.
\[15]And when she had risen to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:
\[16]And let fall also [some] of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave [them], that she may glean [them], and rebuke her not.
\[17]So she gleaned in the field until evening, and beat out that which she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.
\[18]And she took [it], and went into the city: and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her what she had reserved after she was satisfied.
\[19]And her mother-in-law said to her, Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where hast thou labored? blessed be he that took knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to-day [is] Boaz.
\[20]And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed [be] he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said to her, The man [is] near of kin to us, one of our next kinsmen.
\[21]And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said to me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
\[22]And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, [It is] good, my daughter, that thou shouldst go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.
\[23]So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean to the end of barley-harvest and of wheat-harvest; and dwelt with her mother-in-law.

\[2]And now [is] not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor.
\[3]Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and go down to the floor: [but] make not thyself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.

\[6]And she went down to the floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.

\[10]And he said, Blessed [be] thou of the LORD, my daughter: [for] thou hast shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou didst not follow young men, whether poor or rich.
\[11]And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou [art] a virtuous woman.
\[12]And now it is true that I [am thy] near kinsman: yet there is a kinsman nearer than I.

\[14]And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came to the floor.
\[15]Also he said, Bring the vail that [thou hast] upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six [measures] of barley, and laid [it] on her: and she went into the city.
\[16]And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who [art] thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.
\[17]And she said, These six [measures] of barley he gave me; for he said to me, Go not empty to thy mother-in-law.
\[18]Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou knowest how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he hath finished the thing this day.

\[7]Now this [was the manner] in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for confirming all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave [it] to his neighbor: and this [was] a testimony in Israel.
\[8]Therefore the kinsman said to Boaz, Buy [it] for thyself. So he drew off his shoe.
\[9]And Boaz said to the elders, and [to] all the people, Ye [are] witnesses this day, that I have bought all that [was] Elimelech's, and all that [was] Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.
\[10]Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye [are] witnesses this day.
\[11]And all the people that [were] in the gate, and the elders said, [We are] witnesses. The LORD make the woman that hath come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Beth-lehem:
\[12]And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.
\[13]So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in to her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.
\[14]And the women said to Naomi, Blessed [be] the LORD, who hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.
\[15]And he shall be to thee a restorer of [thy] life, and a nourisher of thy old age: for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.
\[16]And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became its nurse.
\[17]And the women, her neighbors, gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he [is] the father of Jesse, the father of David.
\[18]Now these [are] the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,
\[19]And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,
\[20]And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
\[21]And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,
\[22]And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.

ow there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name [was] Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
\[2]And he had two wives; the name of the one [was] Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
\[3]And this man went up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, [were] there.
\[4]And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
\[5]But to Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah; but the LORD had rendered her barren.
\[6]And her adversary also provoked her greatly, to make her fret, because the LORD had made her barren.
\[7]And [as] he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
\[8]Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? [am] not I better to thee than ten sons?
\[9]So Hannah rose after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drank. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.
\[10]And she [was] in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, and wept bitterly.
\[11]And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give to thy handmaid a male child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
\[12]And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli observed her mouth.
\[13]Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
\[14]And Eli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
\[15]And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I [am] a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drank neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.
\[16]Count not thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.
\[17]Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant [thee] thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
\[18]And she said, Let thy handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more [sad].
\[19]And they rose in the morning early, and worshiped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.
\[20]Wherefore it came to pass, when the time had arrived, after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel, [saying], Because I have asked him of the LORD.
\[21]And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
\[22]But Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband, [I will not go up] until the child is weaned, and [then] I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.
\[23]And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seemeth to thee good; tarry until thou hast weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and nursed her son until she weaned him.
\[24]And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child [was] young.
\[25]And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
\[26]And she said, O my lord, [as] thy soul liveth, my lord, I [am] the woman that stood by thee here, praying to the LORD.
\[27]For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:
\[28]Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshiped the LORD there.

nd Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD; my mouth is enlarged over my enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.
\[2][There is] none holy as the LORD: for [there is] none besides thee: neither [is there] any rock like our God.
\[3]Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let [not] arrogance come out of your mouth: for the LORD [is] a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
\[4]The bows of the mighty men [are] broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
\[5][They that were] full have hired out themselves for bread; and [they that were] hungry ceased: so that the barren hath borne seven; and she that hath many children is become feeble.
\[6]The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.
\[7]The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.
\[8]He raiseth the poor out of the dust, [and] lifteth the beggar from the dunghill, to set [them] among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth [are] the LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them.
\[9]He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
\[10]The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.
\[11]And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child ministered to the LORD before Eli the priest.
\[12]Now the sons of Eli [were] sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.
\[13]And the priest's custom with the people [was], [that], when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;
\[14]And he struck [it] into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came thither.
\[15]Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw.
\[16]And [if] any man said to him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and [then] take [as much] as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, [No]; but thou shalt give [it to me] now: and if not, I will take [it] by force.
\[17]Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.
\[18]But Samuel ministered before the LORD, [being] a child, girded with a linen ephod.
\[19]Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought [it] to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband, to offer the yearly sacrifice.
\[20]And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee issue of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went to their own home.
\[21]And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.
\[22]Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[23]And he said to them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.
\[24]No, my sons; for [it is] no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD'S people to transgress.
\[25]If one man shall sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man shall sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not to the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.
\[26]And the child Samuel continued to grow, and was in favor both with the LORD, and also with men.
\[27]And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear to the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?
\[28]And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel [to be] my priest, to offer upon my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give to the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?
\[29]Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded [in my] habitation; and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
\[30]Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed [that] thy house, and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
\[31]Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thy arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.
\[32]And thou shalt see an enemy [in my] habitation, in all [the wealth] which [God] shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.
\[33]And the man of thine, [whom] I shall not cut off from my altar, [shall be] to consume thy eyes, and to grieve thy heart: and all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age.
\[34]And this [shall be] a sign to thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.
\[35]And I will raise me up a faithful priest, [that] shall do according to [that] which [is] in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my Anointed for ever.
\[36]And it shall come to pass, [that] every one that is left in thy house, shall come [and] crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priest's offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.

nd the child Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; [there was] no open vision.
\[2]And it came to pass at that time, when Eli [was] laid down in his place, and his eyes began to grow dim, [that] he could not see;
\[3]And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God [was], and Samuel was laid down [to sleep];
\[4]That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here [am] I.
\[5]And he ran to Eli, and said, Here [am] I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
\[6]And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here [am] I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
\[7]Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed to him.
\[8]And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here [am] I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.
\[9]Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he should call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
\[10]And the LORD came, and stood and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
\[11]And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
\[12]In that day I will perform against Eli all [things] which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.
\[13]For I have told him, that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth: because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
\[14]And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
\[15]And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD: and Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.
\[16]Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here [am] I.
\[17]And he said, What [is] the thing that [the LORD] hath said to thee? I pray thee hide [it] not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou shalt hide [any] thing from me, of all the things that he said to thee.
\[18]And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It [is] the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.
\[19]And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.
\[20]And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel [was] established [to be] a prophet of the LORD.
\[21]And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.

nd the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
\[2]And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.
\[3]And when the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why hath the LORD smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh to us, that when it cometh among us, it may save us from the hand of our enemies.
\[4]So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who dwelleth [between] the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, [were] there with the ark of the covenant of God.
\[5]And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth resounded.
\[6]And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What [meaneth] the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp.
\[7]And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God hath come into the camp. And they said, Woe to us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.
\[8]Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these [are] the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
\[9]Be strong, and acquit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye may not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you: acquit yourselves like men, and fight.
\[10]And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
\[11]And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
\[12]And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.
\[13]And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the way-side watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told [it], all the city cried out.
\[14]And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What [meaneth] the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.
\[15]Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.
\[16]And the man said to Eli, I [am] he that came out of the army, and I fled to-day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?
\[17]And the messenger answered and said, Israel hath fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
\[18]And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
\[19]And his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child [near] to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law, and her husband were dead, she bowed herself, and travailed; for her pains came upon her.
\[20]And about the time of her death, the women that stood by her said to her, Fear not; for thou hast borne a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard [it].
\[21]And she named the child I-chabod, saying, The glory hath departed from Israel. (Because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.)

\[4]And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon had fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD: and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands [were] cut off upon the threshhold; only [the stump of] Dagon was left to him.

\[9]And it was [so], that after they had carried it thither, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.

\[4]Then said they, What [shall be] the trespass-offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, [according to] the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague [was] on you all, and on your lords.
\[5]Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory to the God of Israel: it may be he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
\[6]Why then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
\[7]Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch-cows on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:
\[8]And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold which ye return to him [for] a trespass-offering, in a coffer by its side; and send it away, that it may go.

\[10]And the men did so; and took two milch cows, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:
\[11]And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.
\[12]And the cows took the straight way to the way of Beth-shemesh, [and] went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside [to] the right hand or [to] the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth-shemesh.
\[13]And [they of] Beth-shemesh [were] reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see [it].
\[14]And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where [there was] a great stone: and they cleaved the wood of the cart, and offered the cows a burnt-offering to the LORD.
\[15]And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that [was] with it, in which [were] the jewels of gold, and put [them] on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to the LORD.
\[16]And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen [it], they returned to Ekron the same day.

\[2]Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: [they were] judges in Beer-sheba.
\[3]And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
\[4]Then all the elders of Israel assembled, and came to Samuel to Ramah,
\[5]And said to him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.
\[6]But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us: and Samuel prayed to the LORD.
\[7]And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.
\[8]According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them out of Egypt even to this day, by which they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also to thee.
\[9]Now therefore hearken to their voice: yet protest solemnly to them, and show them the manner of the king that will reign over them.
\[10]And Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people that asked of him a king.
\[11]And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint [them] for himself, for his chariots, and [to be] his horsemen; and [some] will run before his chariots.
\[12]And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and [will set them] to till his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.
\[13]And he will take your daughters [to be] confectioneries, and [to be] cooks, and [to be] bakers.
\[14]And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive-yards, [even] the best [of them], and give [them] to his servants.
\[15]And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
\[16]And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your most choice young men, and your asses, and put [them] to his work.
\[17]He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye will be his servants.
\[18]And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen for yourselves; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.
\[19]Nevertheless, the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, No; but we will have a king over us;
\[20]That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
\[21]And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.
\[22]And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken to their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Go ye every man to his city.

ow there was a man of Benjamin, whose name [was] Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjaminite, a mighty man of power.
\[2]And he had a son, whose name [was] Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and [there was] not among the children of Israel a more handsome person than he: from his shoulders and upward [he was] higher than any of the people.
\[3]And the asses of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.
\[4]And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found [them] not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and [there they were] not: and he passed through the land of the Benjaminites, but they found [them] not.
\[5][And] when they had come to the land of Zuf, Saul said to his servant that [was] with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave [caring] for the asses, and be anxious for us.
\[6]And he said to him, Behold now, [there is] in this city a man of God, and [he is] an honorable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; it may be he can show us our way that we should go.
\[7]Then said Saul to his servant, But behold, [if] we go, what shall we bring to the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and [there] is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?
\[8]And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: [that] will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.
\[9](Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spoke, Come, and let us go to the seer: for [he that is] now [called] a Prophet was formerly called a Seer.)
\[10]Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go: so they went to the city where the man of God [was].
\[11][And] as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?
\[12]And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, [he is] before you: make haste now, for he came to-day to the city; for [there is] a sacrifice of the people to-day in the high place:
\[13]As soon as ye shall enter the city, ye will straightway find him, before he goeth up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he cometh, because he doth bless the sacrifice; [and] afterwards they eat that are invited. Now therefore go up: for about this time ye will find him.
\[14]And they went up into the city: [and] when they had come into the city, behold, Samuel came out meeting them, to go up to the high place.
\[15]Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,
\[16]To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him [to be] captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people from the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry has come to me.
\[17]And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, Behold the man of whom I spoke to thee! this same shall reign over my people.
\[18]Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house [is].
\[19]And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I [am] the seer: go up before me to the high place; for ye shall eat with me to-day, and to-morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that [is] in thy heart.
\[20]And as for thy asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom [is] all the desire of Israel? [Is it] not on thee, and on all thy father's house?
\[21]And Saul answered and said, [Am] not I a Benjaminite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then speakest thou so to me?
\[22]And Samuel took Saul, and his servant, and brought them into the parlor, and made them sit in the chief place among them that were invited, who [were] about thirty persons.
\[23]And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said to thee, Set it by thee.
\[24]And the cook took up the shoulder, and [that] which [was] upon it, and set [it] before Saul. And [Samuel] said, Behold that which is left! set [it] before thee, [and] eat; for to this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
\[25]And when they had come down from the high place into the city, [Samuel] communed with Saul upon the top of the house.
\[26]And they rose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Arise, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
\[27][And] as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may show thee the word of God.

hen Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured [it] upon his head, and kissed him, and said, [Is it] not because the LORD hath anointed thee [to be] captain over his inheritance?
\[2]When thou hast departed from me to-day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulcher in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
\[3]Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
\[4]And they will salute thee, and give thee two [loaves] of bread; which thou shalt receive from their hands.
\[5]After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where [is] the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou hast come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp before them; and they will prophesy:
\[6]And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.
\[7]And let it be, when these signs have come to thee, [that] thou do as occasion shall serve thee; for God [is] with thee.
\[8]And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to thee, to offer burnt-offerings, [and] to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and show thee what thou shalt do.
\[9]And it was [so], that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.
\[10]And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.
\[11]And it came to pass when all that formerly knew him saw, that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What [is] this [that] hath come to the son of Kish? [Is] Saul also among the prophets?
\[12]And one of the same place answered and said, But who [is] their father? Therefore it became a proverb, [Is] Saul also among the prophets?
\[13]And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
\[14]And Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that [they were] no where, we came to Samuel.
\[15]And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, What Samuel said to you.
\[16]And Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he told him not.
\[17]And Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpeh;
\[18]And said to the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, [and] of them that oppressed you:
\[19]And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities, and your tribulations; and ye have said to him, [No], but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.
\[20]And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
\[21]When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.
\[22]Therefore they inquired of the LORD further, if the man would yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.
\[23]And they ran and brought him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
\[24]And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that [there is] none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.
\[25]Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote [it] in a book, and laid [it] up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
\[26]And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.
\[27]But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.

hen Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.
\[2]And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this [condition] will I make [a covenant] with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it [for] a reproach upon all Israel.
\[3]And the elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days respit, that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel: and then, if [there is] no man to save us, we will come out to thee.
\[4]Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people; and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.
\[5]And behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What [aileth] the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.
\[6]And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.
\[7]And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent [them] throughout all the borders of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.
\[8]And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
\[9]And they said to the messengers that came, thus shall ye say to the men of Jabesh-gilead, To-morrow by [the time] the sun is hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and showed [it] to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
\[10]Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To-morrow we will come out to you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good to you.
\[11]And it was [so] on the morrow, that Saul disposed the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning-watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they who remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.
\[12]And the people said to Samuel, Who [is] he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.
\[13]And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to-day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.
\[14]Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
\[15]And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal: and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace-offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.

nd Samuel said to all Israel, behold, I have hearkened to your voice in all that ye said to me, and have made a king over you.
\[2]And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and gray-headed; and behold, my sons [are] with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood to this day.
\[3]Behold, here I [am]: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed; whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or from whose hand have I received [any] bribe to blind my eyes with it? and I will restore it you.
\[4]And they said thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken aught from any man's hand.
\[5]And he said to them, The LORD [is] witness against you, and his anointed [is] witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand. And they answered, [He is] witness.
\[6]And Samuel said to the people, [It is] the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt.
\[7]Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.
\[8]When Jacob had come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers from Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.
\[9]And when they forgot the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
\[10]And they cried to the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
\[11]And the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you from the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelt safe.
\[12]And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said to me, No; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God [was] your king.
\[13]Now therefore, behold the king whom ye have chosen, [and] whom ye have desired! and behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.
\[14]If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye, and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God.
\[15]But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as [it was] against your fathers.
\[16]Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.
\[17][Is it] not wheat-harvest to-day? I will call to the LORD, and he will send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness [is] great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.
\[18]So Samuel called to the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
\[19]And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for thy servants to the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added to all our sins [this] evil, to ask us a king.
\[20]And Samuel said to the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;
\[21]And turn ye not aside: for then [would ye go] after vain [things], which cannot profit nor deliver; for they [are] vain.
\[22]For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.
\[23]Moreover as for me, Far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:
\[24]Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great [things] he hath done for you.
\[25]But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye will be consumed, both ye and your king.

aul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
\[2]Saul chose him three thousand [men] of Israel; [of which] two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
\[3]And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that [was] in Geba; and the Philistines heard [of it]. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
\[4]And all Israel heard it said [that] Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and [that] Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines: and the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
\[5]And the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which [is] on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.
\[6]When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed) then the people hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
\[7]And [some of] the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he [was] yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
\[8]And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel [had appointed]: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
\[9]And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt-offering to me, and peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering.
\[10]And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
\[11]And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and [that] thou camest not within the days appointed, and [that] the Philistines assembled at Michmash;
\[12]Therefore said I, the Philistines will now come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the LORD; I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt-offering.
\[13]And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.
\[14]But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him [to be] captain over his people, because thou hast not kept [that] which the LORD commanded thee.
\[15]And Samuel arose, and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people [that were] present with him, about six hundred men.
\[16]And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people [that were] present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
\[17]And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way [that leadeth to] Ophrah, to the land of Shual:
\[18]And another company turned the way [to] Beth-horon: and another company turned [to] the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim towards the wilderness.
\[19]Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: (for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make [them] swords or spears:)
\[20]But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his colter, and his ax, and his mattock.
\[21]Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the colters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.
\[22]So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that [were] with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
\[23]And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.

ow it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of the Philistines, that [is] on the other side. But he told not his father.
\[2]And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which [is] in Migron: and the people that [were] with him [were] about six hundred men;
\[3]And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, I-chabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD'S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
\[4]And between the passages by which Jonathan sought to go over to the garrison of the Philistines, [there was] a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one [was] Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
\[5]The front of the one [was] situated northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.
\[6]And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for [there is] no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.
\[7]And his armor-bearer said to him, Do all that [is] in thy heart: turn thee; behold, I [am] with thee according to thy heart.
\[8]Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to [these] men, and we will discover ourselves to them.
\[9]If they say thus to us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.
\[10]But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand; and this [shall be] a sign to us.
\[11]And both of them discovered themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
\[12]And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.
\[13]And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armor-bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor-bearer slew after him.
\[14]And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were a half-acre of land, [which] a yoke [of oxen might plow].
\[15]And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.
\[16]And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down [one another].
\[17]Then said Saul to the people that [were] with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer [were] not [there].
\[18]And Saul said to Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
\[19]And it came to pass while Saul talked to the priest, that the noise that [was] in the host of the Philistines went on, and increased: and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw thy hand.
\[20]And Saul and all the people that [were] with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, [and there was] a very great discomfiture.
\[21]Moreover the Hebrews [that] were with the Philistines before that time, who went up with them into the camp [from the country] around, even they also [turned] to be with the Israelites that [were] with Saul and Jonathan.
\[22]Likewise all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, [when] they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
\[23]So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over to Beth-aven.
\[24]And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed [be] the man that eateth [any] food until evening, that I may be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted [any] food.
\[25]And all [they of] the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.
\[26]And when the people had come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.
\[27]But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that [was] in his hand, and dipped it in a honey-comb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
\[28]Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed [be] the man that eateth [any] food this day. And the people were faint.
\[29]Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.
\[30]How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
\[31]And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Ajalon: and the people were very faint.
\[32]And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen, and calves, and slew [them] on the ground: and the people ate [them] with the blood.
\[33]Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone to me this day.
\[34]And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay [them] here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew [them] there.
\[35]And Saul built an altar to the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built to the LORD:
\[36]And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatever seemeth good to thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither to God.
\[37]And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.
\[38]And Saul said, Draw ye near hither all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.
\[39]For [as] the LORD liveth, who saveth Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But [there was] not a man among all the people [that] answered him.
\[40]Then said he to all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what seemeth good to thee.
\[41]Therefore Saul said to the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect [lot]. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.
\[42]And Saul said, Cast [lots] between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
\[43]Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that [was] in my hand, [and], lo, I must die.
\[44]And Saul answered, God do so, and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.
\[45]And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? By no means: [as] the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.
\[46]Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
\[47]So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he harassed [them].
\[48]And he gathered a host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of them that spoiled them.
\[49]Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two daughters [were these]; the name of the first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
\[50]And the name of Saul's [wife] was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host [was] Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
\[51]And Kish [was] the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner [was] the son of Abiel.
\[52]And there was violent war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him to himself.

amuel also said to Saul, the LORD sent me to anoint thee [to be] king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou to the voice of the words of the LORD.
\[2]Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember [that] which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid [wait] for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.
\[3]Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
\[4]And Saul assembled the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
\[5]And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
\[6]And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, withdraw yourselves from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up from Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
\[7]And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah, [until] thou comest to Shur, that [is] over against Egypt.
\[8]And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
\[9]But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all [that was] good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing [that was] vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
\[10]Then came the word of the LORD to Samuel, saying,
\[11]I repent that I have set up Saul [to be] king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried to the LORD all night.
\[12]And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set him up a place, and has gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
\[13]And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said to him, Blessed [be] thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.
\[14]And Samuel said, What [meaneth] then this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
\[15]And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
\[16]Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.
\[17]And Samuel said, When thou [wast] little in thy own sight, [wast] thou not [made] the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?
\[18]And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.
\[19]Why then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?
\[20]And Saul said to Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
\[21]But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD thy God in Gilgal.
\[22]And Samuel said, Hath the LORD [as great] delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey [is] better than sacrifice, [and] to hearken than the fat of rams.
\[23]For rebellion [is as] the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness [is as] iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from [being] king.
\[24]And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words; because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
\[25]Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.
\[26]And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.
\[27]And as Samuel turned about to depart, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
\[28]And Samuel said to him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, [that is] better than thou.
\[29]And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he [is] not a man, that he should repent.
\[30]Then he said, I have sinned: [yet] honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.
\[31]So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshiped the LORD.
\[32]Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
\[33]And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.
\[34]Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
\[35]And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.

nd the LORD said to Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.
\[2]And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul shall hear [it], he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.
\[3]And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint to me [him] whom I name to thee.
\[4]And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?
\[5]And he said, Peaceably: I have come to sacrifice to the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
\[6]And it came to pass when they had come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed [is] before him.
\[7]But the LORD said to Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the hight of his stature; because I have refused him: for [the LORD seeth] not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.
\[8]Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
\[9]Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
\[10]Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.
\[11]And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all [thy] children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and bring him: for we will not sit down till he hath come hither.
\[12]And he sent, and brought him in. Now he [was] ruddy, [and] also of a beautiful countenance, and a good appearance. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this [is] he.
\[13]Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose, and went to Ramah.
\[14]But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.
\[15]And Saul's servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
\[16]Let our lord now command thy servants, [who are] before thee, to seek a man [who is] a skillful player on a harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he will play with his hand, and thou wilt be well.
\[17]And Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring [him] to me.
\[18]Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, [that is] skillful in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD [is] with him.
\[19]Wherefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send to me David thy son, who [is] with the sheep.
\[20]And Jesse took an ass [laden] with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent [them] by David his son to Saul.
\[21]And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor-bearer.
\[22]And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight.
\[23]And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took a harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.

ow the Philistines collected their armies to battle, and were assembled at Shochoh, which [belongeth] to Judah, and encamped between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
\[2]And Saul and the men of Israel were assembled and encamped by the valley of Elah, and [they] set the battle in array against the Philistines.
\[3]And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and [there was] a valley between them.
\[4]And there went out a champion from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose hight [was] six cubits and a span.
\[5]And [he had] a helmet of brass upon his head, and he [was] armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat [was] five thousand shekels of brass.
\[6]And [he had] greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.
\[7]And the staff of his spear [was] like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head [weighed] six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.
\[8]And he stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, Why have ye come out to set [your] battle in array? [am] not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.
\[9]If he shall be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I shall prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.
\[10]And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.
\[11]When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
\[12]Now David [was] the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name [was] Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men [for] an old man in the days of Saul.
\[13]And the three eldest sons of Jesse went [and] followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle [were] Eliab the first-born, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
\[14]And David [was] the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
\[15]But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Beth-lehem.
\[16]And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
\[17]And Jesse said to David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched [corn], and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;
\[18]And carry these ten cheeses to the captain of [their] thousand, and see how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.
\[19]Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, [were] in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
\[20]And David rose early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.
\[21]For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.
\[22]And David left his furniture in the hand of the keeper of the vessels, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.
\[23]And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, from the armies of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard [them].
\[24]And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were exceedingly afraid.
\[25]And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that hath come up? surely to defy Israel hath he come: and it shall be, [that] the man who shall kill him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.
\[26]And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who [is] this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
\[27]And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.
\[28]And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mayest see the battle.
\[29]And David said, What have I now done? [Is there] not a cause?
\[30]And he turned from him towards another, and spoke after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.
\[31]And when the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed [them] before Saul: and he sent for him.
\[32]And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
\[33]And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou [art but] a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
\[34]And David said to Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:
\[35]And I went after him, and smote him, and delivered [it] out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught [him] by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.
\[36]Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.
\[37]David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.
\[38]And Saul armed David with his armor, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.
\[39]And David girded his sword upon his armor, and he essayed to go; for he had not proved [it]. And David said to Saul, I cannot go with these, for I have not proved [them]. And David put them off from him.
\[40]And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling [was] in his hand; and he drew near to the Philistine.
\[41]And the Philistine advanced and drew near to David; and the man that bore the shield [went] before him.
\[42]And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.
\[43]And the Philistine said to David, [Am] I a dog, that thou comest to me with staffs? and the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
\[44]And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.
\[45]Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
\[46]This day will the LORD deliver thee into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from thee; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day to the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
\[47]And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle [is] the LORD'S, and he will give you into our hands.
\[48]And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran towards the army to meet the Philistine.
\[49]And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and hurled it with his sling, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.
\[50]So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but [there was] no sword in the hand of David.
\[51]Therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath, and slew him, and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.
\[52]And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron.
\[53]And the children of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their tents.
\[54]And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.
\[55]And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner the captain of the host, Abner, whose son [is] this youth? And Abner said, [As] thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.
\[56]And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling [is].
\[57]And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
\[58]And Saul said to him, Whose son [art] thou, [thou] young man? And David answered, I [am] the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.

nd it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
\[2]And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.
\[3]Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
\[4]And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that [was] upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
\[5]And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, [and] behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
\[6]And it came to pass as they came, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.
\[7]And the women answered [one another] as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
\[8]And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands; and [what] can he have more but the kingdom?
\[9]And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
\[10]And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and [there was] a javelin in Saul's hand.
\[11]And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall. And David escaped from his presence twice.
\[12]And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and had departed from Saul.
\[13]Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
\[14]And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD [was] with him.
\[15]Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.
\[16]But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.
\[17]And Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee for a wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD'S battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.
\[18]And David said to Saul, Who [am] I? and what [is] my life, [or] my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?
\[19]But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
\[20]And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
\[21]And Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law, in [the one of] the two.
\[22]And Saul commanded his servants, [saying], Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son-in-law.
\[23]And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you [a] light [thing] to be a king's son-in-law, seeing that I [am] a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
\[24]And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spoke David.
\[25]And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dower, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
\[26]And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law: and the days had not expired.
\[27]Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter for a wife.
\[28]And Saul saw and knew that the LORD [was] with David, and [that] Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.
\[29]And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.
\[30]Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass after they went forth, [that] David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much esteemed.

nd Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.
\[2]But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now, therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret [place], and hide thyself:
\[3]And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou [art], and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.
\[4]And Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works [have been] toward thee very good:
\[5]For he put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest [it], and didst rejoice: Why then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?
\[6]And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, [As] the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.
\[7]And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.
\[8]And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.
\[9]And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with [his] hand.
\[10]And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away from Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.
\[11]Saul also sent messengers to David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, If thou dost not save thy life to-night, to-morrow thou wilt be slain.
\[12]So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.
\[13]And Michal took an image, and laid [it] in the bed, and put a pillow of goat's [hair] for his bolster, and covered [it] with a cloth.
\[14]And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He [is] sick.
\[15]And Saul sent the messengers [again] to see David, saying, Bring him to me in the bed, that I may slay him.
\[16]And when the messengers had come in, behold, [there was] an image in the bed, with a pillow of goat's [hair] for his bolster.
\[17]And Saul said to Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away my enemy, that he has escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said to me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?
\[18]So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
\[19]And it was told to Saul, saying, Behold, David [is] at Naioth in Ramah.
\[20]And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing [as] appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
\[21]And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.
\[22]Then he went also to Ramah, and came to a great well that [is] in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where [are] Samuel and David? And [one] said, Behold, [they are] at Naioth in Ramah.
\[23]And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
\[24]And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, [Is] Saul also among the prophets?

nd David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what [is] my iniquity? and what [is] my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?
\[2]And he said to him, Far be it from thee; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing, either great or small, but that he will show it to me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it [is] not [so].
\[3]And David swore moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thy eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he should be grieved: But truly [as] the LORD liveth, and [as] thy soul liveth, [there is] but a step between me and death.
\[4]Then said Jonathan to David, Whatever thy soul desireth, I will even do [it] for thee.
\[5]And David said to Jonathan, Behold, to morrow [is] the new-moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third [day] at evening.
\[6]If thy father shall at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked [leave] of me, that he might run to Beth-lehem his city: for [there is] a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
\[7]If he shall say thus, [It is] well; thy servant will have peace: but if he shall be very wroth, [then] be sure that evil is determined by him.
\[8]Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there is in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldst thou bring me to thy father?
\[9]And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil is determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?
\[10]Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what [if] thy father shall answer thee roughly?
\[11]And Jonathan said to David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
\[12]And Jonathan said to David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to-morrow any time, [or] the third [day], and behold, [if there be] good towards David, and I then send not to thee, and show it thee;
\[13]The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it shall please my father [to do] thee evil, then I will show it to thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.
\[14]And thou shalt, not only while yet I live, show me the kindness of the LORD, that I may not die:
\[15]But [also] thou shalt not withdraw thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.
\[16]So Jonathan made [a covenant] with the house of David, [saying], Let the LORD even require [it] at the hand of David's enemies.
\[17]And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
\[18]Then Jonathan said to David, To-morrow [is] the new-moon: and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.
\[19]And [when] thou hast stayed three days, [then] thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was [in hand], and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
\[20]And I will shoot three arrows on the side [of it], as though I shot at a mark.
\[21]And behold, I will send a lad, [saying], Go, find the arrows. If I expressly say to the lad, Behold, the arrows [are] on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for [there is] peace to thee, and no hurt; [as] the LORD liveth.
\[22]But if I say thus to the young man, Behold, the arrows [are] beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.
\[23]And [as to] the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD [be] between thee and me for ever.
\[24]So David hid himself in the field: and when the new-moon had come, the king sat down to eat food.
\[25]And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, [even] upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.
\[26]Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he [is] not clean; surely he [is] not clean.
\[27]And it came to pass on the morrow, [which was] the second [day] of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why cometh not the son of Jesse to eat, neither yesterday, nor to-day?
\[28]And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked [leave] of me [to go] to Beth-lehem:
\[29]And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother he hath commanded me [to be there]: and now if I have found favor in thy eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not to the king's table.
\[30]Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious [woman], do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thy own confusion, and to the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?
\[31]For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.
\[32]And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why shall he be slain? what hath he done?
\[33]And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: by which Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to slay David.
\[34]So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
\[35]And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.
\[36]And he said to his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. [And] as the lad ran, he shot an arrow, beyond him.
\[37]And when the lad had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, [Is] not the arrow beyond thee?
\[38]And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
\[39]But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
\[40]And Jonathan gave his arms to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry [them] to the city.
\[41][And] as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of [a place] towards the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.
\[42]And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.

hen came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said to him, Why [art] thou alone, and no man with thee?
\[2]And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said to me, Let no man know any thing of the business about which I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed [my] servants to such and such a place.
\[3]Now therefore what is under thy hand? give [me] five [loaves of] bread in my hand, or what there is present.
\[4]And the priest answered David, and said, [There is] no common bread under my hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.
\[5]And David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women [have been] kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and [the bread is] in a manner common, yes, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.
\[6]So the priest gave him hallowed [bread]: for there was no bread there but the show-bread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
\[7]Now a certain man of the servants of Saul [was] there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name [was] Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of the herdmen that [belonged] to Saul.
\[8]And David said to Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand a spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.
\[9]And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it [is here] wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take [it]: for [there is] no other save that here. And David said, [There is] none like that; give it to me.
\[10]And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
\[11]And the servants of Achish said to him, [Is] not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
\[12]And David laid up these words in his heart, and was greatly afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
\[13]And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.
\[14]Then said Achish to his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: why [then] have ye brought him to me?
\[15]Have I need of mad-men, that ye have brought this [man] to play the mad-man in my presence? shall this [man] come into my house?

avid therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard [it], they went down thither to him.
\[2]And every one [that was] in distress, and every one that [was] in debt, and every one [that was] discontented, resorted to him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.
\[3]And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, [and be] with you, till I know what God will do for me.
\[4]And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.
\[5]And the prophet Gad said to David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and come into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.
\[6]When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that [were] with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants [were] standing about him;)
\[7]Then Saul said to his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjaminites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, [and] make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;
\[8]That all of you have conspired against me, and [there is] none that showeth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and [there is] none of you that is sorry for me, or showeth to me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
\[9]Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
\[10]And he inquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
\[11]Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that [were] in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.
\[12]And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I [am], my lord.
\[13]And Saul said to him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
\[14]Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who [is so] faithful among all thy servants as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honorable in thy house?
\[15]Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me. Let not the king impute [any] thing to his servant, [nor] to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.
\[16]And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.
\[17]And the king said to the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also [is] with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.
\[18]And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day eighty and five persons that wore a linen ephod.
\[19]And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
\[20]And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.
\[21]And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests.
\[22]And David said to Abiathar, I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite [was] there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned [the death] of all the persons of thy father's house.
\[23]Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou [shalt be] in safeguard.

hen they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshing-floors.
\[2]Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said to David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.
\[3]And David's men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
\[4]Then David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
\[5]So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
\[6]And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, [that] he came down [with] an ephod in his hand.
\[7]And it was told to Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.
\[8]And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
\[9]And David knew that Saul secretly plotted mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.
\[10]Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
\[11]Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.
\[12]Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver [thee] up.
\[13]Then David and his men [who were] about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah: and he forbore to go forth.
\[14]And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.
\[15]And David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life: and David [was] in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.
\[16]And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
\[17]And he said to him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou wilt be king over Israel, and I shall be next to thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.
\[18]And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.
\[19]Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which [is] on the south of Jeshimon?
\[20]Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part [shall be] to deliver him into the king's hand.
\[21]And Saul said, Blessed [be] ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.
\[22]Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know, and see his place where his haunt is, [and] who hath seen him there: for it is told to me [that] he dealeth very subtilly.
\[23]See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he is in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.
\[24]And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men [were] in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.
\[25]Saul also and his men went to seek [him]. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard [that], he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
\[26]And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men around to take them.
\[27]But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.
\[28]Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammah-lekoth.
\[29]Then David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at En-gedi.

nd it came to pass, when Saul had returned from following the Philistines, that it was told to him, saying, Behold, David [is] in the wilderness of En-gedi.
\[2]Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
\[3]And he came to the sheep-cotes by the way, where [was] a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.
\[4]And the men of David said to him, Behold the day of which the LORD said to thee, Behold, I will deliver thy enemy into thy hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good to thee. Then David arose, and privately cut off the skirt of Saul's robe.
\[5]And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
\[6]And he said to his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the LORD'S anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, seeing he [is] the anointed of the LORD.
\[7]So David restrained his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose out of the cave, and went on [his] way.
\[8]David also rose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.
\[9]And David said to Saul, Why hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?
\[10]Behold, this day thy eyes have seen how the LORD hath delivered thee to-day into my hand in the cave; and [some] bade [me] kill thee: but [my eye] spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he [is] the LORD'S anointed.
\[11]Moreover, my father, see, yes, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that [there is] neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.
\[12]The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but my hand shall not be upon thee.
\[13]As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but my hand shall not be upon thee.
\[14]After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea?
\[15]The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.
\[16]And it came to pass when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, [Is] this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
\[17]And he said to David, thou [art] more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me with good, whereas I have rewarded thee with evil.
\[18]And thou hast showed this day how thou hast dealt with me; forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thy hand, thou didst not kill me.
\[19]For if a man findeth his enemy, will he let him go away well? wherefore the LORD reward thee with good, for what thou hast done to me this day.
\[20]And now, behold, I know well that thou wilt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in thy hand.
\[21]Swear now therefore to me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.

nd Samuel died; and all the Israelites assembled, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
\[2]And [there] was a man in Maon, whose possessions [were] in Carmel; and the man [was] very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
\[3]Now the name of the man [was] Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and [she was] a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man [was] churlish and evil in his doings; and he [was] of the house of Caleb.
\[4]And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
\[5]And David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:
\[6]And thus shall ye say to him that liveth [in prosperity], Peace [be] both to thee, and peace [be] to thy house, and peace [be] to all that thou hast.
\[7]And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds who were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there aught missing to them, all the while they were in Carmel.
\[8]Ask thy young men, and they will show thee. Wherefore let the young men find favor in thy eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatever cometh to thy hand, to thy servants, and to thy son David.
\[9]And when David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal in the name of David, according to all these words, and ceased.
\[10]And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who [is] David? and who [is] the son of Jesse? there are many servants in these days that break away every man from his master.
\[11]Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give [it] to men, whom I know not whence they [are]?
\[12]So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all these sayings.
\[13]And David said to his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the goods.
\[14]But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers from the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed at them.
\[15]But the men [were] very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:
\[16]They were a wall to us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
\[17]Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do: for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he [is such] a son of Belial, that [a man] cannot speak to him.
\[18]Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched [corn], and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid [them] on asses.
\[19]And she said to her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.
\[20]And it was [so], [as] she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and behold, David and his men came down over against her; and she met them.
\[21](Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this [man] hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that [pertained] to him: and he hath requited me evil for good.
\[22]So and more also do God to the enemies of David, if I leave of all that [pertain] to him by the morning light any male person.)
\[23]And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.
\[24]And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, [upon] me [let this] iniquity [be]: and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thy audience, and hear the words of thy handmaid.
\[25]Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, [even] Nabal; for as his name [is], so [is] he; Nabal [is] his name, and folly [is] with him: but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
\[26]Now therefore, my lord, [as] the LORD liveth, and [as] thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withheld thee from coming to [shed] blood, and from avenging thyself with thy own hand, now let thy enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
\[27]And now this blessing which thy handmaid hath brought to my lord, let it even be given to the young men that follow my lord.
\[28]I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thy handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee [all] thy days.
\[29]Yet a man hath risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thy enemies, them shall he sling out, [as from] the middle of a sling.
\[30]And it will come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;
\[31]That this will be no grief to thee, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.
\[32]And David said to Abigail, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me:
\[33]And blessed [be] thy advice, and blessed [be] thou, who hast kept me this day from coming to [shed] blood, and from avenging myself with my own hand.
\[34]For in very deed, [as] the LORD God of Israel liveth, who hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light any male person.
\[35]So David received from her hand [that] which she had brought him, and said to her, Return in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.
\[36]And Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart [was] merry within him, for he [was] very drunken: Therefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
\[37]But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine had left Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became [as] a stone.
\[38]And it came to pass about ten days [after], that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.
\[39]And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed [be] the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to himself for a wife.
\[40]And when the servants of David had come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, David hath sent us to thee, to take thee to him for a wife.
\[41]And she arose, and bowed herself on [her] face to the earth, and said, Behold, [let] thy handmaid [be] a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
\[42]And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
\[43]David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.
\[44]But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, who [was] of Gallim.

nd the Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, [which is] before Jeshimon?
\[2]Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
\[3]And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which [is] before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
\[4]David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had come in very deed.
\[5]And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner, the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched around him.
\[6]Then answered David, and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
\[7]So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay about him.
\[8]Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thy enemy into thy hand this day; now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear, even to the earth at once, and I will not [smite] him the second time.
\[9]And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD'S anointed and be guiltless?
\[10]David said furthermore, [As] the LORD liveth, the LORD will smite him; or his day will come to die; or he will descend into battle and perish.
\[11]The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the LORD'S anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that [is] at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.
\[12]So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they departed, and no man saw [it], nor knew [it], neither awaked: for they [were] all asleep: because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen upon them.
\[13]Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off; a great space [being] between them:
\[14]And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who [art] thou [that] criest to the king?
\[15]And David said to Abner, [Art] not thou a [valiant] man? and who [is] like to thee in Israel? why then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came in one of the people to destroy the king thy lord.
\[16]This thing [is] not good that thou hast done. [As] the LORD liveth, [ye are] worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master the LORD'S anointed. And now see where the king's spear [is], and the cruse of water that [was] at his bolster.
\[17]And Saul knew David's voice, and said, [Is] this thy voice, my son David? and David said, [It is] my voice, my lord, O king.
\[18]And he said, Why doth my lord thus pursue his servant? for what have I done? or what evil [is] in my hand?
\[19]Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD hath stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if [they are] the children of men, cursed [be] they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.
\[20]Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel hath come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.
\[21]Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thy eyes this day: behold I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
\[22]And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and take it.
\[23]The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into [my] hand to-day, but I would not stretch forth my hand against the LORD'S anointed.
\[24]And behold, as thy life was precious this day in my eyes, so let my life be precious in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.
\[25]Then Saul said to David, Blessed [be] thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great [things], and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

\[2]And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that [were] with him to Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
\[3]And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, [even] David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess Nabal's wife.
\[4]And it was told to Saul that David had fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.
\[5]And David said to Achish, If I have now found grace in thy eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?
\[6]Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth to the kings of Judah to this day.
\[7]And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
\[8]And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those [nations were] of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.
\[9]And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.
\[10]And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to-day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.
\[11]And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring [tidings] to Gath, saying, Lest they should inform against us, saying, So did David, and so [will be] his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines.
\[12]And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.

\[3]Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
\[4]And the Philistines assembled, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul collected all Israel, and they encamped in Gilboa.
\[5]And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.
\[6]And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
\[7]Then said Saul to his servants, seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, [there is] a woman that hath a familiar spirit at En-dor.
\[8]And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine to me by the familiar spirit, and bring up for me whom I shall name to thee.
\[9]And the woman said to him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: Why then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
\[10]And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, [As] the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.
\[11]Then said the woman, whom shall I bring up to thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
\[12]And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou [art] Saul.
\[13]And the king said to her be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said to Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.
\[14]And he said to her, What is his form? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he [is] covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it [was] Samuel, and he stooped with [his] face to the ground, and bowed himself.
\[15]And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am grievously distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God hath departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known to me what I shall do.
\[16]Then said Samuel, Why then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD hath departed from thee, and hath become thy enemy?
\[17]And the LORD hath done to him, as he spoke by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbor, [even] to David:
\[18]Because thou didst not obey the voice of the LORD, nor execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing to thee this day.
\[19]Moreover, the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to-morrow [shalt] thou and thy sons [be] with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
\[20]Then Saul fell immediately all along on the earth, and was exceedingly afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
\[21]And the woman came to Saul, and saw that he was greatly troubled, and said to him, Behold, thy handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened to thy words, which thou didst speak
\[22]Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also to the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.
\[23]But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened to their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
\[24]And the woman had a fat calf in the house: and she hasted and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded [it], and baked unleavened bread of it.
\[25]And she brought [it] before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate. Then they arose and went away that night.

\[2]And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rear with Achish.
\[3]Then said the princes of the Philistines, What [do] these Hebrews [here]? And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, [Is] not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell [to me] to this day?
\[4]And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, Make this man return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he should be an adversary to us: for with what would he reconcile himself to his master? [would it] not [be] with the heads of these men?
\[5][Is] not this David, of whom they sung one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
\[6]Then Achish called David, and said to him, Surely, [as] the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host [is] good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee from the day of thy coming to me to this day: nevertheless the lords favor thee not.
\[7]Therefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.
\[8]And David said to Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant, so long as I have been with thee to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king.
\[9]And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou [art] good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding, the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
\[10]Wherefore now rise early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye shall have risen early in the morning, and have light, depart.

\[2]And had taken the women captives that [were] in it, they slew not any, either great or small, but carried [them] away, and went on their way.
\[3]So David and his men came to the city, and behold, [it was] burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.
\[4]Then David and the people that [were] with him, lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
\[5]And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
\[6]And David was greatly distressed: for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons, and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.
\[7]And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.
\[8]And David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue; for thou shalt surely overtake [them], and without fail recover [all].
\[9]So David went, he and the six hundred men that [were] with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind remained.
\[10]But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.
\[11]And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they made him drink water;
\[12]And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drank [any] water, three days and three nights.
\[13]And David said to him, To whom [belongest] thou? and whence [art] thou? And he said, I [am] a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.
\[14]We made an invasion [upon] the south of the Cherethites, and upon [the coast] which [belongeth] to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
\[15]And David said to him, Canst thou conduct me down to this company? And he said, Swear to me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will lead thee down to this company.
\[16]And when he had conducted him down, behold, [they were] spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines, and from the land of Judah.
\[17]And David smote them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels, and fled.
\[18]And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.
\[19]And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any [thing] that they had taken to them: David recovered all.
\[20]And David took all the flocks and the herds, [which] they drove before those [other] cattle, and said, This [is] David's spoil.
\[21]And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that [were] with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
\[22]Then answered all the wicked men, and [men] of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them [aught] of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead [them] away, and depart.
\[23]Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.
\[24]For who will hearken to you in this matter? but as his part [is] that goeth down to the battle, so [shall] his part [be] that tarrieth by the goods: they shall part alike.
\[25]And it was [so] from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
\[26]And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, [even] to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you, of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;
\[27]To [them] who [were] in Beth-el, and to [them] who [were] in south Ramoth, and to [them] who [were] in Jattir,

\[3]And the battle was severe against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was severely wounded by the archers.
\[4]Then said Saul to his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through with it; lest these uncircumcised should come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was exceedingly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

\[2]It came even to pass on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and [so] it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
\[3]And David said to him, From whence comest thou? And he said to him, Out of the camp of Israel have I escaped.
\[4]And David said to him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen, and are dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
\[5]And David said to the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?
\[6]And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
\[7]And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here [am] I.
\[8]And he said to me, Who [art] thou? And I answered him, I [am] an Amalekite.
\[9]He said to me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life [is] yet whole in me.
\[10]So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen: and I took the crown that [was] upon his head, and the bracelet that [was] on his arm, and have brought them hither to my lord.
\[11]Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that [were] with him:
\[12]And they mourned and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they had fallen by the sword.
\[13]And David said to the young man that told him, Whence [art] thou? And he answered, I [am] the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
\[14]And David said to him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thy hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?
\[15]And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, [and] fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
\[16]And David said to him, Thy blood [be] upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.
\[17]And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul, and over Jonathan his son:
\[18](Also he bade them teach the children of Judah [the use of] the bow: behold, [it is] written in the book of Jasher.)
\[19]The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
\[20]Tell [it] not in Gath, publish [it] not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
\[21]Ye mountains of Gilboa, [let there be] no dew, neither rain upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, [as though he had] not [been] anointed with oil.
\[22]From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
\[23]Saul and Jonathan [were] lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
\[24]Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with [other] delights, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
\[25]How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan [thou wast] slain in thy high places.
\[26]I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been to me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
\[27]How have the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

\[3]And his men that [were] with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
\[4]And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, [That] the men of Jabesh-gilead [were they] that buried Saul.
\[5]And David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, Blessed [be] ye of the LORD, that ye have shown this kindness to your lord, [even] to Saul, and have buried him.
\[6]And now the LORD show kindness and truth to you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.

\[12]And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

\[18]And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel [was as] light of foot as a wild roe.
\[19]And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
\[20]Then Abner looked behind him, and said, [Art] thou Asahel? And he answered, I [am].
\[21]And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay hold on one of the young men, and take to thee his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
\[22]And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: Why should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?
\[23]But he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth [rib], that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, [that] as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still.
\[24]Joab also, and Abishai pursued Abner: and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that [lieth] before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
\[25]And the children of Benjamin assembled themselves after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of a hill.
\[26]Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou wilt bid the people return from following their brethren?
\[27]And Joab said, [As] God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.
\[28]So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
\[29]And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.
\[30]And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had assembled all the people, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men, and Asahel.
\[31]But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, [so that] three hundred and sixty men died.
\[32]And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulcher of his father, which [was in] Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.

ow there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul became weaker and weaker.
\[2]And to David were sons born in Hebron: and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
\[3]And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
\[4]And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
\[5]And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
\[6]And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.
\[7]And Saul had a concubine, whose name [was] Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and [Ish-bosheth] said to Abner, Why hast thou gone in to my father's concubine?
\[8]Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, [Am] I a dog's head, who against Judah do show kindness this day to the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to-day with a fault concerning this woman?
\[9]So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;
\[10]To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.
\[11]And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.
\[12]And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose [is] the land? saying [also], Make thy league with me, and behold, my hand [shall be] with thee, to bring about all Israel to thee.
\[13]And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou shalt first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.
\[14]And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, Deliver to [me] my wife Michal, whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
\[15]And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from [her] husband, [even] from Phaltiel the son of Laish.
\[16]And her husband went with her, weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner to him, Go, return. And he returned.
\[17]And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past [to be] king over you:
\[18]Now then do [it]: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies.
\[19]And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.
\[20]So Abner came to David in Hebron, and twenty men with him: and David made Abner and the men that [were] with him, a feast.
\[21]And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
\[22]And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from [pursuing] a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner [was] not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
\[23]When Joab and all the host that [was] with him had come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he hath gone in peace.
\[24]Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came to thee; why [is] it [that] thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?
\[25]Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going-out and thy coming-in, and to know all that thou doest.
\[26]And when Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew [it] not.
\[27]And when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth [rib] that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
\[28]And afterward when David heard [it], he said, I and my kingdom [are] guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:
\[29]Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.
\[30]So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
\[31]And David said to Joab, and to all the people that [were] with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David [himself] followed the bier.
\[32]And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
\[33]And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?
\[34]Thy hands [were] not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, [so] fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.
\[35]And when all the people came to cause David to eat food while it was yet day, David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, If I taste bread or aught else, till the sun is down.
\[36]And all the people took notice [of it], and it pleased them: as what ever the king did pleased all the people.
\[37]For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.
\[38]And the king said to his servants, Know ye not that there hath a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
\[39]And I [am] this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah [are] too hard for me. The LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.

\[2]And Saul's son had two men [that were] captains of bands: the name of the one [was] Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (For Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin:
\[3]And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day.)
\[4]And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son [that was] lame of [his] feet: he was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name [was] Mephibosheth.
\[5]And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.
\[6]And they came thither into the midst of the house, [as though] they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth [rib]: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
\[7]For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bed-chamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went away through the plain all night.
\[8]And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul thy enemy, who sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and of his seed.
\[9]And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, [As] the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
\[10]When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, (thinking to have brought good tidings,) I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who [thought] that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:
\[11]How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
\[12]And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged [them] over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried [it] in the sepulcher of Abner in Hebron.

hen came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we [are] thy bone and thy flesh.
\[2]Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.
\[3]So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.
\[4]David [was] thirty years old when he began to reign, [and] he reigned forty years.
\[5]In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
\[6]And the king and his men went to Jerusalem to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: who spoke to David, saying, Except thou shalt take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.
\[7]Nevertheless, David took the strong hold of Zion: the same [is] the city of David.
\[8]And David said on that day, Whoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, [that are] hated by David's soul, [he shall be chief and captain]: Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
\[9]So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built around from Millo and inward.
\[10]And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts [was] with him.
\[11]And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David a house.
\[12]And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.
\[13]And David took [him] more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
\[14]And these [are] the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
\[15]Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
\[16]And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.
\[17]But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard [of it], and went down to the hold.
\[18]The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\[19]And David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said to David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
\[20]And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon my enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
\[21]And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.
\[22]And the Philistines came yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\[23]And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up: [but] fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.
\[24]And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.
\[25]And David did so as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou comest to Gazer.

\[2]And David arose, and went with all the people that [were] with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth [between] the cherubim.
\[3]And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that [was] in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio the sons of Abinadab drove the new cart.
\[4]And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which [was] at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.
\[5]And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of [instruments made of] fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.
\[6]And when they came to Nachon's threshing-floor, Uzzah put forth [his hand] to the ark of God, and took hold of it: for the oxen shook [it].
\[7]And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him there for [his] error; and there he died by the ark of God.
\[8]And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah to this day.
\[9]And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?
\[10]So David would not remove the ark of the LORD to him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
\[11]And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household.
\[12]And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that [pertaineth] to him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness.
\[13]And it was [so], that when they that bore the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.
\[14]And David danced before the LORD with all [his] might; and David [was] girded with a linen ephod.
\[15]So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
\[16]And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal, Saul's daughter, looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.
\[17]And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before the LORD.
\[18]And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.
\[19]And he dealt among all the people, [even] among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece [of flesh], and a flagon [of wine]. So all the people departed every one to his house.
\[20]Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!
\[21]And David said to Michal, [It was] before the LORD, who chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.
\[22]And I shall yet be more vile than thus, and shall be base in my own sight: and by the maid-servants which thou hast spoken of, by them shall I be had in honor.

\[4]And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying,
\[5]Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Wilt thou build me a house for me to dwell in?
\[6]Whereas I have not dwelt in [any] house since the time that I brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent, and in a tabernacle.
\[7]In all [the places] in which I have walked with all the children of Israel have I spoken a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why do ye not build me a house of cedar?
\[8]Now therefore so shalt thou say to my servant David, thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheep-cote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:
\[9]And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thy enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like to the name of the great [men] that [are] in the earth.
\[10]Moreover, I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as formerly.
\[11]And as since the time that I commanded judges [to be] over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thy enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee a house.
\[12]And when thy days shall be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
\[13]He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
\[14]I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he shall commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:
\[15]But my mercy shall not depart from him, as I took [it] from Saul, whom I put away before thee.
\[16]And thy house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.
\[17]According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.
\[18]Then king David went in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who [am] I, O Lord GOD? and what [is] my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto;
\[19]And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And [is] this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?
\[20]And what can David say more to thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.
\[21]For thy word's sake, and according to thy own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know [them].
\[22]Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for [there is] none like thee, neither [is there any] God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
\[23]And what one nation in the earth [is] like thy people, [even] like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, [from] the nations and their gods?
\[24]For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel [to be] a people to thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.
\[25]And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish [it] for ever, and do as thou hast said.
\[26]And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts [is] the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.
\[27]For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer to thee.
\[28]And now, O Lord GOD, thou [art] that God, and thy words are true, and thou hast promised this goodness to thy servant:
\[29]Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken [it]: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.

\[8]And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ish-tob, and Maacah, [were] by themselves in the field.
\[9]When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he selected of all the choice [men] of Israel, and put [them] in array against the Syrians:
\[10]And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put [them] in array against the children of Ammon.
\[11]And he said, If the Syrians shall be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon shall be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.
\[12]Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.
\[13]And Joab and the people that [were] with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.
\[14]And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
\[15]And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they assembled themselves.
\[16]And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that [were] beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer [went] before them.
\[17]And when it was told David, he assembled all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
\[18]And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew [the men of] seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.
\[19]And when all the kings [that were] servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.

nd it came to pass, after the year had expired, at the time when kings go forth [to battle], that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and destroyed Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.
\[2]And it came to pass in an evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman [was] very beautiful to look upon.
\[3]And David sent and inquired after the woman. And [one] said, [Is] not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
\[4]And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned to her house.
\[5]And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I [am] with child.
\[6]And David sent to Joab, [saying], Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.
\[7]And when Uriah had come to him, David inquired [of him] how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.
\[8]And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess [of meat] from the king.
\[9]But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
\[10]And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down to his house, David said to Uriah, Camest thou not from [thy] journey? why [then] didst thou not go down to thy house?
\[11]And Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? [as] thou livest, and [as] thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.
\[12]And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to-day also, and to-morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day and the morrow.
\[13]And when David had called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk: and at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.
\[14]And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent [it] by the hand of Uriah.
\[15]And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the front of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.
\[16]And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew that valiant men [were].
\[17]And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell [some] of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.
\[18]Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
\[19]And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war to the king,
\[20]And if the king's wrath shall rise, and he shall say to thee, Why approached ye so nigh to the city for the fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?
\[21]Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
\[22]So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.
\[23]And the messenger said to David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were upon them even to the entrance of the gate.
\[24]And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants: and [some] of the king's servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
\[25]Then David said to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.
\[26]And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.
\[27]And when the mourning was past, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.

nd the LORD sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
\[2]The rich [man] had very numerous flocks and herds:
\[3]But the poor [man] had nothing save one little ewe-lamb, which he had bought and nourished: and it grew up together with him, and with his children: it fed of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.
\[4]And there came a traveler to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the way-faring man that had come to him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that had come to him.
\[5]And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, [As] the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this [thing] shall surely die:
\[6]And he shall restore the lamb four-fold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
\[7]And Nathan said to David, Thou [art] the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee from the hand of Saul;
\[8]And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if [that had been] too little, I would moreover have given to thee such and such things.
\[9]Why hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife [to be] thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
\[10]Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.
\[11]Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thy own house, and I will take thy wives before thy eyes, and give [them] to thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
\[12]For thou didst [it] secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
\[13]And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said to David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
\[14]But, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also [that is] born to thee shall surely die.
\[15]And Nathan departed to his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and it was very sick.
\[16]David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.
\[17]And the elders of his house arose, [and went] to him, to raise him from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
\[18]And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not hearken to our voice: how will he then be grieved, if we tell him that the child is dead?
\[19]But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
\[20]Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed [himself], and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshiped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he ate.
\[21]Then said his servants to him, What thing [is] this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, [while it was] alive; but after the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.
\[22]And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted, and wept: for I said, Who can tell [whether] GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?
\[23]But now he is dead, Why should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.
\[24]And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her: and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.
\[25]And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.
\[26]And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
\[27]And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.
\[28]Now therefore collect the rest of the people, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
\[29]And David collected all the people, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
\[30]And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight of which [was] a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was [set] on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
\[31]And he brought forth the people that [were] in it, and put [them] under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus he did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

nd it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name [was] Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
\[2]And Amnon was so afflicted, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she [was] a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her.
\[3]But Amnon had a friend, whose name [was] Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab [was] a very subtil man.
\[4]And he said to him, Why [art] thou, [being] the king's son, pining from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
\[5]And Jonadab said to him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say to him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me food, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see [it], and eat [it] at her hand.
\[6]So Amnon lay down and made himself sick: and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make for me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.
\[7]Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress meat for him.
\[8]So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded [it], and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.
\[9]And she took a pan, and poured [them] out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.
\[10]And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought [them] into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
\[11]And when she had brought [them] to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.
\[12]And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.
\[13]And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.
\[14]Howbeit, he would not hearken to her voice: but being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.
\[15]Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred with which he hated her [was] greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.
\[16]And she said to him, [There is] no cause: this evil in sending me away [is] greater than the other that thou didst to me. But he would not hearken to her.
\[17]Then he called his servant that ministered to him, and said, Put now this [woman] out from me, and bolt the door after her.
\[18]And [she had] a garment of divers colors upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters [that were] virgins appareled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
\[19]And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that [was] on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.
\[20]And Absalom her brother said to her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he [is] thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
\[21]But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
\[22]And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
\[23]And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which [is] beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
\[24]And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.
\[25]And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable to thee. And he pressed him: yet he would not go, but blessed him.
\[26]Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with thee?
\[27]But Absalom pressed him that he should let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
\[28]Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have I not commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.
\[29]And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man rode upon his mule, and fled.
\[30]And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that information came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.
\[31]Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.
\[32]And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose [that] they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
\[33]Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.
\[34]But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, there came many people by the way of the hillside behind him.
\[35]And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons come; as thy servant said, so it is.
\[36]And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept exceedingly.
\[37]But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day.
\[38]So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
\[39]And [the soul of] king David longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

ow Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart [was] towards Absalom.
\[2]And Joab sent to Tekoah, and brought thence a wise woman, and said to her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:
\[3]And come to the king, and speak in this manner to him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.
\[4]And when the woman of Tekoah spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.
\[5]And the king said to her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I [am] indeed a widow woman, and my husband is dead.
\[6]And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and [there was] none to part them, but the one smote the other and slew him.
\[7]And behold, the whole family hath risen against thy handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they will quench my coal which is left, and will not leave to my husband [neither] name nor remainder upon the earth.
\[8]And the king said to the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.
\[9]And the woman of Tekoah said to the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity [be] on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne [be] guiltless.
\[10]And the king said, Whoever saith [aught] to thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
\[11]Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, [As] the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.
\[12]Then the woman said, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak [one] word to my lord the king. And he said, Say on.
\[13]And the woman said, Why then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one who is faulty, in that the king doth not bring home again his banished.
\[14]For we must needs die, and [are] as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect [any] person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.
\[15]Now therefore that I have come to speak of this thing to my lord the king, [it is] because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.
\[16]For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid from the hand of the man [that would] destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
\[17]Then thy handmaid said, The word of my lord the king, will now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so [is] my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.
\[18]Then the king answered and said to the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.
\[19]And the king said, [Is not] the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, [As] thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid:
\[20]To bring about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord [is] wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all [things] that [are] on the earth.
\[21]And the king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.
\[22]And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.
\[23]So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
\[24]And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.
\[25]But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
\[26]And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled [it]: because [the hair] was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.
\[27]And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name [was] Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.
\[28]So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.
\[29]Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, that he might send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.
\[30]Therefore he said to his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
\[31]Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom, to [his] house, and said to him, Why have thy servants set my field on fire?
\[32]And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Why am I come from Geshur? it [had been] good for me [had I been] there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there is [any] iniquity in me, let him kill me.
\[33]So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.

nd it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
\[2]And Absalom rose early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was [so], that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city [art] thou? And he said, Thy servant [is] one of the tribes of Israel.
\[3]And Absalom said to him, See, thy matters [are] good and right; but [there is] no man [deputed] by the king to hear thee.
\[4]Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!
\[5]And it was [so], that when any man came nigh [to him] to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
\[6]And in this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
\[7]And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said to the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron.
\[8]For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.
\[9]And the king said to him, Go in peace, So he arose, and went to Hebron.
\[10]But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.
\[11]And with Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem, [that were] called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.
\[12]And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, [even] from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
\[13]And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
\[14]And David said to all his servants that [were] with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not [else] escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he should overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
\[15]And the king's servants said to the king, Behold, thy servants [are ready to do] whatever my lord the king shall appoint.
\[16]And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women [who were] concubines to keep the house.
\[17]And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.
\[18]And all his servants passed on by his side; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
\[19]Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king; for thou [art] a stranger, and also an exile.
\[20]Whereas thou camest [but] yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may; return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth [be] with thee.
\[21]And Ittai answered the king, and said, [As] the LORD liveth, and [as] my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.
\[22]And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that [were] with him.
\[23]And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, towards the way of the wilderness.
\[24]And lo, Zadok also, and all the Levites [were] with him bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
\[25]And the king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and show me [both] it, and his habitation:
\[26]But if he shall thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, [here am] I, let him do to me as seemeth good to him.
\[27]The king said also to Zadok the priest, [Art not] thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
\[28]See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until word shall come from you to certify me.
\[29]Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
\[30]And David went up by the ascent of [mount] Olivet, and wept as he went, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that [were] with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went.
\[31]And [one] told David, saying, Ahithophel [is] among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
\[32]And it came to pass, that [when] David had come to the top [of the mount], where he worshiped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head;
\[33]To whom David said, If thou shalt pass on with me, then thou wilt be a burden to me:
\[34]But if thou shalt return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; [as] I [have been] thy father's servant hitherto, so [will] I now also [be] thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.
\[35]And [hast thou] not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, [that] whatever thing thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell [it] to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
\[36]Behold, [they have] there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's [son], and Jonathan Abiathar's [son]; and by them ye shall send to me every thing that ye can hear.
\[37]So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.

nd when David was a little past the top [of the hill], behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred [loaves] of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
\[2]And the king said to Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses [are] for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.
\[3]And the king said, And where [is] thy master's son? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To-day shall the house of Israel restore to me the kingdom of my father.
\[4]Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine [are] all that [pertained] to Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee [that] I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.
\[5]And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name [was] Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.
\[6]And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men [were] on his right hand and on his left.
\[7]And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:
\[8]The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and behold, thou [art taken] in thy mischief, because thou [art] a bloody man.
\[9]Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.
\[10]And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said to him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Why hast thou done so?
\[11]And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now [may this] Benjaminite [do it]? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.
\[12]It may be that the LORD will look on my affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.
\[13]And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
\[14]And the king, and all the people that [were] with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.
\[15]And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
\[16]And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, had come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.
\[17]And Absalom said to Hushai, [Is] this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?
\[18]And Hushai said to Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.
\[19]And again, whom should I serve? [should I] not [serve] in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.
\[20]Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.
\[21]And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred by thy father: then shall the hands of all that [are] with thee be strong.
\[22]So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
\[23]And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counseled in those days, [was] as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God: so [was] all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.

oreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night;
\[2]And I will come upon him while he [is] weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that [are] with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:
\[3]And I will bring back all the people to thee: the man whom thou seekest [is] as if all returned: [so] all the people shall be in peace.
\[4]And the saying, pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
\[5]Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.
\[6]And when Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do [after] his saying? if not, speak thou.
\[7]And Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given, [is] not good at this time.
\[8]For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they [are] mighty men, and they [are] chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father [is] a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
\[9]Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some [other] place: and it will come to pass, when some of them [are] overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.
\[10]And he also [that is] valiant, whose heart [is] as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father [is] a mighty man, and [they] who [are] with him [are] valiant men.
\[11]Therefore I counsel that all Israel should be generally gathered to thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that [is] by the sea for multitude; and that thou shouldst go to battle in thy own person.
\[12]So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that [are] with him there shall not be left so much as one.
\[13]Moreover, if he shall have entered into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there is not one small stone found there.
\[14]And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite [is] better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.
\[15]Then said Hushai to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counseled.
\[16]Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that [are] with him.
\[17]Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a maid servant went and told them; and they went and told king David.
\[18]Nevertheless, a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; into which they descended.
\[19]And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn upon it; and the thing was not known.
\[20]And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where [is] Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, they have gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find [them], they returned to Jerusalem.
\[21]And it came to pass, after they had departed, that they came out of the well, and went and told king David, and said to David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counseled against you.
\[22]Then David arose, and all the people that [were] with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that had not gone over Jordan.
\[23]And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled [his] ass, and arose, and went home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died. and was buried in the sepulcher of his father.
\[24]Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
\[25]And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa [was] a man's son, whose name [was] Ithra, an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
\[26]So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
\[27]And it came to pass, when David had come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
\[28]Brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched [corn], and beans, and lentils, and parched [pulse],
\[29]And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of cows, for David, and for the people that [were] with him, to eat: for they said, The people [are] hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.

nd David numbered the people that [were] with him, and set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds.
\[2]And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
\[3]But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now [thou art] worth ten thousand of us: therefore now [it is] better that thou shouldst succor us out of the city.
\[4]And the king said to them, What seemeth to you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.
\[5]And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, [Deal] gently for my sake with the young man, [even] with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
\[6]So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;
\[7]Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand [men].
\[8]For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
\[9]And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was suspended between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that [was] under him went away.
\[10]And a certain man saw [it], and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.
\[11]And Joab said to the man that told him, And behold, thou sawest [him], and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten [shekels] of silver, and a girdle.
\[12]And the man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand [shekels] of silver in my hand, [yet] would I not put forth my hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none [touch] the young man Absalom.
\[13]Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against my own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldst have set thyself against [me].
\[14]Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he [was] yet alive in the midst of the oak.
\[15]And ten young men that bore Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.
\[16]And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel: for Joab restrained the people.
\[17]And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.
\[18]Now Absalom in his life-time had taken and raised for himself a pillar, which [is] in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called to this day, Absalom's place.
\[19]Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and inform the king, how the LORD hath avenged himself of his enemies.
\[20]And Joab said to him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.
\[21]Then said Joab to Cushi, Go, tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself to Joab, and ran.
\[22]Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But however, let me also, I pray thee, run after Cushi. And Joab said, Why wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?
\[23]But however, [said he], let me run. And he said to him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outran Cushi.
\[24]And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.
\[25]And the watchman called, and told the king. And the king said, If he [is] alone [there is] tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.
\[26]And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called to the porter, and said, Behold [another] man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.
\[27]And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He [is] a good man, and cometh with good news.
\[28]And Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed [be] the LORD thy God, who hath delivered up the men that raised their hand against my lord the king.
\[29]And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and [me] thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what [it was].
\[30]And the king said [to him], Turn aside, [and] stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.
\[31]And behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.
\[32]And the king said to Cushi, [Is] the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, May the enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do [thee] hurt, be as [that] young man [is].
\[33]And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! O that I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!

nd it was told to Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.
\[2]And the victory that day was [turned] into mourning to all the people: for the people heard it said that day how the king was grieved for his son.
\[3]And the people withdrew by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
\[4]But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!
\[5]And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;
\[6]In that thou lovest thy enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.
\[7]Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably to thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou shalt not go forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse to thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now.
\[8]Then the king rose, and sat in the gate. And they told to all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.
\[9]And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us from the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us from the hand of the Philistines; and now he hath fled out of the land for Absalom.
\[10]And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?
\[11]And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, [even] to his house.
\[12]Ye [are] my brethren, ye [are] my bones and my flesh: why then are ye the last to bring back the king?
\[13]And say ye to Amasa, [Art] thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.
\[14]And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as [the heart of] one man; so that they sent [this word] to the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.
\[15]So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.
\[16]And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjaminite, who [was] of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
\[17]And [there were] a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.
\[18]And there went over a ferry-boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he came over Jordan;
\[19]And said to the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity to me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.
\[20]For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore behold, I have come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.
\[21]But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD'S anointed?
\[22]And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries to me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I [am] this day king over Israel?
\[23]Therefore the king said to Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king swore to him.
\[24]And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came [again] in peace.
\[25]And it came to pass, when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why didst thou not go with me, Mephibosheth?
\[26]And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride on it, and go to the king; because thy servant [is] lame.
\[27]And he hath slandered thy servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king [is] as an angel of God: do therefore [what is] good in thy eyes.
\[28]For all [of] my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that ate at thy own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more to the king?
\[29]And the king said to him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.
\[30]And Mephibosheth said to the king, Yes, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king hath come again in peace to his own house.
\[31]And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.
\[32]Now Barzillai was a very aged man, [even] eighty years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim: for he [was] a very great man.
\[33]And the king said to Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.
\[34]And Barzillai said to the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
\[35]I [am] this day eighty years old: [and] can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing-men and singing-women? why then should thy servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?
\[36]Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense me with such a reward?
\[37]Let thy servant, I pray thee, return again, that I may die in my own city, [and be buried] by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to thee.
\[38]And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to thee: and whatever thou shalt require of me, [that] will I do for thee.
\[39]And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king had come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place.
\[40]Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.
\[41]And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to him, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?
\[42]And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king [is] near of kin to us: why then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all at the king's [cost]? or hath he given us any gift?
\[43]And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more [right] in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.

nd there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name [was] Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.
\[2]So every man of Israel, withdrawing from David, followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah adhered to their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.
\[3]And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women [his] concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in custody, and fed them, but went not in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.
\[4]Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble to me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.
\[5]So Amasa went to assemble [the men of] Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
\[6]And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than [did] Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue him, lest he get for himself fortified cities, and escape us.
\[7]And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
\[8]When they [were] at the great stone which [is] in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded to him, and upon it a girdle [with] a sword fastened upon his loins in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell out.
\[9]And Joab said to Amasa, [Art] thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.
\[10]But Amasa took no heed to the sword that [was] in Joab's hand: so he smote him in the fifth [rib], and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
\[11]And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoreth Joab, and he that [is] for David, [let him go] after Joab.
\[12]And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.
\[13]When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
\[14]And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth-maachah, and all the Berites: and they were assembled, and went also after him.
\[15]And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that [were] with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
\[16]Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, to Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.
\[17]And when he was come near to her, the woman said, [Art] thou Joab? And he answered, I [am he]. Then she said to him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.
\[18]Then she spoke, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They will surely ask [counsel] at Abel: and so they ended [the matter].
\[19]I [am one of them that are] peaceable [and] faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?
\[20]And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.
\[21]The matter [is] not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, [even] against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
\[22]Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast [it] out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
\[23]Now Joab [was] over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada [was] over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:
\[24]And Adoram [was] over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud [was] recorder:
\[25]And Sheva [was] scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar [were] the priests:
\[26]And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.

hen there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, [It is] for Saul, and for [his] bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.
\[2]And the king called the Gibeonites, and said to them; (now the Gibeonites [were] not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn to them: and Saul sought to slay them, in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)
\[3]Wherefore David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and with what shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?
\[4]And the Gibeonites said to him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, [that] will I do for you.
\[5]And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us [that] we should be destroyed from remaining within the borders of Israel,
\[6]Let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, [whom] the LORD chose. And the king said, I will give [them].
\[7]But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the LORD'S oath that [was] between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
\[8]But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
\[9]And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill before the LORD: and they fell [all] seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first [days], in the beginning of barley harvest.
\[10]And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
\[11]And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah the concubine of Saul had done.
\[12]And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:
\[13]And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
\[14]And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son they buried in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulcher of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.
\[15]Moreover, the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David became faint.
\[16]And Ishbi-benob, who [was] of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred [shekels] of brass in weight, he being girded with a new [sword], thought to have slain David.
\[17]But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, Thou shalt go out no more with us to battle, that thou mayest not extinguish the light of Israel.
\[18]And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, who [was] of the sons of the giant.
\[19]And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Beth-lehemite, slew [the brother of] Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear [was] like a weaver's beam.
\[20]And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of [great] stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
\[21]And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.
\[22]These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

nd David spoke to the LORD the words of this song in the day [that] the LORD had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul:
\[2]And he said, The LORD [is] my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
\[3]The God of my rock; in him will I trust: [he is] my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my preserver; thou savest me from violence.
\[4]I will call on the LORD, [who is] worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies.
\[5]When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly-men made me afraid;
\[6]The sorrows of hell encompassed me; the snares of death seized me;
\[7]In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry [entered] into his ears.
\[8]Then the earth shook and trembled: the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.
\[9]There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
\[10]He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness [was] under his feet.
\[11]And he rode upon a cherub, and flew: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
\[12]And he made darkness pavilions around him, dark waters, [and] thick clouds of the skies.
\[13]Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.
\[14]The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.
\[15]And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.
\[16]And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were laid open, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
\[17]He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
\[18]He delivered me from my strong enemy, from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.
\[19]They fell upon me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my support.
\[20]He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
\[21]The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
\[22]For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
\[23]For all his judgments [were] before me: and [as for] his statutes, I did not depart from them.
\[24]I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from my iniquity.
\[25]Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye-sight.
\[26]With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful, [and] with the upright man thou wilt show thyself upright.
\[27]With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt contend.
\[28]And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thy eyes [are] upon the haughty, [that] thou mayest bring [them] down.
\[29]For thou [art] my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.
\[30]For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.
\[31][As for] God, his way [is] perfect; the word of the LORD [is] tried: he [is] a buckler to all them that trust in him.
\[32]For who [is] God, save the LORD? and who [is] a rock, save our God?
\[33]God [is] my strength [and] power: and he maketh my way perfect.
\[34]He maketh my feet like hinds' [feet]: and setteth me upon my high places.
\[35]He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms.
\[36]Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.
\[37]Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet have not slipped.
\[38]I have pursued my enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.
\[39]And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they have fallen under my feet.
\[40]For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.
\[41]Thou hast also given me the necks of my enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.
\[42]They looked, but [there was] none to save; [even] to the LORD, but he answered them not.
\[43]Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I stamped them as the mire of the street, [and] spread them abroad.
\[44]Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me [to be] head of the heathen: a people [which] I knew not shall serve me.
\[45]Strangers shall submit themselves to me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient to me.
\[46]Strangers shall fade away, and they shall tremble from their close places.
\[47]The LORD liveth; and blessed [be] my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.
\[48]It [is] God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,
\[49]And that bringeth me forth from my enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
\[50]Therefore I will give thanks to thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises to thy name.
\[51][He is] the tower of salvation for his king: and [he] showeth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.

ow these [are] the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man [who was] raised on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,
\[2]The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, and his word [was] on my tongue.
\[3]The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, He that ruleth over men [must be] just, ruling in the fear of God.
\[4]And [he shall be] as the light of the morning, [when] the sun riseth, [even] a morning without clouds; [as] the tender grass [springing] out of the earth by clear shining after rain.
\[5]Although my house [is] not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all [things], and sure: for [this is] all my salvation, and all [my] desire, although he maketh [it] not to grow.
\[6]But [the sons] of Belial [shall be] all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:
\[7]But the man [that] shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the [same] place.
\[8]These [are] the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same [was] Adino the Eznite: [he lifted up his spear] against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.
\[9]And after him [was] Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, [one] of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines [that] were there assembled to battle, and the men of Israel had gone away:
\[10]He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand adhered to the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to plunder.
\[11]And after him [was] Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were collected into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentils: and the people fled from the Philistines.
\[12]But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.
\[13]And three of the thirty chiefs went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
\[14]And David [was] then in a hold, and the garrison of the Philistines [was] then [in] Beth-lehem.
\[15]And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, which [is] by the gate!
\[16]And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that [was] by the gate, and took [it], and brought [it] to David: nevertheless he would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.
\[17]And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: [is not this] the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.
\[18]And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, [and] slew [them], and had the name among three.
\[19]Was he not most honorable of three? therefore he was their captain: yet he attained not to the [first] three.
\[20]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lion-like men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:
\[21]And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
\[22]These [things] did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among three mighty men.
\[23]He was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the [first] three. And David set him over his guard.
\[24]Asahel the brother of Joab [was] one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,
\[25]Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
\[26]Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
\[27]Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,

nd again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go number Israel and Judah.
\[2]For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, who [was] with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.
\[3]And Joab said to the king, Now the LORD thy God add to the people, how many soever they may be, a hundred-fold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see [it]: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?
\[4]Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
\[5]And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that [lieth] in the midst of the river of Gad, and towards Jazer:
\[6]Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon,
\[7]And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, [even] to Beer-sheba.
\[8]So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
\[9]And Joab presented the sum of the number of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah [were] five hundred thousand men.
\[10]And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said to the LORD, I have sinned greatly in what I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
\[11]For when David had risen in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
\[12]Go and say to David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three [things]; choose thee one of them, that I may [do it] to thee.
\[13]So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come upon thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thy enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? Now consider, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
\[14]And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies [are] great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.
\[15]So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.
\[16]And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thy hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing-place of Araunah the Jebusite.
\[17]And David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.
\[18]And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar to the LORD in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
\[19]And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.
\[20]And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming towards him: And Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.
\[21]And Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor of thee, to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
\[22]And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what [seemeth] good to him: behold, [here are] oxen for burnt-sacrifice, and threshing-instruments and [other] instruments of the oxen for wood.
\[23]All these [things] did Araunah, [as] a king, give to the king. And Araunah said to the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.
\[24]And the king said to Araunah, No; but I will surely buy [it] of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt-offerings to the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
\[25]And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. So the LORD was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

ow king David was old [and] advanced in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat.
\[2]Wherefore his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.
\[3]So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunamite, and brought her to the king.
\[4]And the damsel [was] very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.
\[5]Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
\[6]And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also [was a] very goodly [man]; and [his mother] bore him after Absalom.
\[7]And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah, helped [him].
\[8]But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who [belonged] to David, were not with Adonijah.
\[9]And Adonijah slew sheep, and oxen, and fat cattle, by the stone of Zoheleth, which [is] by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:
\[10]But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
\[11]Wherefore Nathan spoke to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth [it] not?
\[12]Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thy own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
\[13]Go, and enter in to king David, and say to him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear to thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?
\[14]Behold, while thou art yet talking there with the king, I will also come in after thee, and confirm thy words.
\[15]And Bath-sheba went to the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunamite ministered to the king.
\[16]And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What wouldst thou?
\[17]And she said to him, My lord, thou didst swear by the LORD thy God to thy handmaid, [saying], Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
\[18]And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest [it] not:
\[19]And he hath slain oxen, and fat cattle, and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
\[20]And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel [are] upon thee, that thou shouldst tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
\[21]Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.
\[22]And lo, while she was yet talking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
\[23]And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
\[24]And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
\[25]For he hath gone down this day, and hath slain oxen, and fat cattle, and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.
\[26]But me, [even] me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.
\[27]Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shown [it] to thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
\[28]Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
\[29]And the king swore, and said, [As] the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,
\[30]Even as I swore to thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.
\[31]Then Bath-sheba bowed with [her] face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
\[32]And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
\[33]The king also said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:
\[34]And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.
\[35]Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
\[36]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so [too].
\[37]As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so let him be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
\[38]So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.
\[39]And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.
\[40]And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
\[41]And Adonijah and all the guests that [were] with him heard [it] as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why [is this] noise of the city being in an uproar?
\[42]And while he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said to him, Come in; for thou [art] a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.
\[43]And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.
\[44]And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:
\[45]And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they have come from thence rejoicing, so that the city resounded. This [is] the noise that ye have heard.
\[46]And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
\[47]And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.
\[48]And also thus said the king, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel, who hath given [one] to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing [it].
\[49]And all the guests that [were] with Adonijah were afraid, and arose, and went every man his way.
\[50]And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
\[51]And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me to-day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.
\[52]And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.
\[53]So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said to him, Go to thy house.

ow the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
\[2]I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man;
\[3]And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself.
\[4]That the LORD may continue his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
\[5]Moreover, thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, [and] what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that [was] about his loins, and in his shoes that [were] on his feet.
\[6]Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoary head go down to the grave in peace.
\[7]But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.
\[8]And behold, [thou hast] with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjaminite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
\[9]Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou [art] a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do to him; but his hoary head do thou bring down to the grave with blood.
\[10]So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
\[11]And the days that David reigned over Israel [were] forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
\[12]Then Solomon was seated upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
\[13]And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? and he said, Peaceably.
\[14]He said moreover, I have somewhat to say to thee. And she said, Say on.
\[15]And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and [that] all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: but the kingdom is turned about, and hath become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.
\[16]And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said to him, Say on.
\[17]And he said, Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king, (for he will not say to thee no,) that he give me Abishag the Shunamite for a wife.
\[18]And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee to the king.
\[19]Bath-sheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.
\[20]Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; [I pray thee], deny me not. And the king said to her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not deny thee.
\[21]And she said, Let Abishag the Shunamite be given to Adonijah thy brother for a wife.
\[22]And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunamite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he [is] my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
\[23]Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life.
\[24]Now therefore, [as] the LORD liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
\[25]And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.
\[26]And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Depart to Anathoth, to thy own fields; for thou [art] worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.
\[27]So Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest to the LORD; that he might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
\[28]Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
\[29]And it was told to king Solomon that Joab had fled to the tabernacle of the LORD; and behold, [he is] by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
\[30]And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said to him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, No; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
\[31]And the king said to him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.
\[32]And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing [of it], [to wit], Abner the son of Ner captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
\[33]Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace forever from the LORD.
\[34]So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
\[35]And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the army: and Zadok the priest the king put in the room of Abiathar.
\[36]And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence to any place whatever.
\[37]For it shall be, [that] on the day thou shalt go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thy own head.
\[38]And Shimei said to the king, The saying [is] good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
\[39]And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maachah king of Gath: and they told Shimei, saying, behold, thy servants are in Gath.
\[40]And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.
\[41]And it was told to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned.
\[42]And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protest to thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest any where abroad, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst to me, The word [that] I have heard [is] good.
\[43]Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?
\[44]The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD will return thy wickedness upon thy own head;
\[45]And king Solomon [shall be] blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.
\[46]So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.

nd Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem on every side.
\[2]Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built to the name of the LORD, until those days.
\[3]And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.
\[4]And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that [was] the great high place: a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
\[5]In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
\[6]And Solomon said, Thou hast shown to thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as [it is] this day.
\[7]And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I [am but] a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.
\[8]And thy servant [is] in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
\[9]Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?
\[10]And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
\[11]And God said to him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thy enemies: but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;
\[12]Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like to thee.
\[13]And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honor: so that there shall not be any among the kings like to thee all thy days,
\[14]And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.
\[15]And Solomon awoke; and behold, [it was] a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
\[16]Then came there two women, [that were] harlots, to the king, and stood before him.
\[17]And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
\[18]And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we [were] together; [there was] no stranger with us in the house, save us two in the house.
\[19]And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
\[20]And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
\[21]And when I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I bore.
\[22]And the other woman said, No; but the living [is] my son, and the dead [is] thy son. And this said, No; but the dead [is] thy son, and the living [is] my son. Thus they spoke before the king.
\[23]Then said the king, The one saith, This [is] my son that liveth, and thy son [is] the dead; and the other saith, No; but thy son [is] the dead, and my son [is] the living.
\[24]And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
\[25]And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
\[26]Then spoke the woman whose the living child [was] to the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, [but] divide [it].
\[27]Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she [is] the mother of it.
\[28]And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God [was] in him, to do judgment.

\[2]And these [were] the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,
\[3]Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehosaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.
\[4]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada [was] over the army: and Zadok and Abiathar [were] the priests:
\[5]And Azariah the son of Nathan [was] over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan [was] principal officer, [and] the king's friend:
\[6]And Ahishar [was] over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda [was] over the tribute.
\[7]And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.
\[8]And these [are] their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:
\[9]The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan:
\[10]The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him [pertained] Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:
\[11]The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; who had Taphath the daughter of Solomon for a wife:
\[12]Baana the son of Ahilud; [to him pertained] Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which [is] by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, [even] to [the place that is] beyond Jokneam:
\[13]The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him [pertained] the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which [are] in Gilead; to him [also pertained] the region of Argob, which [is] in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and brazen bars:
\[14]Ahinadab the son of Iddo [had] Mahanaim:
\[15]Ahimaaz [was] in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon for a wife:

\[18]Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:
\[19]Geber the son of Uri [was] in the country of Gilead, [in] the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and [he was] the only officer who [was] in the land.
\[20]Judah and Israel [were] many, as the sand which [is] by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.
\[21]And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
\[22]And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of meal.
\[23]Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and roebucks, and fallow-deer, and fatted fowls.
\[24]For he had dominion over all [the region] on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side of the river: and he had peace on all sides around him.
\[25]And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.
\[26]And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
\[27]And those officers provided victuals for king Solomon, and for all that came to king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.
\[28]Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries they brought to the place where [the officers] were, every man according to his charge.
\[29]And God gave Solomon great wisdom and understanding, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that [is] on the sea-shore.
\[30]And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
\[31]For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the surrounding nations.
\[32]And he spoke three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.
\[33]And he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that [is] in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spoke also of beasts, and of fowls, and of creeping animals, and of fishes.

nd Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
\[2]And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
\[3]Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house to the name of the LORD his God, for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
\[4]But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, [so that there is] neither adversary nor evil occurrent.
\[5]And behold, I purpose to build a house to the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build a house to my name.
\[6]Now therefore command thou, that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and to thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that [there is] not among us any that is skilled in hewing timber like the Sidonians.
\[7]And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed [be] the LORD this day, who hath given to David a wise son over this great people.
\[8]And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: [and] I will perform all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
\[9]My servants shall bring [them] down from Lebanon to the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats to the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive [them]: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.
\[10]So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees [according to] all his desire.
\[11]And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat [for] food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
\[12]And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.
\[13]And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
\[14]And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, [and] two months at home. And Adoniram [was] over the levy.
\[15]And Solomon had seventy thousand that bore burdens, and eighty thousand hewers in the mountains;
\[16]Besides the chief of Solomon's officers who [were] over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who ruled over the people that wrought in the work.
\[17]And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, [and] hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.
\[18]And Solomon's builders, and Hiram's builders did hew [them], and the stone-squarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.

nd it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Zif, which [is] the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.
\[2]And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length of it [was] sixty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty [cubits], and the hight of it thirty cubits.
\[3]And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits [was] the length of it, according to the breadth of the house; [and] ten cubits [was] the breadth of it, before the house.
\[4]And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
\[5]And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, [against] the walls of the house round about, [both] of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:
\[6]The nethermost chamber [was] five cubits broad, and the middle [was] six cubits broad, and the third [was] seven cubits broad: for without [in the wall] of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that [the beams] should not be fastened in the walls of the house.
\[7]And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither; so that there was neither hammer nor ax [nor] any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
\[8]The door for the middle chamber [was] in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle [chamber], and out of the middle into the third;
\[9]So he built the house and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.
\[10]And [then] he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
\[11]And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,
\[12][Concerning] this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spoke to David thy father:
\[13]And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
\[14]So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
\[15]And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: [and] he covered [them] on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.
\[16]And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built [them] for it within, [even] for the oracle, [even] for the most holy [place].
\[17]And the house, that [is], the temple before it, was forty cubits [long].
\[18]And the cedar of the house within [was] carved with knobs and open flowers: all [was] cedar; there was no stone seen.
\[19]And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
\[20]And the oracle in the forepart [was] twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the hight of it, and he overlaid it with pure gold; and [so] covered the altar [which was of] cedar.
\[21]So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.
\[22]And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that [was] by the oracle he overlaid with gold.
\[23]And within the oracle he made two cherubim [of] olive tree, [each] ten cubits high.
\[24]And five cubits [was] the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other [were] ten cubits.
\[25]And the other cherub [was] ten cubits: both the cherubim [were] of one measure and one size.
\[26]The hight of the one cherub [was] ten cubits, and so [was it] of the other cherub.
\[27]And he set the cherubim within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the one touched the [one] wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
\[28]And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
\[29]And he carved all the walls of the house around with carved figures of cherubim, and palm trees, and open flowers, within and without.
\[30]And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
\[31]And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors [of] olive tree: the lintel [and] side-posts [were] a fifth part [of the wall].
\[32]The two doors also [were of] olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim, and palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid [them] with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm trees.
\[33]So also he made for the door of the temple posts [of] olive tree a fourth part [of the wall].
\[34]And the two doors [were of] fir tree: the two leaves of the one door [were] folding, and the two leaves of the other door [were] folding.
\[35]And he carved [thereon] cherubim, and palm trees, and open flowers; and covered [them] with gold, fitted upon the carved work.
\[36]And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams.
\[37]In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:
\[38]And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul (which [is] the eighth month) was the house finished throughout all its parts, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.

ut Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.
\[2]He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length [was] a hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and its hight thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.
\[3]And [it was] covered with cedar above upon the beams, that [lay] on forty-five pillars, fifteen [in] a row.
\[4]And [there were] windows in three rows, and light [was] against light [in] three ranks.
\[5]And all the doors and posts [were] square, with the windows: and light [was] against light [in] three ranks.
\[6]And he made a porch of pillars; its length [was] fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits: and the porch [was] before them: and the [other] pillars and the thick beams [were] before them.
\[7]Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, [even] the porch of judgment: and [it was] covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.
\[8]And his house where he dwelt [had] another court within the porch, [which] was of the like work. Solomon made also a house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had married, like to this porch.
\[9]All these [were of] costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation to the coping, and [so] on the outside towards the great court.
\[10]And the foundation [was of] costly stones, even great stones; stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
\[11]And above [were] costly stones, after the measures of hewn stones, and cedars.
\[12]And the great court around [was] with three rows of hewn stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.
\[13]And king Solomon sent and brought Hiram out of Tyre.
\[14]He [was] a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father [was] a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and ingenious to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
\[15]For he cast two pillars of brass, each of eighteen cubits high: and a line of twelve cubits did encompass each of them.
\[16]And he made two capitals [of] molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the hight of the one capital [was] five cubits, and the hight of the other capital [was] five cubits:
\[17][And] nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which [were] upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.
\[18]And he made the pillars, and two rows around upon the one net-work, to cover the capitals that [were] upon the top, with pomegranates: and so he did for the other capital.
\[19]And the capitals that [were] upon the top of the pillars [were] of lily-work in the porch, four cubits.
\[20]And the capitals upon the two pillars [had pomegranates] also above, over against the belly which [was] by the net-work: and the pomegranates [were] two hundred in rows around upon the other capital.
\[21]And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called its name Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called its name Boaz.
\[22]And upon the top of the pillars [was] lily-work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
\[23]And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: [it was] entirely round, and its hight [was] five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits encompassed it.
\[24]And under the brim of it around [there were] knobs compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea around: the knobs [were] cast in two rows, when it was cast.
\[25]It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking towards the north, and three looking towards the west, and three looking towards the south, and three looking towards the east: and the sea [was set] above upon them, and all their hinder parts [were] inward.
\[26]And it [was] a hand-breadth thick, and its brim was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.
\[27]And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits [was] the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth of it, and three cubits the hight of it.
\[28]And the work of the bases [was] in this [manner]: They had borders, and the borders [were] between the ledges:
\[29]And on the borders that [were] between the ledges [were] lions, oxen, and cherubim: and upon the ledges [there was] a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen [were] certain additions made of thin work.
\[30]And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners of it had undersetters: under the laver [were] undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.
\[31]And the mouth of it within the capital and above [was] a cubit: but the mouth of it [was] round [after] the work of the base, a cubit and a half: and also upon the mouth of it [were] gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.
\[32]And under the borders [were] four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels [were joined] to the base: and the hight of a wheel [was] a cubit and half a cubit.
\[33]And the work of the wheels [was] like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their fellies, and their spokes, [were] all molten.
\[34]And [there were] four undersetters to the four corners of one base: [and] the undersetters [were] of the very base itself.
\[35]And in the top of the base [was there] a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base its ledges and its borders [were] of the same.
\[36]For on the plates of its ledges, and on its borders, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions around.
\[37]After this [manner] he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, [and] one size.
\[38]Then he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: [and] every laver was four cubits: [and] upon every one of the ten bases one laver.
\[39]And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.
\[40]And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he executed for king Solomon for the house of the LORD:
\[41]The two pillars, and the [two] bowls of the capitals that [were] on the top of the two pillars; and the two net-works, to cover the two bowls of the capitals which [were] upon the top of the pillars;
\[42]And four hundred pomegranates for the two net-works, [even] two rows of pomegranates for one net-work, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that [were] upon the pillars;
\[43]And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;
\[44]And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
\[45]And the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: and all these vessels which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, [were of] bright brass.
\[46]In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.
\[47]And Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed], because they were very numerous: neither was the weight of the brass ascertained.
\[48]And Solomon made all the vessels that [pertained] to the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, upon which [was] the show-bread,
\[49]And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right [side], and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs [of] gold,
\[50]And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers [of] pure gold; and the hinges [of] gold, [both] for the doors of the inner house, the most holy [place], [and] for the doors of the house, [to wit], of the temple.
\[51]So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; [even] the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, he placed among the treasures of the house of the LORD.

hen Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which [is] Zion.
\[2]And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which [is] the seventh month.
\[3]And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
\[4]And they brought the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that [were] in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring.
\[5]And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled to him, [were] with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
\[6]And the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy [place], [even] under the wings of the cherubim.
\[7]For the cherubim spread forth [their] two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staffs thereof above.
\[8]And they drew out the staffs, that the ends of the staffs were seen out in the holy [place] before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are to this day.
\[9][There was] nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses deposited there at Horeb, when the LORD made [a covenant] with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
\[10]And it came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy [place], that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,
\[11]So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.
\[12]Then spoke Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
\[13]I have surely built thee a house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.
\[14]And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel were standing.
\[15]And he said, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled [it], saying,
\[16]Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel from Egypt, I have chosen no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.
\[17]And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
\[18]And the LORD said to David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house to my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart.
\[19]Nevertheless, thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house to my name.
\[20]And the LORD hath performed his word that he spoke, and I have risen in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
\[21]And I have set there a place for the ark, in which [is] the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them from the land of Egypt.
\[22]And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands towards Heaven:
\[23]And he said, LORD God of Israel, [there is] no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart.
\[24]Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: thou didst speak also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled [it] with thy hand, as [it is] this day.
\[25]Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; provided thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.
\[26]And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou didst speak to thy servant David my father.
\[27]But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have built?
\[28]Yet have thou respect to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken to the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee this day:
\[29]That thy eyes may be open towards this house night and day, [even] towards the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken to the prayer which thy servant shall make towards this place.
\[30]And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray towards this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place: and when thou hearest, forgive.
\[31]If any man shall trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thy altar in this house:
\[32]Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
\[33]When thy people Israel shall be smitten before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication to thee in this house:
\[34]Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again to the land which thou gavest to their fathers.
\[35]When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray towards this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:
\[36]Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou mayest teach them the good way in which they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
\[37]If there shall be in the land famine, if there shall be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, [or] if there shall be caterpillar; if their enemy shall besiege them in the land of their cities, whatever plague, whatever sickness [there shall be];
\[38]Whatever prayer and supplication shall be [made] by any man, [or] by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands towards this house:
\[39]Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, [even] thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)
\[40]That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest to our fathers.
\[41]Moreover, concerning a stranger, that [is] not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;
\[42](For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy out-stretched arm;) when he shall come and pray towards this house;
\[43]Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as [do] thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
\[44]If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray to the LORD towards the city which thou hast chosen, and [towards] the house that I have built for thy name:
\[45]Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
\[46]If they shall sin against thee, (for [there is] no man that sinneth not,) and thou shalt be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives to the land of the enemy, far or near;
\[47][Yet] if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent and make supplication to thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;
\[48]And [so] return to thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, who led them away captive, and pray to thee towards their land, which thou gavest to their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:
\[49]Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling-place, and maintain their cause,
\[50]And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions in which they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:
\[51]For they [are] thy people, and thy inheritance, which thou broughtest out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:
\[52]That thy eyes may be open to the supplication of thy servant, and to the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken to them in all their supplications to thee.
\[53]For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, [to be] thy inheritance, as thou didst speak by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.
\[54]And it was [so], that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees, with his hands spread up to heaven.
\[55]And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
\[56]Blessed [be] the LORD, that hath given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.
\[57]The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:
\[58]That he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.
\[59]And let these my words with which I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh to the LORD our God day and night, that he may maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:
\[60]That all the people of the earth may know, that the LORD [is] God, [and that there is] none else.
\[61]Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.
\[62]And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.
\[63]And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered to the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.
\[64]The same day did the king consecrate the middle of the court that [was] before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt-offerings, and meat-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings: because the brazen altar that [was] before the LORD [was] too little to receive the burnt-offerings, and meat-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings.
\[65]And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entrance into Hamath to the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, [even] fourteen days.
\[66]On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.

nd it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to perform,
\[2]That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.
\[3]And the LORD said to him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
\[4]And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, [and] wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:
\[5]Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.
\[6][But] if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments [and] my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:
\[7]Then will I cut off Israel from the land which I have given them; and this house which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a by-word among all people:
\[8]And at this house [which] is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus to this land, and to this house?
\[9]And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers from the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshiped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.
\[10]And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,
\[11]([Now] Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
\[12]And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.
\[13]And he said, What cities [are] these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul to this day.
\[14]And Hiram sent to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.
\[15]And this [is] the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
\[16][For] Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it [for] a present to his daughter, Solomon's wife.
\[17]And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,
\[18]And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,
\[19]And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
\[20][And] all the people [that were] left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who [were] not of the children of Israel,
\[21]Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bond-service to this day.
\[22]But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bond-men: but they [were] men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.
\[23]These [were] the chief of the officers that [were] over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people that wrought in the work.
\[24]But Pharaoh's daughter came up from the city of David to her house which [Solomon] had built for her: then he built Millo.
\[25]And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built to the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that [was] before the LORD. So he finished the house.
\[26]And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which [is] beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
\[27]And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
\[28]And they came to Ophir, and imported from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought [it] to king Solomon.

nd when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.
\[2]And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she had come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
\[3]And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not [any] thing hid from the king, which he told her not.
\[4]And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,
\[5]And the provisions of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cup-bearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
\[6]And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
\[7]Howbeit, I believed not the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen [it]: and behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.
\[8]Happy [are] thy men, happy [are] these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, [and] that hear thy wisdom.
\[9]Blessed be the LORD thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore he made thee king, to do judgment and justice.
\[10]And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices a very great quantity, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
\[11]And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.
\[12]And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug-trees, nor have they been seen to this day.
\[13]And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides [that] which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.
\[14]Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty six talents of gold,
\[15]Besides [what he had] of the merchants, and of the traffic of the spice-merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
\[16]And king Solomon made two hundred targets [of] beaten gold: six hundred [shekels] of gold went to one target.
\[17]And [he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
\[18]Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.
\[19]The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne [was] round behind: and [there were] stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.
\[20]And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
\[21]And all king Solomon's drinking vessels [were of] gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon [were of] pure gold; none [were of] silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
\[22]For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
\[23]So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
\[24]And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
\[25]And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
\[26]And Solomon collected chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\[27]And the king made silver [to be] in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars he made [to be] as the sycamore trees that [are] in the vale, for abundance.
\[28]And Solomon had horses brought from Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
\[29]And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring [them] out by their means.

ut king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, [and] Hittites;
\[2]Of the nations [concerning] which the LORD said to the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in to you: [for] surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon cleaved to these in love.
\[3]And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.
\[4]For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, [that] his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as [was] the heart of David his father.
\[5]For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
\[6]And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as [did] David his father.
\[7]Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that [is] before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.
\[8]And likewise did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.
\[9]And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,
\[10]And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.
\[11]Wherefore the LORD said to Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done by thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.
\[12]Notwithstanding, in thy days, I will not do it, for David thy father's sake: [but] I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
\[13]Yet, I will not rend away all the kingdom; [but] will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
\[14]And the LORD stirred up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he [was] of the king's seed in Edom.
\[15]For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host had gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;
\[16](For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)
\[17]That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad [being] yet a little child.
\[18]And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them from Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt; who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.
\[19]And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him for a wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
\[20]And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.
\[21]And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.
\[22]Then Pharaoh said to him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thy own country? And he answered, Nothing: yet, in any wise let me go.
\[23]And God stirred him up [another] adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, who fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:
\[24]And he gathered men to him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them [of Zobah]: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt in it, and reigned in Damascus.
\[25]And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad [did]: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
\[26]And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name [was] Zeruah, a widow woman, even he raised [his] hand against the king.
\[27]And this [was] the cause why he raised [his] hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, [and] repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.
\[28]And the man Jeroboam [was] a mighty man of valor: and Solomon, seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.
\[29]And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two [were] alone in the field:
\[30]And Ahijah caught the new garment that [was] on him, and rent it [in] twelve pieces:
\[31]And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom from the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:
\[32](But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)
\[33]Because they have forsaken me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do [that which is] right in my eyes, and [to keep] my statutes and my judgments, as [did] David his father.
\[34]Yet I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:
\[35]But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it to thee, [even] ten tribes.
\[36]And to his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for me to put my name there.
\[37]And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.
\[38]And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken to all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to thee.
\[39]And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
\[40]Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
\[41]And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, [are] they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
\[42]And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel [was] forty years.
\[43]And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.

nd Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
\[2]And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard [of it], (for he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)
\[3]That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
\[4]Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
\[5]And he said to them, Depart yet [for] three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.
\[6]And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?
\[7]And they spoke to him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant to this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.
\[8]But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that had grown up with him, [and] who stood before him:
\[9]And he said to them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?
\[10]And the young men that had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak to this people who spoke to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou [it] lighter to us; thus shalt thou say to them, My little [finger] shall be thicker than my father's loins.
\[11]And now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\[12]So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.
\[13]And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;
\[14]And spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father [also] chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\[15]Wherefore the king hearkened not to the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\[16]So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither [have we] inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thy own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents.
\[17]But [as for] the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
\[18]Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who [was] over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to enter his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
\[19]So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.
\[20]And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come again, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
\[21]And when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
\[22]But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
\[23]Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
\[24]Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.
\[25]Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt in it, and went out from thence, and built Penuel.
\[26]And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:
\[27]If this people go up to perform sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again to their lord, [even] to Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.
\[28]Upon which the king took counsel, and made two calves [of] gold, and said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt.
\[29]And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other he placed in Dan.
\[30]And this thing became a sin: for the people went [to worship] before the one, [even] to Dan.
\[31]And he made a house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.
\[32]And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that [is] in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Beth-el, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places which he had made.
\[33]So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth-el the fifteenth day of the eighth month, [even] in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast to the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.

nd behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Beth-el: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.
\[2]And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.
\[3]And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This [is] the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that [are] upon it shall be poured out.
\[4]And it came to pass when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, who had cried against the altar in Beth-el, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it to him again.
\[5]The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
\[6]And the king answered and said to the man of God, Entreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored to him again, and became as [it was] before.
\[7]And the king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.
\[8]And the man of God said to the king, If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:
\[9]For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.
\[10]So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.
\[11]Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken to the king, them they told also to their father.
\[12]And their father said to them, What way went he? for his sons had seen what way the man of God went, who came from Judah.
\[13]And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode upon it.
\[14]And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said to him, [Art] thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I [am].
\[15]Then he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
\[16]And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:
\[17]For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.
\[18]He said to him, I [am] a prophet also as thou [art]; and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water. [But] he lied to him.
\[19]So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.
\[20]And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet that brought him back:
\[21]And he cried to the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee,
\[22]But hast returned, and hast eaten bread and drank water in the place, of which [the LORD] said to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcass shall not come to the sepulcher of thy fathers.
\[23]And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drank, that he saddled for him the ass, [to wit], for the prophet whom he had brought back.
\[24]And when he had gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcass was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcass.
\[25]And behold, men passed by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcass: and they came and told [it] in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
\[26]And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard [of it], he said, It [is] the man of God, who was disobedient to the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him to the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke to him.
\[27]And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled [him].
\[28]And he went and found his carcass cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not eaten the carcass, nor torn the ass.
\[29]And the prophet took up the carcass of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.
\[30]And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they mourned over him, [saying], Alas, my brother!
\[31]And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulcher in which the man of God [is] buried; lay my bones beside his bones:
\[32]For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high places which [are] in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
\[33]After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became [one] of the priests of the high places.
\[34]And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut [it off], and to destroy [it] from the face of the earth.

t that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
\[2]And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou mayest not be known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and go to Shiloh: behold, there [is] Ahijah the prophet, who told me that [I should be] king over this people.
\[3]And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he will tell thee what shall become of the child.
\[4]And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
\[5]And the LORD said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he [is] sick: thus and thus shalt thou say to her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she will feign herself [to be] another [woman].
\[6]And it was [so], when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself [to be] another? for I [am] sent to thee [with] heavy [tidings].
\[7]Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,
\[8]And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to thee: and [yet] thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do [that] only [which was] right in my eyes;
\[9]But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:
\[10]Therefore behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam the males, [and] him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it is all gone.
\[11]Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken [it].
\[12]Arise thou therefore, depart to thy own house: [and] when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
\[13]And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found [some] good thing towards the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.
\[14]Moreover, the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.
\[15]For the LORD will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he will root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.
\[16]And he will give up Israel because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned, and who made Israel to sin.
\[17]And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: [and] when she came to the threshhold of the door, the child died;
\[18]And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.
\[19]And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they [are] written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
\[20]And the days which Jeroboam reigned [were] two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
\[21]And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam [was] forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD chose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name [was] Naamah an Ammonitess.
\[22]And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.
\[23]For they also built for themselves high places, and images and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.
\[24]And there were also sodomites in the land: [and] they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
\[25]And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, [that] Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:
\[26]And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all; and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
\[27]And king Rehoboam made in their stead brazen shields, and committed [them] to the hands of the chief of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.
\[28]And it was [so], when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.
\[29]Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[30]And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all [their] days.

ow in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.
\[2]Three years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
\[3]And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.
\[4]Nevertheless, for David's sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:
\[5]Because David did [that which was] right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any [thing] that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
\[6]And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
\[7]Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
\[8]And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
\[9]And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.
\[10]And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
\[11]And Asa did [that which was] right in the eyes of the LORD, as [did] David his father.
\[12]And he banished the sodomites from the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
\[13]And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from [being] queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt [it] by the brook Kidron.
\[14]But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.
\[15]And he brought the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.
\[16]And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
\[17]And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
\[18]Then Asa took all the silver and the gold [that were] left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
\[19][There is] a league between me and thee, [and] between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent to thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
\[20]So Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of the armies which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
\[21]And it came to pass, when Baasha heard [of it], that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
\[22]Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none [was] exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built it; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
\[23]The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
\[24]And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
\[25]And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.
\[26]And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.
\[27]And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which [belonged] to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.
\[28]Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.
\[29]And it came to pass, when he reigned, [that] he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:
\[30]Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation with which he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.

hen the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,
\[2]Forasmuch as I exalted thee from the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;
\[3]Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\[4]Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.
\[5]Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[6]So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.
\[7]And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.
\[8]In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.
\[9]And his servant Zimri, captain of half [his] chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of [his] house in Tirzah.
\[10]And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
\[11]And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, [that] he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one male, neither of his kinsman, nor of his friends.
\[12]Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke against Baasha, by Jehu the prophet,
\[13]For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.

\[15]In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people [were] encamped against Gibbethon, which [belonged] to the Philistines.
\[16]And the people [that were] encamped heard it said, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.
\[17]And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
\[18]And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died,
\[19]For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.
\[20]Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[21]Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.
\[22]But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
\[23]In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.
\[24]And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.
\[25]But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that [were] before him.
\[26]For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
\[27]Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[28]So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
\[29]And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.
\[30]And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that [were] before him.
\[31]And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him.
\[32]And he erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
\[33]And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.

\[6]And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
\[7]And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
\[8]And the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
\[9]Arise, go to Zarephath, which [belongeth] to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.
\[10]So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman [was] there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
\[11]And as she was going to bring [it], he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.
\[12]And she said, [As] the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and behold, I [am] gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
\[13]And Elijah said to her, Fear not; go [and] do as thou hast said: but make me of it a little cake first, and bring [it] to me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son.
\[14]For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day [that] the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.
\[15]And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat [many] days.
\[16][And] the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Elijah.
\[17]And it came to pass after these things [that] the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so severe, that there was no breath left in him.
\[18]And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come to me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?
\[19]And he said to her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
\[20]And he cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
\[21]And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.
\[22]And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
\[23]And Elijah took the child, and brought him down from the chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.
\[24]And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou [art] a man of God, [and] that the word of the LORD in thy mouth [is] truth.

nd it came to pass [after] many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself to Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.
\[2]And Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. And [there was] a grievous famine in Samaria.
\[3]And Ahab called Obadiah who [was] the governor of [his] house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:
\[4]For it was [so], when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
\[5]And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go into the land, to all fountains of water, and to all brooks: it may be we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.
\[6]So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
\[7]And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, [Art] thou that my lord Elijah?
\[8]And he answered him, I [am]: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah [is here].
\[9]And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab to slay me?
\[10][As] the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation nor kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, [He is] not [there]; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.
\[11]And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah [is here].
\[12]And it will come to pass, [as soon as] I have gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD will carry thee whither I know not; and [so] when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.
\[13]Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD'S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
\[14]And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah [is here]: and he will slay me.
\[15]And Elijah said, [As] the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him to-day.
\[16]So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
\[17]And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, [Art] thou he that troubleth Israel?
\[18]And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.
\[19]Now therefore send, [and] gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, who eat at Jezebel's table.
\[20]So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets to mount Carmel.
\[21]And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD [is] God, follow him: but if Baal, [then] follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
\[22]Then said Elijah to the people, I [even] I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophet's [are] four hundred and fifty men.
\[23]Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay [it] on wood, and put no fire [under]: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay [it] on wood, and put no fire [under]:
\[24]And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.
\[25]And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress [it] first; for ye [are] many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire [under].
\[26]And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed [it], and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But [there was] no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.
\[27]And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he [is] a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is on a journey, [or] perhaps he sleepeth, and must be awaked.
\[28]And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.
\[29]And it came to pass, when mid-day was past, and they prophesied until the [time] of the offering of the [evening] sacrifice, that [there was] neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
\[30]And Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD [that was] broken down.
\[31]And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:
\[32]And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
\[33]And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid [him] on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour [it] on the burnt-sacrifice, and on the wood.
\[34]And he said, Do [it] the second time. And they did [it] the second time. And he said, Do [it] the third time. And they did [it] the third time.
\[35]And the water ran around the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
\[36]And it came to pass at [the time of] the offering of the [evening] sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou [art] God in Israel, and [that] I [am] thy servant, and [that] I have done all these things at thy word.
\[37]Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou [art] the LORD God, and [that] thou hast turned their heart back again.
\[38]Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt-sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that [was] in the trench.
\[39]And when all the people saw [it], they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he [is] the God; the LORD, he [is] the God.
\[40]And Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
\[41]And Elijah said to Ahab, Go up, eat and drink; for [there is] a sound of abundance of rain.
\[42]So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,
\[43]And said to his servant, Go up now, look towards the sea. And he went up and looked, and said, [There is] nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.
\[44]And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Prepare [thy chariot], and go down, that the rain may not hinder thee.
\[45]And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.
\[46]And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

nd Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
\[2]Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do [to me], and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time.
\[3]And when he saw [that], he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which [belongeth] to Judah, and left his servant there.
\[4]But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper-tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I [am] not better than my fathers.
\[5]And as he lay and slept under a juniper-tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise [and] eat.
\[6]And he looked, and behold, [there was] a cake baked on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he ate and drank, and laid himself down again.
\[7]And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise [and] eat, because the journey [is] too great for thee.
\[8]And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.
\[9]And he came thither to a cave, and lodged there; and behold, the word of the LORD [came] to him, and he said to him, What doest thou here, Elijah?
\[10]And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, I only, am left; and they seek my life to take it away.
\[11]And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD; [but] the LORD [was] not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; [but] the LORD [was] not in the earthquake:
\[12]And after the earthquake a fire; [but] the LORD [was] not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
\[13]And it was [so], when Elijah heard [it], that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold, [there came] a voice to him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?
\[14]And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
\[15]And the LORD said to him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael [to be] king over Syria:
\[16]And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint [to be] king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint [to be] prophet in thy room.
\[17]And it shall come to pass, [that] him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.
\[18]Yet I have left to [me] seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.
\[19]So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who [was] plowing [with] twelve yoke [of oxen] before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.
\[20]And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and [then] I will follow thee. And he said to him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?
\[21]And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.

nd Ben-hadad the king of Syria collected all his army: and [there were] thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.
\[2]And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said to him, Thus saith Ben-hadad,
\[3]Thy silver and thy gold [is] mine; thy wives also and thy children, [even] the most comely, [are] mine.
\[4]And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I [am] thine, and all that I have.
\[5]And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, Although I have sent to thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver to me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;
\[6]Yet I will send my servants to thee to-morrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, [that] whatever is pleasant in thy eyes, they shall take [it] in their hand, and carry [it] away.
\[7]Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this [man] seeketh mischief: for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold, and I denied him not.
\[8]And all the elders and all the people said to him, Hearken not [to him], nor consent.
\[9]Wherefore he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first, I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.
\[10]And Ben-hadad sent to him, and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.
\[11]And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell [him], Let not him that girdeth on [his harness] boast himself as he that putteth it off.
\[12]And it came to pass, when [Ben-hadad] heard this message as he [was] drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said to his servants, Set [yourselves in array]. And they set [themselves in array] against the city.
\[13]And behold, there came a prophet to Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD.
\[14]And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, [Even] by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.
\[15]Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, [even] all the children of Israel, [being] seven thousand.
\[16]And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad [was] drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.
\[17]And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.
\[18]And he said, Whether they have come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they have come out for war, take them alive.
\[19]So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.
\[20]And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen.
\[21]And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
\[22]And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said to him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.
\[23]And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their gods [are] gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
\[24]And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:
\[25]And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, [and] surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened to their voice, and did so.
\[26]And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
\[27]And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.
\[28]And there came a man of God, and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD [is] God of the hills, but he [is] not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.
\[29]And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And [so] it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day.
\[30]But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and [there] a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men [that were] left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
\[31]And his servants said to him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel [are] merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: it may be he will save thy life.
\[32]So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and [put] ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, [Is] he yet alive? he [is] my brother.
\[33]Now the men diligently observed whether [any thing would come] from him, and did hastily catch [it]: and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
\[34]And [Ben-hadad] said to him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then [said Ahab], I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.
\[35]And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.
\[36]Then said he to him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou hast departed from me, a lion will slay thee. And as soon as he had departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.
\[37]Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded [him].
\[38]So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.
\[39]And as the king passed by, he cried to the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he shall be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
\[40]And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, So [shall] thy judgment [be]; thyself hast decided [it].
\[41]And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he [was] of the prophets.
\[42]And he said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of [thy] hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.
\[43]And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.

nd it came to pass after these things, [that] Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which [was] in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
\[2]And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it [is] near to my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; [or] if it seemeth good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.
\[3]And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to thee.
\[4]And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased, because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid himself down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.
\[5]But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?
\[6]And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it pleaseth thee, I will give thee [another] vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.
\[7]And Jezebel his wife said to him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, [and] eat bread, and let thy heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
\[8]So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed [them] with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles that [were] in his city, dwelling with Naboth.
\[9]And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:
\[10]And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And [then] carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.
\[11]And the men of his city, [even] the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, [and] as it [was] written in the letters which she had sent to them.
\[12]They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
\[13]And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, [even] against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth blasphemed God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.
\[14]Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
\[15]And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
\[16]And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
\[17]And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
\[18]Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who [is] in Samaria: behold, [he is] in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.
\[19]And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.
\[20]And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found [thee]: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.
\[21]Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab the males, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,
\[22]And will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which thou hast provoked [me] to anger, and made Israel to sin.
\[23]And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying, the dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
\[24]Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.
\[25]But there was none like Ahab, who sold himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife instigated.
\[26]And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all [things] as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
\[27]And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
\[28]And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
\[29]Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: [but] in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.

\[4]And he said to Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I [am] as thou [art], my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
\[5]And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to-day.
\[6]Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver [it] into the hand of the king.
\[7]And Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we may inquire of him?
\[8]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, [There is] yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
\[9]Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten [hither] Micaiah the son of Imlah.
\[10]And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
\[11]And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou hast consumed them.
\[12]And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD will deliver [it] into the king's hand.
\[13]And the messenger that went to call Micaiah, spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak [that which is] good.
\[14]And Micaiah said, [As] the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith to me, that will I speak.
\[15]So he came to the king. And the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD will deliver [it] into the hand of the king.
\[16]And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but [that which is] true in the name of the LORD?
\[17]And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.
\[18]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?
\[19]And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
\[20]And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said in this manner, and another said in that manner.
\[21]And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.
\[22]And the LORD said to him, With what? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets? And he said, Thou shalt persuade [him], and prevail also: go forth, and do so.
\[23]Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.
\[24]But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak to thee?
\[25]And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
\[26]And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
\[27]And say, Thus saith the king, Put this [man] in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction, and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.
\[28]And Micaiah said, If thou shalt return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.
\[29]So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
\[30]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
\[31]But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
\[32]And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it [is] the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
\[33]And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it [was] not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
\[34]And a [certain] man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
\[35]And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at evening: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.
\[36]And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the setting of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.
\[37]So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.
\[38]And [one] washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according to the word of the LORD which he spoke.
\[39]Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[40]So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
\[41]And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
\[42]Jehoshaphat [was] thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
\[43]And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing [that which was] right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; [for] the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.
\[44]And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
\[45]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[46]And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he removed from the land.
\[47][There was] then no king in Edom: a deputy [was] king.
\[48]Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.
\[49]Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
\[50]And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
\[51]Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.
\[52]And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:
\[53]For he served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.

hen Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
\[2]And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that [was] in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this disease.
\[3]But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, [Is it] not because [there is] not a God in Israel, [that] ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?
\[4]Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.
\[5]And when the messengers turned back to him, he said to them, Why have ye now returned?
\[6]And they said to him, There came up a man to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn again to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, [Is it] not because [there is] not a God in Israel, [that] thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
\[7]And he said to them, What manner of man [was he] who came up to meet you, and told you these words?
\[8]And they answered him, [He was] a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It [is] Elijah the Tishbite.
\[9]Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and behold, he sat on the top of a hill. And he spoke to him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.
\[10]And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I [am] a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
\[11]Again also he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.
\[12]And Elijah answered and said to them, If I [am] a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
\[13]And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said to him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.
\[14]Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.
\[15]And the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king.
\[16]And he said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, [is it] not because [there is] no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
\[17]So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.
\[18]Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

nd it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
\[2]And Elijah said to Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Beth-el. And Elisha said, [As] the LORD liveth, and [as] thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el.
\[3]And the sons of the prophets that [were] at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he said, Yes, I know [it]; hold ye your peace.
\[4]And Elijah said to him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, [As] the LORD liveth, and [as] thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.
\[5]And the sons of the prophets that [were] at Jericho came to Elisha, and said to him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he answered, Yes, I know [it]; hold ye your peace.
\[6]And Elijah said to him, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, [As] the LORD liveth, and [as] thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.
\[7]And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.
\[8]And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped [it] together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.
\[9]And it came to pass, when they had gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
\[10]And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: [nevertheless], if thou shalt see me [when I am] taken from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not, it shall not be [so].
\[11]And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that behold, [there appeared] a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
\[12]And Elisha saw [it], and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.
\[13]He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;
\[14]And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where [is] the LORD God of Elijah? And when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.
\[15]And when the sons of the prophets who [were] to view at Jericho, saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
\[16]And they said to him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest perhaps the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.
\[17]And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.
\[18]And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?
\[19]And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city [is] pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water [is] bad, and the ground barren.
\[20]And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought [it] to him.
\[21]And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren [land].
\[22]So the waters were healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.
\[23]And he went up from thence to Beth-el: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, thou bald-head; go up, thou bald-head.
\[24]And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tore forty and two children of them.
\[25]And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.

ow Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria [in] the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
\[2]And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.
\[3]Nevertheless, he cleaved to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
\[4]And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master, and rendered to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams, with the wool.
\[5]But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
\[6]And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.
\[7]And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go: I [am] as thou [art], my people as thy people, [and] my horses as thy horses.
\[8]And he said, which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.
\[9]So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that followed them.
\[10]And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!
\[11]But Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here [is] Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.
\[12]And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
\[13]And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him, No: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
\[14]And Elisha said, [As] the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look towards thee, nor see thee.
\[15]But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.
\[16]And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.
\[17]For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.
\[18]And this is [but] a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.
\[19]And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.
\[20]And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat-offering was offered, that behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
\[21]And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood in the border.
\[22]And they rose early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side [as] red as blood:
\[23]And they said, This [is] blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.
\[24]And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in [their] country.
\[25]And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirhara-seth they left the stones of it; but the slingers went about [it], and smote it.
\[26]And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom: but they could not.
\[27]Then he took his eldest son that was to reign in his stead, and offered him [for] a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: And they departed from him, and returned to [their own] land.

ow there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant feared the LORD: and the creditor hath come to take to him my two sons to be bond-men.
\[2]And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.
\[3]Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, [even] empty vessels; borrow not a few.
\[4]And when thou hast come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.
\[5]So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought [the vessels] to her; and she poured out.
\[6]And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to her, [There is] not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.
\[7]Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children on the remainder.
\[8]And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where [was] a distinguished woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And [so] it was, [that] as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.
\[9]And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this [is] a holy man of God, who passeth by us continually.
\[10]Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.
\[11]And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.
\[12]And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunamite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.
\[13]And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what [is] to be done for thee? wouldst thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.
\[14]And he said, What then [is] to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.
\[15]And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.
\[16]And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, [thou] man of God, do not lie to thy handmaid.
\[17]And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season that Elisha had said to her, according to the time of life.
\[18]And when the child was grown, it happened on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.
\[19]And he said to his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.
\[20]And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and [then] died.
\[21]And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut [the door] upon him, and went out.
\[22]And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.
\[23]And he said, Why wilt thou go to him to-day? [it is] neither new-moon, nor sabbath. And she said, [It shall be] well.
\[24]Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not [thy] riding for me, except I bid thee.
\[25]So she went and came to the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, [yonder is] that Shunamite:
\[26]Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say to her, [Is it] well with thee? [Is it] well with thy husband? [Is it] well with the child? and she answered, [It is] well.
\[27]And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul [is] sorrowful within her: and the LORD hath hid [it] from me, and hath not told me?
\[28]Then she said, Did I ask a son from my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me.
\[29]Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way: and if thou shalt meet any man, salute him not; and if any shall salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.
\[30]And the mother of the child said, [As] the LORD liveth, and [as] thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.
\[31]And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but [there was] neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.
\[32]And when Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, [and] laid upon his bed.
\[33]He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them both, and prayed to the LORD.
\[34]And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child became warm.
\[35]Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
\[36]And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunamite. So he called her. And when she had come in to him, he said, Take up thy son.
\[37]Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.
\[38]And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And [there was] a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets [were] sitting before him: and he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.
\[39]And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred [them] into the pot of pottage: for they knew [them] not.
\[40]So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O [thou] man of God, [there is] death in the pot. And they could not eat [of it].
\[41]But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast [it] into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.
\[42]And there came a man from Baal-shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in its husk. And he said, Give to the people, that they may eat.
\[43]And his servitor said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave [of it].
\[44]So he set [it] before them, and they ate, and left [of it], according to the word of the LORD.

ow Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance to Syria: he was also a mighty man in valor, [but he was] a leper.
\[2]And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.
\[3]And she said to her mistress, I would that my lord [were] with the prophet that [is] in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.
\[4]And [one] went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that [is] of the land of Israel.
\[5]And the king of Syria said, Come, go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand [pieces] of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
\[6]And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter hath come to thee, behold, I have [with this] sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.
\[7]And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, [Am] I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send to me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.
\[8]And it was [so], when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
\[9]So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
\[10]And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.
\[11]But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.
\[12][Are] not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.
\[13]And his servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father, [if] the prophet had bid thee [do some] great thing, wouldst thou not have done [it]? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?
\[14]Then he went down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
\[15]And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that [there is] no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing from thy servant.
\[16]But he said, [As] the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take [it]; but he refused.
\[17]And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD.
\[18]In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, [that] when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.
\[19]And he said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.
\[20]But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but [as] the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat from him.
\[21]So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw [him] running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, [Is] all well?
\[22]And he said, All [is] well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there have come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.
\[23]And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid [them] upon two of his servants; and they bore [them] before him.
\[24]And when he came to the tower, he took [them] from their hand, and bestowed [them] in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.
\[25]But he went in, and stood before his master: and Elisha said to him, Whence [comest thou] Gehazi? and he said, Thy servant went no whither.
\[26]And he said to him, Went not my heart [with thee], when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? [Is it] a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive-yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and maid-servants?
\[27]The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave to thee, and to thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow.

nd the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too narrow for us.
\[2]Let us go, we pray thee, to Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.
\[3]And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.
\[4]So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.
\[5]But as one was felling a beam, the ax head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.
\[6]And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast [it] in thither; and the iron floated.
\[7]Therefore said he, Take [it] up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it.
\[8]Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place [shall be] my camp.
\[9]And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians have come down.
\[10]And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.
\[11]Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said to them, Will ye not show me which of us [is] for the king of Israel?
\[12]And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that [is] in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed-chamber.
\[13]And he said, Go, and spy where he [is], that I may send and bring him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, [he is] in Dothan.
\[14]Therefore he sent thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and encompassed the city.
\[15]And when the servant of the man of God had risen early, and gone forth, behold, a host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?
\[16]And he answered, Fear not: for they that [are] with us [are] more than they that [are] with them.
\[17]And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and behold, the mountain [was] full of horses and chariots of fire around Elisha.
\[18]And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
\[19]And Elisha said to them, This [is] not the way, neither [is] this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.
\[20]And it came to pass, when they had come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these [men], that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, [they were] in the midst of Samaria.
\[21]And the king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite [them]? shall I smite [them]?
\[22]And he answered, Thou shalt not smite [them]: wouldst thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.
\[23]And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drank, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
\[24]And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
\[25]And there was a great famine in Samaria: and behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was [sold] for eighty [pieces] of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five [pieces] of silver.
\[26]And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.
\[27]And he said, If the LORD doth not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barn-floor, or out of the wine-press?
\[28]And the king said to her, What aileth thee? and she answered, This woman said to me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow.
\[29]So we boiled my son, and ate him: and I said to her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.
\[30]And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and behold, [he had] sackcloth within upon his flesh.
\[31]Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.
\[32]But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and [the king] sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: [is] not the sound of his master's feet behind him?
\[33]And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down to him: and he said, Behold, this evil [is] from the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?

\[2]Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, [if] the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see [it] with thy eyes, but shalt not eat of it.
\[3]And there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?
\[4]If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine [is] in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall to the army of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.
\[5]And they rose in the twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians: and when they had come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, [there was] no man there.
\[6]For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, [even] the noise of a great army: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.
\[7]Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it [was], and fled for their life.
\[8]And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drank, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid [it]; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence [also], and went and hid [it].
\[9]Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day [is] a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.
\[10]So they came and called to the porter of the city: and they told him, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and behold, [there was] no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they [were].
\[11]And he called the porters; and they told [it] to the king's house within.
\[12]And the king arose in the night, and said to his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we [are] hungry; therefore they have gone out of the camp, to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.
\[13]And one of his servants answered and said, Let [some] take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they [are] as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, [I say], they [are] even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.
\[14]They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.
\[15]And they went after them to Jordan: and lo, all the way [was] full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.
\[16]And the people went out, and plundered the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was [sold] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.
\[17]And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.
\[18]And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to-morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:
\[19]And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, [if] the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thy eyes, but shalt not eat of it.
\[20]And so it happened to him: for the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died.

hen Elisha spoke to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thy household, and sojourn wherever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.
\[2]And the woman arose, and did according to the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
\[3]And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry to the king for her house, and for her land.
\[4]And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.
\[5]And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this [is] the woman, and this [is] her son, whom Elisha restored to life.
\[6]And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that [was] hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even till now.
\[7]And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told to him, saying, The man of God hath come hither.
\[8]And the king said to Hazael, Take a present in thy hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
\[9]So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
\[10]And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, Thou mayest certainly recover: but the LORD hath showed me, that he shall surely die.
\[11]And he settled his countenance steadfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.
\[12]And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do to the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.
\[13]And Hazael said, But what, [is] thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shown me that thou [wilt be] king over Syria.
\[14]So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me [that] thou shouldest surely recover.
\[15]And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped [it] in water, and spread [it] on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.
\[16]And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat [being] then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.
\[17]Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
\[18]And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.
\[19]Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah, for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him always a light, [and] to his children.
\[20]In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
\[21]So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites who encompassed him, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.
\[22]Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
\[23]And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[24]And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers, in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
\[25]In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.
\[26]Two and twenty years old [was] Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
\[27]And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as [did] the house of Ahab: for he [was] the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.
\[28]And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
\[29]And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.

nd Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead:
\[2]And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;
\[3]Then take the box of oil, and pour [it] on his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.
\[4]So the young man, [even] the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.
\[5]And when he came, behold, the captains of the host [were] sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, To which of us all? And he said, To thee, O captain.
\[6]And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, [even] over Israel.
\[7]And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.
\[8]For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab the males, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:
\[9]And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:
\[10]And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and [there shall be] none to bury [her]. And he opened the door, and fled.
\[11]Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and [one] said to him, [Is] all well? Why came this mad [man] to thee? And he said to them, Ye know the man, and his communication.
\[12]And they said, [It is] false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus he spoke to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.
\[13]Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put [it] under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.
\[14]So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.
\[15]But king Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it is your minds, [then] let none go forth [nor] escape from the city to go to tell [it] in Jezreel.
\[16]So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.
\[17]And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, [Is it] peace?
\[18]So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, [Is it] peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he doth not return.
\[19]Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, [Is it] peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.
\[20]And the watchman told, saying, He came even to them, and doth not return? and the driving [is] like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.
\[21]And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
\[22]And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, [Is it] peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the lewd acts of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts [are so] many?
\[23]And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, [There is] treachery, O Ahaziah.
\[24]And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.
\[25]Then said [Jehu] to Bidkar his captain, Take up, [and] cast him into the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;
\[26]Surely I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take [and] cast him into the plat [of ground], according to the word of the LORD.
\[27]But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw [this], he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. [And they did so] at the going up to Gur, which [is] by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.
\[28]And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulcher with his fathers in the city of David.
\[29]And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.
\[30]And when Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard [of it]; and she painted her face, and adorned her head, and looked out at a window.
\[31]And as Jehu entered the gate, she said, [Had] Zimri peace, who slew his master?
\[32]And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who [is] on my side? who? And there looked out to him two [or] three eunuchs.
\[33]And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and [some] of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trod her under foot.
\[34]And when he had come in, he ate, and drank, and said, Go, see now this cursed [woman], and bury her: for she [is] a king's daughter.
\[35]And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of [her] hands.
\[36]Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This [is] the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:
\[37]And the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; [so] that they shall not say, This [is] Jezebel.

nd Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's [children], saying,
\[2]Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons [are] with you, and [there are] with you chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor;
\[3]Look out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set [him] on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.
\[4]But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?
\[5]And he that [was] over the house, and he that [was] over the city, the elders also, and those who brought up [the children], sent to Jehu, saying, We [are] thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou [that which is] good in thy eyes.
\[6]Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, if ye [are] mine, and [if] ye will hearken to my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to-morrow this time. Now the king's sons [being] seventy persons, [were] with the great men of the city, who brought them up.
\[7]And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent [them] to him to Jezreel.
\[8]And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.
\[9]And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye [are] righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?
\[10]Know now that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab; for the LORD hath done [that] which he spoke by his servant Elijah.
\[11]So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsmen, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.
\[12]And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. [And] as he [was] at the shearing-house in the way,
\[13]Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who [are] ye? And they answered, We [are] the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.
\[14]And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing-house, [even] two and forty men; neither left he any of them.
\[15]And when he had departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab [coming] to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thy heart right, as my heart [is] with thy heart; And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it is, give [me] thy hand. And he gave [him] his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.
\[16]And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot.
\[17]And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke to Elijah.
\[18]And Jehu convened all the people, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little; [but] Jehu shall serve him much.
\[19]Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice [to do] to Baal: whoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did [it] in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshipers of Baal.
\[20]And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed [it].
\[21]And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.
\[22]And he said to him that [was] over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshipers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.
\[23]And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said to the worshipers of Baal, Search, and look that there are here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshipers of Baal only.
\[24]And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings, Jehu appointed eighty men without, and said, [If] any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, [he that letteth him go], his life [shall be] for the life of him.
\[25]And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, [and] slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast [them] out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.
\[26]And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.
\[27]And they broke down the image of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a draught-house to this day.
\[28]Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
\[29]Yet [from] the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, [to wit], the golden calves that [were] in Beth-el, and that [were] in Dan.
\[30]And the LORD said to Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing [that which is] right in my eyes, [and] hast done to the house of Ahab according to all that [was] in my heart, thy children of the fourth [generation] shall sit on the throne of Israel.
\[31]But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin.
\[32]In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the borders of Israel;
\[33]From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which [is] by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
\[34]Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[35]And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.

\[2]But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons [who were] slain; and they hid him, [even] him and his nurse, in the bed-chamber, from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.
\[3]And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land.
\[4]And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and took the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king's son.
\[5]And he commanded them, saying, This [is] the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;
\[6]And a third part [shall be] at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.
\[7]And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.
\[8]And ye shall compass the king around, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain. And be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.
\[9]And the captains over the hundreds did according to all [things] that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.
\[10]And to the captains over hundreds the priest gave king David's spears and shields, that [were] in the temple of the LORD.
\[11]And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, around the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, [along] by the altar and the temple.
\[12]And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and [gave him] the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.
\[13]And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard [and] of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.
\[14]And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner [was], and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets. And Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, treason.
\[15]But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said to them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.
\[16]And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.
\[17]And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD'S people; between the king also and the people.
\[18]And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and broke it down; his altars and his images they broke wholly in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the the house of the LORD.
\[19]And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.

\[2]And Jehoash did [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
\[3]But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
\[4]And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, [even] the money of every one that passeth [the account], the money that every man is set at, [and] all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,
\[5]Let the priests take [it] to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, wherever any breach shall be found.
\[6]But it was [so], [that] in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
\[7]Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the [other] priests, and said to them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no [more] money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.
\[8]And the priests consented to receive no [more] money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.
\[9]But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put in it all the money [that was] brought into the house of the LORD.
\[10]And it was [so], when they saw that [there was] much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and counted the money [that was] found in the house of the LORD.
\[11]And they gave the money, being counted, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD,
\[12]And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair [it].
\[13]Yet, there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money [that was] brought into the house of the LORD:
\[14]But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired with it the house of the LORD.
\[15]Moreover, they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.
\[16]The trespass-money and sin-money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests'.

\[18]And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold [that was] found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent [it] to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.

\[3]And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, all [their] days.
\[4]And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened to him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.
\[5](And the LORD gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as formerly.
\[6]Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, [but] walked in them: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.)
\[7]Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.
\[8]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

\[14]Now Elisha had fallen sick of his disease of which he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.
\[15]And Elisha said to him, Take bow and arrows. And he took to him bow and arrows.
\[16]And he said to the king of Israel, Put thy hand upon the bow. And he put his hand [upon it]: and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands.
\[17]And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened [it]. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD'S deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou hast consumed [them].
\[18]And he said, Take the arrows. And he took [them]. And he said to the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and ceased.
\[19]And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldst have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed [it]: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria [but] thrice.
\[20]And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
\[21]And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that behold, they spied a band [of men]; and they cast the man into the sepulcher of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood on his feet.
\[22]But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
\[23]And the LORD was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither did he as yet reject them from his presence.

\[4]But, the high places were not taken away: as yet the people sacrificed, and burnt incense on the high places.
\[5]And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father.
\[6]But the children of the murderers he slew not: according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, in which the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
\[7]He slew of Edom in the valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day.

\[10]Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thy heart hath lifted thee up: glory [of this], and tarry at home: for why shouldst thou meddle to [thy] hurt, that thou shouldst fall, [even] thou, and Judah with thee?
\[11]But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up: and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which [belongeth] to Judah.

\[6]In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor [by] the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
\[7]For [so] it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
\[8]And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel which they had made.
\[9]And the children of Israel did secretly things that [were] not right against the LORD their God, and they built for themselves high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.
\[10]And they set up for themselves images and groves on every high hill, and under every green tree:
\[11]And there they burnt incense on all the high places, as [did] the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:
\[12]For they served idols, of which the LORD had said to them, Ye shall not do this thing.
\[13]Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, [and by] all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments [and] my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.
\[14]Notwithstanding, they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.
\[15]And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that [were] around them, [concerning] whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them.
\[16]And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made for themselves molten images, [even] two calves, and made a grove, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
\[17]And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
\[18]Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
\[19]Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.
\[20]And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.
\[21]For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.
\[22]For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;
\[23]Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.
\[24]And the king of Assyria brought [men] from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed [them] in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in its cities.
\[25]And [so] it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, [that] they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew [some] of them.
\[26]Wherefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.
\[27]Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.
\[28]Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.
\[29]Yet, every nation made gods of their own, and put [them] in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they dwelt.
\[30]And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
\[31]And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
\[32]So they feared the LORD, and made to themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.
\[33]They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.
\[34]To this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;
\[35]With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:
\[36]But the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and an out-stretched arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.
\[37]And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.
\[38]And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.
\[39]But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
\[40]Yet they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.
\[41]So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they to this day.

ow it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, [that] Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
\[2]Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also [was] Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
\[3]And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.
\[4]He removed the high places, and broke the images, and cut down the groves, and broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made: for till those days the children of Israel burnt incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.
\[5]He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor [any] that were before him.
\[6]For he cleaved to the LORD, [and] departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.
\[7]And the LORD was with him; [and] he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.
\[8]He smote the Philistines, [even] to Gaza, and its borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.
\[9]And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which [was] the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, [that] Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
\[10]And at the end of three years they took it: [even] in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that [is] the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
\[11]And the king of Assyria carried away Israel to Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor [by] the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:
\[12]Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, [and] all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear [them], nor do [them].
\[13]Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
\[14]And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me I will bear. And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
\[15]And Hezekiah gave [him] all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.
\[16]At that time did Hezekiah cut off [the gold from] the doors of the temple of the LORD, and [from] the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
\[17]And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rab-shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army against Jerusalem: and they went up, and came to Jerusalem: and when they had come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which [is] in the highway of the fuller's field.
\[18]And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who [was] over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
\[19]And Rab-shakeh said to them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence [is] this in which thou trustest?
\[20]Thou sayest, but [they are but] vain words, I [have] counsel and strength for the war. Now in whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
\[21]Now behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, [even] upon Egypt, on which if a man leaneth, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so [is] Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him.
\[22]But if ye say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: [is] not that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
\[23]Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou shalt be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
\[24]How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
\[25]Have I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
\[26]Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna and Joah, to Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand [it]: and talk not with us in the Jews language in the ears of the people that [are] on the wall.
\[27]But Rab-shakeh said to them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? [hath he] not [sent me] to the men who sit on the wall, that they may feed on their vilest excretions with you?
\[28]Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews language, and spoke, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:
\[29]Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:
\[30]Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[31]Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make [an agreement] with me by a present, and come out to me, and [then] eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern:
\[32]Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive-oil and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not to Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.
\[33]Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\[34]Where [are] the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where [are] the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
\[35]Who [are] they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
\[36]But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
\[37]Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who [was] over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with [their] clothes rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh.

nd it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard [it], that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
\[2]And he sent Eliakim, who [was] over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
\[3]And they said to him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day [is] a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children have come to the birth, and [there is] not strength to bring forth.
\[4]It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up [thy] prayer for the remnant that are left.
\[5]So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
\[6]And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
\[7]Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumor, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
\[8]So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.
\[9]And when he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Cush, Behold, he hath come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,
\[10]Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[11]Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?
\[12]Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; [as] Gozan and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden who [were] in Thelasar?
\[13]Where [is] the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?
\[14]And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
\[15]And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, who dwellest [between] the cherubim, thou art the God, [even] thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.
\[16]LORD, bow down thy ear, and hear: open, LORD, thy eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent him to reproach the living God.
\[17]Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,
\[18]And have cast their gods into the fire: for they [were] no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
\[19]Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou [art] the LORD God, [even] thou only.
\[20]Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, [That] which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.
\[21]This [is] the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, [and] laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
\[22]Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted [thy] voice, and lifted up thy eyes on high: [even] against the Holy [One] of Israel.
\[23]By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the hight of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down its tall cedar trees, [and] its choice fir trees: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, [and into] the forest of his Carmel.
\[24]I have digged and drank strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.
\[25]Hast thou not heard long ago [how] I have done it, [and] of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldst be to lay waste fortified cities [in] ruinous heaps.
\[26]Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were [as] the grass of the field, and [as] the green herb, [as] the grass on the house-tops, and [as corn] blasted before it is grown up.
\[27]But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
\[28]Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
\[29]And this [shall be] a sign to thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits of it.
\[30]And the remnant that hath escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
\[31]For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape from mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD [of hosts] shall do this.
\[32]Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.
\[33]By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.
\[34]For I will defend this city, to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\[35]And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they [were] all dead corpses.
\[36]So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
\[37]And it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.

n those days was Hezekiah sick to death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.
\[2]Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the LORD, saying,
\[3]I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done [that which is] good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept grievously.
\[4]And it came to pass, before Isaiah had gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
\[5]Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up to the house of the LORD.
\[6]And I will add to thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\[7]And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid [it] on the boil, and he recovered.
\[8]And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What [shall be] the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?
\[9]And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?
\[10]And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten degrees: no, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.
\[11]And Isaiah the prophet cried to the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz.
\[12]At that time Berodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
\[13]And Hezekiah hearkened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and [all] the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.
\[14]Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from whence came they to thee? And Hezekiah said, They have come from a far country [even] from Babylon.
\[15]And he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All [the things] that [are] in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.
\[16]And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.
\[17]Behold, the days come, that all that [is] in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store to this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.
\[18]And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
\[19]Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good [is] the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. And he said, [Is it] not [good], if peace and truth shall be in my days?
\[20]And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

anasseh [was] twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Hephzi-bah.
\[2]And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
\[3]For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them.
\[4]And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.
\[5]And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
\[6]And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he committed much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke [him] to anger.
\[7]And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
\[8]Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.
\[9]But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.
\[10]And the LORD spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,
\[11]Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, [and] hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, who [were] before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols:
\[12]Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I [am] bringing [such] evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.
\[13]And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as [a man] wipeth a dish, wiping [it], and turning [it] upside down.
\[14]And I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;
\[15]Because they have done [that which was] evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day.
\[16]Moreover, Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing evil in the sight of the LORD.
\[17]Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[18]And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
\[19]Amon [was] twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
\[20]And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did.
\[21]And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshiped them:
\[22]And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.
\[23]And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.
\[24]And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.

\[3]And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, [that] the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,
\[4]Go to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered from the people:
\[5]And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work, which [is] in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,
\[6]To carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber, and hewn stone to repair the house.
\[7]But there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.
\[8]And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
\[9]And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.
\[10]And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
\[11]And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.
\[12]And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,
\[13]Go ye, inquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great [is] the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.

\[15]And she said to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,
\[16]Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon its inhabitants, [even] all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read:
\[17]Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place and shall not be quenched.
\[18]But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, [concerning] the words which thou hast heard;
\[19]Because thy heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard [thee], saith the LORD.
\[20]Behold therefore, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thy eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.

nd the king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.
\[2]And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD.
\[3]And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all [their] heart and all [their] soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.
\[4]And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Beth-el.
\[5]And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places around Jerusalem; them also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
\[6]And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped [it] small to powder, and cast the powder of it upon the graves of the children of the people.
\[7]And he broke down the houses of the sodomites that [were] by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.
\[8]And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burnt incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba, and broke down the high places of the gates that [were] in the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which [were] on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.
\[9]Nevertheless, the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they ate of the unleavened bread among their brethren.
\[10]And he defiled Topheth, which [is] in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.
\[11]And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which [was] in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
\[12]And the altars that [were] on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke [them] down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.
\[13]And the high places that [were] before Jerusalem, which [were] on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.
\[14]And he broke in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.
\[15]Moreover, the altar that [was] at Beth-el, [and] the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, [and] stamped [it] small to powder, and burned the grove.
\[16]And as Josiah turned himself, he espied the sepulchers that [were] there on the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchers, and burned [them] upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.
\[17]Then he said, What title [is] that which I see? And the men of the city told him, [It is] the sepulcher of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el.
\[18]And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.
\[19]And all the houses also of the high places that [were] in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke [the LORD] to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el.
\[20]And he slew all the priests of the high places, that [were] there upon the altars, and burnt men's bones upon them, and returned to Jerusalem.
\[21]And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover to the LORD your God, as [it is] written in the book of this covenant.
\[22]Surely there was not held such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah.
\[23]But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, [in which] this passover was held to the LORD in Jerusalem.
\[24]Moreover the [workers with] familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.
\[25]And like him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there [any] like him.
\[26]Notwithstanding, the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations by which Manasseh had provoked him.
\[27]And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will reject this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.
\[28]Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[29]In his days Pharaoh-nechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.
\[30]And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulcher. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.
\[31]Jehoahaz [was] twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\[32]And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.
\[33]And Pharaoh-nechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and subjected the land to a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
\[34]And Pharaoh-nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt and died there.
\[35]And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold from the people of the land, from every one according to his taxation, to give [it] to Pharaoh-nechoh.
\[36]Jehoiakim [was] twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
\[37]And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.

n his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.
\[2]And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servants the prophets.
\[3]Surely at the commandment of the LORD came [this] upon Judah, to remove [them] out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;
\[4]And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon.
\[5]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[6]So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
\[7]And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.
\[8]Jehoiachin [was] eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name [was] Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
\[9]And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done.
\[10]At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
\[11]And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants besieged it.
\[12]And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
\[13]And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.
\[14]And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, [even] ten thousand captives, and all the artificers, and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.
\[15]And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, [those] carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
\[16]And all the men of might, [even] seven thousand, and artificers and smiths a thousand, all [that were] strong [and] apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
\[17]And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
\[18]Zedekiah [was] twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\[19]And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
\[20]For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

nd it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, [that] Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it on all sides.
\[2]And the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
\[3]And on the ninth [day] of the [fourth] month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
\[4]And the city was broken up, and all the men of war [fled] by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which [is] by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees [were] against the city on all sides:) and [the king] went the way towards the plain.
\[5]And the army of the Chaldees pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.
\[6]So they took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.
\[7]And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.
\[8]And in the fifth month, on the seventh [day] of the month, which [is] the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem:
\[9]And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great [man's] house he burnt with fire.
\[10]And all the army of the Chaldees, that [were with] the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem on all sides.
\[11]Now the rest of the people [that were] left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carry away.
\[12]But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land [to be] vine-dressers and husbandmen.
\[13]And the pillars of brass that [were] in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that [was] in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.
\[14]And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, they took away.
\[15]And the fire-pans, and the bowls, [and] such things as [were] of gold, [in] gold, and of silver, [in] silver, the captain of the guard took away.
\[16]The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
\[17]The hight of the one pillar [was] eighteen cubits, and the capital upon it [was] brass: and the hight of the capital three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the capital around, all of brass: and like to these had the second pillar with wreathen work.
\[18]And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:
\[19]And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, who were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land [that were] found in the city:
\[20]And Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:
\[21]And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.
\[22]And [as for] the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.
\[23]And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of Maachathite, they and their men.
\[24]And Gedaliah swore to them, and to their men, and said to them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.
\[25]But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.
\[26]And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees.
\[27]And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth [day] of the month, [that] Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;
\[28]And he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that [were] with him in Babylon;
\[29]And changed his prison garments: and he ate bread continually before him all the days of his life.
\[30]And his allowance [was] a continual allowance given him by the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.

\[20]And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that [were] with them: for they cried to God in the battle, and he was entreated by them; because they put their trust in him.
\[21]And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men a hundred thousand.
\[22]For there fell down many slain, because the war [was] of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.

\[3]And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh;
\[4]Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Pharez the son of Judah.

\[9]And their brethren, according to their generations, nine hundred and fifty and six. All these men [were] chief of the fathers in the house of their fathers.
\[10]And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin,
\[11]And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God;

\[18]Who hitherto [waited] in the king's gate eastward: they [were] porters in the companies of the children of Levi.
\[19]And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren of the house of his father, the Korahites, [were] over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, [being] over the host of the LORD, [were] keepers of the entry.

\[29][Some] of them also [were] appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.
\[30]And [some] of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices.
\[31]And Mattithiah, [one] of the Levites, who [was] the first-born of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans.
\[32]And [others] of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, [were] over the show-bread, to prepare [it] every sabbath.
\[33]And these [are] the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, [who remaining] in the chambers [were] free: for they were employed in [that] work day and night.
\[34]These chief fathers of the Levites [were] chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.
\[35]And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name [was] Maachah:
\[36]And his first-born son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab,

\[2]And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
\[3]And the battle prevailed against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded by the archers.
\[4]Then said Saul to his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was greatly afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
\[5]And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.
\[6]So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.
\[7]And when all the men of Israel that [were] in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
\[8]And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
\[9]And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines around, to carry tidings to their idols, and to the people.
\[10]And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
\[11]And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
\[12]They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
\[13]So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, [even] against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking [counsel] of [one that had] a familiar spirit, to inquire [of it];
\[14]And inquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.

\[2]And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou [wast] he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.
\[3]Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.
\[4]And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which [is] Jebus; where the Jebusites [were], the inhabitants of the land.
\[5]And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which [is] the city of David.
\[6]And David said, Whoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was chief.
\[7]And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it, The city of David.
\[8]And he built the city around, even from Millo around: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
\[9]So David became greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts [was] with him.
\[10]These also [are] the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, [and] with all Israel, to make him king according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
\[11]And this [is] the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam a Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted his spear against three hundred slain [by him] at one time.
\[12]And after him [was] Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who [was one] of the three mighties.
\[13]He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.
\[14]And they set themselves in the midst of [that] parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved [them] by a great deliverance.
\[15]Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
\[16]And David [was] then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison [was] then at Beth-lehem.
\[17]And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, that [is] at the gate!
\[18]And the three broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that [was] by the gate, and took [it], and brought [it] to David: but David would not drink [of] it, but poured it out to the LORD,
\[19]And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with [the jeopardy of] their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.
\[20]And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting his spear against three hundred, he slew [them], and had a name among the three.
\[21]Of the three, he was more honorable than the two; for he was their captain: but he attained not to the [first] three.
\[22]Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lion-like men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.
\[23]And he slew an Egyptian, a man of [great] stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand [was] a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
\[24]These [things] did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.
\[25]Behold, he was honorable among the thirty, but attained not to the [first] three: and David set him over his guard.
\[26]Also the valiant men of the armies [were], Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,

\[15]These [are] they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all [them] of the valleys, [both] towards the east, and towards the west.
\[16]And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold to David.
\[17]And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If ye have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you: but if [ye have come] to betray me to my enemies, seeing [there is] no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look [on it], and rebuke [it].
\[18]Then the spirit came upon Amasai, [who was] chief of the captains, [and he said], Thine [are we], David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace [be] to thee, and peace [be] to thy helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.
\[19]And there fell [some] of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to [the jeopardy of] our heads.
\[20]And as he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that [were] of Manasseh.
\[21]And they helped David against the band [of the rovers]: for they [were] all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the host.
\[22]For at [that] time day by day there came to David to help him, until [it was] a great host, like the host of God.
\[23]And these [are] the numbers of the bands [that were] ready armed to the war, [and] came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.
\[24]The children of Judah that bore shield and spear [were] six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed for war.
\[25]Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valor for war, seven thousand and one hundred.
\[26]Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.
\[27]And Jehoiada [was] the leader of the Aaronites, and with him [were] three thousand and seven hundred;
\[28]And Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his father's house twenty and two captains.
\[29]And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.
\[30]And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous throughout the house of their fathers.
\[31]And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were expressed by name, to come and make David king.
\[32]And of the children of Issachar, [who were men] that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them [were] two hundred; and all their brethren [were] at their command.
\[33]Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, who could keep rank: [they were] not of double heart.

\[40]Moreover, they that were nigh them, [even] to Issachar, and Zebulun, and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, [and] provision, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for [there was] joy in Israel.

\[3]And let us bring again to us the ark of our God: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul.
\[4]And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

\[12]And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God [home] to me?
\[13]So David brought not the ark to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.

\[12]And said to them, Ye [are] the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, [both] ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel to [the place that] I have prepared for it.
\[13]For because ye [did it] not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.
\[14]So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.
\[15]And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staffs on it, as Moses commanded, according to the word of the LORD.
\[16]And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren [to be] the singers with instruments of music, psalteries, and harps, and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.
\[17]So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
\[18]And with them their brethren of the second [degree], Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters.
\[19]So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, [were appointed] to sound with cymbals of brass;
\[20]And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;
\[21]And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.
\[22]And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, [was] for song: he instructed about the song, because he [was] skillful.
\[23]And Berechiah and Elkanah [were] door-keepers for the ark.
\[24]And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah [were] door-keepers for the ark.
\[25]So David and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom with joy.
\[26]And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.
\[27]And David [was] clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also [had] upon him an ephod of linen.
\[28]Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.
\[29]And it came to pass, [as] the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul, looking out at a window, saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.

o they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-sacrifices and peace-offerings before God.
\[2]And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
\[3]And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon [of wine].
\[4]And he appointed [certain] of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:
\[5]Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;
\[6]Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.
\[7]Then on that day David delivered first [this psalm] to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.
\[8]Give thanks to the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.
\[9]Sing to him, sing psalms to him, talk ye of all his wonderous works.
\[10]Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
\[11]Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.
\[12]Remember his wonderful works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
\[13]O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
\[14]He [is] the LORD our God; his judgments [are] in all the earth.
\[15]Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word [which] he commanded to a thousand generations;
\[16][Even of the covenant] which he made with Abraham, and of his oath to Isaac;
\[17]And which he confirmed to Jacob for a law, [and] to Israel [for] an everlasting covenant,
\[18]Saying, To thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;
\[19]When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.
\[20]And [when] they went from nation to nation, and from [one] kingdom to another people;
\[21]He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
\[22][Saying], Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
\[23]Sing to the LORD, all the earth; show forth from day to day his salvation.
\[24]Declare his glory among the heathen; his wonderful works among all nations.
\[25]For great [is] the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also [is] to be feared above all gods.
\[26]For all the gods of the people [are] idols: but the LORD made the heavens.
\[27]Glory and honor [are] in his presence; strength and gladness [are] in his place.
\[28]Give to the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give to the LORD glory and strength.
\[29]Give to the LORD the glory [due] to his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
\[30]Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.
\[31]Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let [men] say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.
\[32]Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that [is] therein.
\[33]Then shall the trees of the wood sing at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.
\[34]O give thanks to the LORD; for [he is] good; for his mercy [endureth] for ever.
\[35]And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, [and] glory in thy praise.
\[36]Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.
\[37]So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required:
\[38]And Obed-edom with their brethren, sixty and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah [to be] porters:
\[39]And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that [was] at Gibeon,
\[40]To offer burnt-offerings to the LORD upon the altar of the burnt-offering continually morning and evening, and [to do] according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;
\[41]And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy [endureth] for ever;
\[42]And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun [were] porters.

ow it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD [remaineth] under curtains.
\[2]Then Nathan said to David, Do all that [is] in thy heart; for God [is] with thee.
\[3]And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
\[4]Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in:
\[5]For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from [one] tabernacle [to another].
\[6]Wherever I have walked with all Israel, have I spoken a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedars?
\[7]Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheep-cote, [even] from following the sheep, that thou shouldst be ruler over my people Israel:
\[8]And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thy enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that [are] in the earth.
\[9]Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning.
\[10]And since the time that I commanded judges [to be] over my people Israel. Moreover, I will subdue all thy enemies. Furthermore, I tell thee that the LORD will build thee a house.
\[11]And it shall come to pass, when thy days shall be ended that thou must go [to be] with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
\[12]He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.
\[13]I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took [it] from [him] that was before thee:
\[14]But I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.
\[15]According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.
\[16]And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who [am] I, O LORD God, and what [is] my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
\[17]And [yet] this was a small thing in thy eyes, O God; for thou hast [also] spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.
\[18]What can David [speak] more to thee for the honor of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.
\[19]O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thy own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all [these] great things.
\[20]O LORD, [there] is none like thee, neither [is there any] God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
\[21]And what one nation in the earth [is] like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem [to be] his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?
\[22]For thy people Israel didst thou make thy own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.
\[23]Therefore now, LORD, Let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.
\[24]Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts [is] the God of Israel, [even] a God to Israel: and [let] the house of David thy servant [be] established before thee.
\[25]For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore thy servant hath found [in his heart] to pray before thee.
\[26]And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness to thy servant:
\[27]Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and [it shall be] blessed for ever.

\[2]And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, [and] brought gifts.
\[3]And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.
\[4]And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot-[horses], but reserved of them a hundred chariots.
\[5]And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
\[6]Then David put [garrisons] in Syria-damascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, [and] brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
\[7]And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
\[8]Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, David brought very much brass, with which Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
\[9]Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;
\[10]He sent Hadoram his son to king David to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had warred with Tou;) and [with him] all manner of vessels of gold, and silver, and brass.
\[11]Them also king David dedicated to the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all [these] nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.
\[12]Moreover, Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.
\[13]And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

ow it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.
\[2]And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
\[3]But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, that he hath sent comforters to thee? are not his servants come to thee to search, and to overthrow, and to explore the land?
\[4]Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.
\[5]Then there went [certain], and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards are grown, and [then] return.
\[6]And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.
\[7]So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon assembled from their cities, and came to battle.
\[8]And when David heard [of it], he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
\[9]And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that had come [were] by themselves in the field.
\[10]Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he selected all the choice of Israel, and put [them] in array against the Syrians.
\[11]And the rest of the people he delivered to the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set [themselves] in array against the children of Ammon.
\[12]And he said, If the Syrians shall be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon shall be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.
\[13]Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do [that which is] good in his sight.
\[14]So Joab and the people that [were] with him drew nigh before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.
\[15]And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
\[16]And when the Syrians saw that they were defeated before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that [were] beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer [went] before them.
\[17]And it was told to David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set [the battle] in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
\[18]But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand [men who fought in] chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.
\[19]And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.

\[2]And David took the crown of their king from his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and [there were] precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also a great quantity of spoil out of the city.
\[3]And he brought out the people that [were] in it, and cut [them] with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so David dealt with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

\[2]And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know [it].
\[3]And Joab answered, the LORD make his people a hundred times more numerous than they [are]: but, my lord the king, [are] they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?
\[4]Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
\[5]And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David. And all [they of] Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah [was] four hundred and seventy thousand men that drew sword.
\[6]But Levi and Benjamin he counted not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.
\[7]And God was displeased with this thing, therefore he smote Israel.
\[8]And David said to God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
\[9]And the LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,
\[10]Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee [three] things; choose thee one of them, that I may do [it] to thee.
\[11]So Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee
\[12]Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while the sword of thy enemies overtaketh [thee]; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.
\[13]And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great [are] his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.
\[14]So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
\[15]And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thy hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\[16]And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders [of Israel], [who were] clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
\[17]And David said to God, [Is it] not I [that] commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but [as for] these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be afflicted.
\[18]Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and erect an altar to the LORD in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\[19]And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the LORD.
\[20]And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
\[21]And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked, and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with [his] face to the ground.
\[22]Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of [this] threshing-floor, that I may build an altar in it to the LORD: thou shalt grant it to me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.
\[23]And Ornan said to David, Take [it] to thee, and let my lord the king do [that which is] good in his eyes: lo, I give [thee] the oxen [also] for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat-offering; I give it all.
\[24]And king David said to Ornan, No; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take [that] which [is] thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt-offerings without cost.
\[25]So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
\[26]And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering.
\[27]And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath.
\[28]At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
\[29]For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt-offering, [were] at that season in the high place at Gibeon.

\[3]And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;
\[4]Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.

\[6]Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel.
\[7]And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house to the name of the LORD my God:
\[8]But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build a house to my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.
\[9]Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies around: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.
\[10]He shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I [will be] his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.
\[11]Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.
\[12]Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.
\[13]Then shalt thou prosper, if thou shalt take heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.
\[14]Now behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add to them.
\[15]Moreover, [there are] workmen with thee in great numbers, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of skillful men for every manner of work.
\[16]Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, [there is] no number. Arise [therefore], and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.
\[17]David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, [saying],
\[18][Is] not the LORD your God with you? and hath he [not] given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.
\[19]Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise, therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.

\[12]The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
\[13]The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister to him, and to bless in his name for ever.
\[14]Now [concerning] Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.
\[15]The sons of Moses [were], Gershom, and Eliezer.
\[16]Of the sons of Gershom; Shebuel [was] the chief.

\[18]Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.
\[19]Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jehaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
\[20]Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first, and Jesiah the second.
\[21]The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.
\[22]And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.
\[23]The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
\[24]These [were] the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; [even] the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.
\[25]For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest to his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever;
\[26]And also to the Levites: they shall no [more] carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for its service.
\[27]For by the last words of David the Levites [were] numbered from twenty years old and above:
\[28]Because their office [was] to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;
\[29]Both for the show-bread, and for the fine flour for meat-offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for [that which is baked in] the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;
\[30]And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at evening;
\[31]And to offer all burnt-sacrifices to the LORD on the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded to them, continually before the LORD:
\[32]And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy [place], and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.

\[2]But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priests' office.
\[3]And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.
\[4]And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and [thus] were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar [there were] sixteen chief men of the house of [their] fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers.
\[5]Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors [of the house] of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.
\[6]And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, [one] of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and [before] the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and [one] taken for Ithamar.

\[19]These [were] the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.
\[20]And the rest of the sons of Levi [were these]: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.

\[23]And the sons [of Hebron]; Jeriah [the first], Amariah the second, Jehaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.
\[24][Of] the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir.
\[25]The brother of Michah [was] Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah.

\[27]The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.
\[28]Of Mahli [came] Eleazar, who had no sons.
\[29]Concerning Kish: the son of Kish [was] Jerahmeel.
\[30]The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These [were] the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.
\[31]These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.

\[2]Then David the king stood upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: [As for me], I [had] in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building:
\[3]But God said to me, Thou shalt not build a house for my name, because thou [hast been] a man of war, and hast shed blood.
\[4]However the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah [to be] the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he approved me to make [me] king over all Israel:
\[5]And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.
\[6]And he said to me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him [to be] my son, and I will be his father.
\[7]Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he shall be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.
\[8]Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave [it] for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.
\[9]And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou shalt seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou shalt forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.
\[10]Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do [it].
\[11]Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses of it, and of its treasuries, and of its upper chambers, and of its inner parlors, and of the place of the mercy-seat,
\[12]And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers around, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:
\[13]Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.
\[14][He gave] of gold by weight for [things] of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; [silver also] for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:
\[15]Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for its lamps: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, [both] for the candlestick, and [also] for its lamps, according to the use of every candlestick.
\[16]And by weight [he gave] gold for the tables of show-bread, for every table; and [likewise] silver for the tables of silver:
\[17]Also pure gold for the flesh-hooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basins [he gave gold] by weight for every basin; and [likewise silver] by weight for every basin of silver:
\[18]And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim, that spread out [their wings], and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
\[19]All [this], [said David], the LORD made me understand in writing by [his] hand upon me, [even] all the works of this pattern.
\[20]And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong, and of good courage, and do [it]: fear not, nor be dismayed, for the LORD God, [even] my God, [will be] with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.
\[21]And behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, [even they shall be with thee] for all the service of the house of God: and [there shall be] with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skillful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people [will be] wholly at thy command.

urthermore David the king said to all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, [is yet] young and tender, and the work [is] great: for the palace [is] not for man, but for the LORD God.
\[2]Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for [things to he made] of gold, and the silver for [things] of silver, and the brass for [things] of brass, the iron for [things] of iron, and wood for [things] of wood; onyx-stones, and [stones] to be set, glittering stones, and of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
\[3]Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of my own possessions, of gold and silver, [which] I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,
\[4][Even] three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses:
\[5]The gold for [things] of gold, and the silver for [things] of silver, and for all manner of work [to be made] by the hands of artificers. And who [then] is willing to consecrate his service this day to the LORD?
\[6]Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's work, offered willingly,
\[7]And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.
\[8]And they with whom [precious] stones were found gave [them] to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
\[9]Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
\[10]Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed [be] thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.
\[11]Thine, O LORD, [is] the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all [that is] in the heaven and on the earth [is thine]; thine [is] the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.
\[12]Both riches and honor [come] from thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thy hand [is] power and might; and in thy hand [it is] to make great, and to give strength to all.
\[13]Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.
\[14]But who [am] I, and what [is] my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things [come] from thee, and of thy own have we given thee.
\[15]For we [are] strangers before thee, and sojourners, as [were] all our fathers: our days on the earth [are] as a shadow, and [there is] no abiding.
\[16]O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name [cometh] from thy hand, and [is] all thy own.
\[17]I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, who are present here, to offer willingly to thee.
\[18]O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart to thee:
\[19]And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all [these things], and to build the palace, [for] which I have made provision.
\[20]And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed their heads, and worshiped the LORD, and the king.
\[21]And they sacrificed sacrifices to the LORD, and offered burnt-offerings to the LORD, on the morrow after that day, [even] a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, [and] a thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:
\[22]And ate and drank before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed [him] to the LORD [to be] the chief governor, and Zadok [to be] priest.
\[23]Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.
\[24]And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king.
\[25]And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him [such] royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
\[26]Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
\[27]And the time that he reigned over Israel [was] forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty and three [years] he reigned in Jerusalem.
\[28]And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
\[29]Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they [are] written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,
\[30]With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.

nd Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God [was] with him, and magnified him exceedingly.
\[2]Then Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.
\[3]So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that [was] at Gibeon: for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.
\[4]But the ark of God David had brought up from Kirjath-jearim to [the place which] David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
\[5]Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought to it.
\[6]And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before the LORD, which [was] at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt-offerings upon it.
\[7]In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give thee.
\[8]And Solomon said to God, Thou hast shown great mercy to David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.
\[9]Now, O LORD God, let thy promise to David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.
\[10]Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy great people?
\[11]And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of thy enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:
\[12]Wisdom and knowledge [are] granted to thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that [have been] before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.
\[13]Then Solomon came [from his journey] to the high place that [was] at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.
\[14]And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\[15]And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem [as plenteous] as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycamore trees that [are] in the vale for abundance.
\[16]And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
\[17]And they fetched up, and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so they brought out [horses] for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.

nd Solomon determined to build a house for the name of the LORD, and a house for his kingdom.
\[2]And Solomon numbered out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
\[3]And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell in it, [even so deal with me].
\[4]Behold, I build a house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate [it] to him, [and] to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual show-bread, and for the burnt-offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This [is an ordinance] for ever to Israel.
\[5]And the house which I build [is] great: for great [is] our God above all gods.
\[6]But who is able to build him a house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who [am] I then that I should build him a house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?
\[7]Send me now therefore a man skillful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that hath skill to grave with the skillful men that [are] with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.
\[8]Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants have skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and behold, my servants [shall be] with thy servants,
\[9]Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build [shall be] wonderfully great.
\[10]And behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
\[11]Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.
\[12]Huram said moreover, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that may build a house for the LORD, and a house for his kingdom.
\[13]And now I have sent a skillful man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,
\[14]The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father [was] a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to engrave any manner of engraving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy skillful men, and with the skillful men of my lord David thy father.
\[15]Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine which my lord hath spoken of, let him send to his servants;
\[16]And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou mayest convey it to Jerusalem.
\[17]And Solomon numbered all the strangers that [were] in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.
\[18]And he set seventy thousand of them [to be] bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand [to be] hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people to work.

hen Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where [the LORD] appeared to David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\[2]And he began to build in the second [day] of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
\[3]Now these [are the things in which] Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure [was] sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
\[4]And the porch that [was] in the front [of the house], the length [of it was] according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the hight [was] a hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
\[5]And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set on it palm trees and chains.
\[6]And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold [was] gold of Parvaim.
\[7]He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls of it, and the doors of it, with gold; and engraved cherubim on the walls.
\[8]And he made the most holy house, the length of which [was] according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, [amounting] to six hundred talents.
\[9]And the weight of the nails [was] fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
\[10]And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work, and overlaid them with gold.
\[11]And the wings of the cherubim [were] twenty cubits long: one wing [of the one cherub was] five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing [was likewise] five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
\[12]And [one] wing of the other cherub [was] five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing [was] five cubits [also], joining to the wing of the other cherub.
\[13]The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces [were] inward.
\[14]And he made the vail [of] blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim upon it.
\[15]Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that [was] on the top of each of them [was] five cubits.
\[16]And he made chains, [as] in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made a hundred pomegranates, and put [them] on the chains.
\[17]And he erected the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.

\[2]Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the hight of it; and a line of thirty cubits encompassed it.
\[3]And under it [was] the similitude of oxen, which encompassed it: ten in a cubit, encompassing the sea. Two rows of oxen [were] cast, when it was cast.
\[4]It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking towards the north, and three looking towards the west, and three looking towards the south, and three looking towards the east: and the sea [was set] above upon them, and all their hinder parts [were] inward.
\[5]And the thickness of it [was] a hand-breadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; [and] it received and held three thousand baths.
\[6]He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt-offering they washed in them; but the sea [was] for the priests to wash in.
\[7]And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set [them] in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
\[8]He made also ten tables, and placed [them] in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold.
\[9]Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
\[10]And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.
\[11]And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;
\[12][To wit], the two pillars, and the pommels, and the capitals [which were] on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the capitals which [were] on the top of the pillars;
\[13]And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the capitals which [were] upon the pillars.
\[14]He made also bases, and lavers he made upon the bases;
\[15]One sea, and twelve oxen under it.
\[16]The pots also, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass.
\[17]In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.
\[18]Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be ascertained.
\[19]And Solomon made all the vessels that [were for] the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables on which the show-bread [was set];
\[20]Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;
\[21]And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, [made he of] gold, [and] that perfect gold;
\[22]And the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers, [of] pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors of it for the most holy [place], and the doors of the house of the temple, [were of] gold.

hus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in [all] the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, he put among the treasures of the house of God.
\[2]Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the city of David, which [is] Zion.
\[3]Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king in the feast which [was] in the seventh month.
\[4]And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.
\[5]And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that [were] in the tabernacle, these did the priests [and] the Levites bring up.
\[6]Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled to him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
\[7]And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy [place], [even] under the wings of the cherubim:
\[8]For the cherubim spread forth [their] wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark, and the staffs of it above.
\[9]And they drew out the staffs [of the ark], that the ends of the staffs were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is to this day.
\[10][There was] nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put [in it] at Horeb, when the LORD made [a covenant] with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
\[11]And it came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy [place]: (for all the priests [that were] present were sanctified, [and] did not [then] wait by course:
\[12]Also the Levites [who were] the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren; [being] arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)
\[13]It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers [were] as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up [their] voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, [saying], For [he is] good; for his mercy [endureth] for ever: that [then] the house was filled with a cloud, [even] the house of the LORD;

\[2]But I have built a house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.
\[3]And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.
\[4]And he said, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled [that] which he spoke with his mouth to my father David, saying,
\[5]Since the day that I brought forth my people from the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:
\[6]But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
\[7]Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel:
\[8]But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thy heart;
\[9]Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son who shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.
\[10]The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken; for I am raised up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
\[11]And in it have I put the ark, in which [is] the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.
\[12]And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:
\[13](For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands towards heaven,)
\[14]And said, O LORD God of Israel, [there is] no God like thee in the heaven, nor on the earth; who keepest covenant, and [showest] mercy to thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:
\[15]Thou who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and hast spoken with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled [it] with thy hand, as [it is] this day.
\[16]Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; provided thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.
\[17]Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken to thy servant David.
\[18]But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!
\[19]Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken to the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:
\[20]That thy eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place of which thou hast said, that thou wouldst put thy name there; to hearken to the prayer which thy servant prayeth towards this place.
\[21]Hearken therefore to the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make towards this place: hear thou from thy dwelling-place, [even] from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.
\[22]If a man shall sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath shall come before thy altar in this house;
\[23]Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.
\[24]And if thy people Israel shall be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;
\[25]Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again to the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
\[26]When the heaven is shut, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; [yet] if they pray towards this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them;
\[27]Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
\[28]If there shall be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillars; if their enemies shall besiege them in the cities of their land; whatever calamity, or whatever sickness [there be]:
\[29][Then] whatever prayer, [or] whatever supplication shall be made by any man, or by all the people of Israel, when every one shall know his own calamity, and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:
\[30]Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)
\[31]That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest to our fathers.
\[32]Moreover concerning the stranger, who is not of thy people Israel, but hath come from a distant country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy out-stretched arm; if they come and pray in this house;
\[33]Then hear thou from the heavens, [even] from thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as [do] thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
\[34]If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray to thee towards this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;
\[35]Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
\[36]If they sin against thee, (for [there is] no man who sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before [their] enemies, and they carry them away captives to a land far off or near;
\[37]Yet [if] they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray to thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;
\[38]If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray towards their land which thou gavest to their fathers, and [towards] the city which thou hast chosen, and towards the house which I have built for thy name:
\[39]Then hear thou from the heavens, [even] from thy dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee.
\[40]Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thy eyes be open, and [let] thy ears [be] attentive to the prayer [that is made] in this place.
\[41]Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.

ow when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.
\[2]And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD'S house.
\[3]And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshiped, and praised the LORD, [saying], For [he is] good; for his mercy [endureth] for ever.
\[4]Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.
\[5]And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
\[6]And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy [endureth] for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.
\[7]Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that [was] before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offerings, and the meat-offerings, and the fat.
\[8]Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entrance of Hamath to the river of Egypt.
\[9]And on the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.
\[10]And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shown to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.
\[11]Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.
\[12]And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.
\[13]If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;
\[14]If my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
\[15]Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive to the prayer [that is made] in this place.
\[16]For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
\[17]And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;
\[18]Then will I establish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man [to be] ruler in Israel.
\[19]But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;
\[20]Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it [to be] a proverb and a by-word among all nations.
\[21]And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus to this land, and to this house?
\[22]And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.

\[3]And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.
\[4]And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.
\[5]Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;

\[8][But] of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.

\[10]And these [were] the chief of king Solomon's officers, [even] two hundred and fifty, that bore rule over the people.
\[11]And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh from the city of David to the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because [the places are] holy, to which the ark of the LORD hath come.
\[12]Then Solomon offered burnt-offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,

\[2]And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.
\[3]And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
\[4]And the provisions of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cup-bearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
\[5]And she said to the king, [It was] a true report which I heard in my own land of thy acts, and of thy wisdom:
\[6]Yet, I believed not their words, until I came, and my eyes had seen [it]: and behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told to me: [for] thou exceedest the fame that I heard.
\[7]Happy [are] thy men, and happy [are] these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.
\[8]Blessed be the LORD thy God, who delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, [to be] king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore he made thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.
\[9]And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
\[10]And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.
\[11]And the king made [of] the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.
\[12]And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides [that] which she had brought to the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.
\[13]Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty and six talents of gold;
\[14]Besides [that which] chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
\[15]And king Solomon made two hundred targets [of] beaten gold: six hundred [shekels] of beaten gold went to one target.
\[16]And three hundred shields [made he of] beaten gold: three hundred [shekels] of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
\[17]Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
\[18]And [there were] six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, [which were] fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting-place, and two lions standing by the stays:
\[19]And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.
\[20]And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon [were of] gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon [were of] pure gold: none [were of] silver; it was [not] any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
\[21]For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: once every three years came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
\[22]And king Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
\[23]And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.
\[24]And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
\[25]And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\[26]And he reigned over all the kings from the river even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
\[27]And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees he made as the sycamore trees that [are] in the low plains in abundance.
\[28]And they brought to Solomon horses from Egypt, and from all lands.
\[29]Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, [are] they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?

\[2]And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who [was] in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard [it], that Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
\[3]And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
\[4]Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
\[5]And he said to them, Come again to me after three days. And the people departed.
\[6]And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye [me] to return answer to this people?
\[7]And they spoke to him, saying, If thou wilt be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.
\[8]But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.
\[9]And he said to them, What advice give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father put upon us?
\[10]And the young men that were brought up with him, spoke to him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spoke to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou [it] somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say to them, My little [finger] shall be thicker than my father's loins.
\[11]For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions.
\[12]So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king directed, saying, Come again to me on the third day.
\[13]And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
\[14]And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father chastised you with whips, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions.
\[15]So the king hearkened not to the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\[16]And when all Israel [saw] that the king would not hearken to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and [we have] no inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: [and] now, David, see to thy own house. So all Israel went to their tents.
\[17]But [as for] the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
\[18]Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that [was] over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get into his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.

\[2]But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
\[3]Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
\[4]Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done by me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.
\[5]And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.
\[6]He built even Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
\[7]And Beth-zur, and Shocho, and Adullam,
\[8]And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
\[9]And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
\[10]And Zorah, and Ajalon, and Hebron, which [are] in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.
\[11]And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of provisions, and of oil and wine.
\[12]And in every several city [he put] shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.
\[13]And the priests and the Levites that [were] in all Israel resorted to him from all their borders.
\[14]For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office to the LORD:
\[15]And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.
\[16]And after them out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice to the LORD God of their fathers.
\[17]So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.
\[18]And Rehoboam took to himself Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David for a wife, [and] Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;
\[19]Who bore him children, Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.
\[20]And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; who bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
\[21]And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and sixty concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and sixty daughters.)
\[22]And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, [to be] ruler among his brethren: for [he thought] to make him king.
\[23]And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city: and he gave them provisions in abundance. And he desired many wives.

\[2]And it came to pass, [that] in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,
\[3]With twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen: and the people [were] without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Cushites.
\[4]And he took the fortified cities which [pertained] to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.
\[5]Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and [to] the princes of Judah, that were assembled at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
\[6]Upon which the princes of Israel, and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD [is] righteous.
\[7]And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; [therefore] I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
\[8]Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
\[9]So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
\[10]Instead of which, king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed [them] to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.
\[11]And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and conveyed them, and brought them again into the guard-chamber.
\[12]And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy [him] altogether: and also in Judah things went well.
\[13]So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam [was] one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name [was] Naamah an Ammonitess.
\[14]And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.

\[2]He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also [was] Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
\[3]And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, [even] four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, [being] mighty men of valor.
\[4]And Abijah stood upon mount Zemaraim, which [is] in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;
\[5]Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, [even] to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
\[6]Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat the servant of Solomon the son of David, hath risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.
\[7]And there are gathered to him vain men, the children of Belial, and [they] have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.
\[8]And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye [are] a great multitude, and [there are] with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.
\[9]Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made for you priests after the manner of the nations of [other] lands? so that whoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, [the same] may be a priest of [them that are] no gods.
\[10]But as for us, the LORD [is] our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, who minister to the LORD, [are] the sons of Aaron, and the Levites [wait] upon [their] business:
\[11]And they burn to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt-sacrifices and sweet incense: the show-bread also [they set in order] upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with its lamps to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.
\[12]And behold, God himself [is] with us for [our] captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye will not prosper.
\[13]But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambush [was] behind them.
\[14]And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle [was] before and behind: and they cried to the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
\[15]Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
\[16]And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.
\[17]And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
\[18]Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.
\[19]And Abijah pursued Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with its towns, and Jeshanah with its towns, and Ephron with its towns.
\[20]Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.
\[21]But Abijah became mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.

\[2]And Asa did [that which was] good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:
\[3]For he took away the altars of the strange [gods], and the high places, and broke down the images, and cut down the groves:
\[4]And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.
\[5]Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.
\[6]And he built fortified cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.
\[7]Therefore he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about [them] walls, and towers, gates, and bars, [while] the land [is] yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought [him], and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built, and prospered.
\[8]And Asa had an army [of men] that bore targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these [were] mighty men of valor.
\[9]And there came out against them Zerah the Cushite, with a host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came to Mareshah.
\[10]Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathath at Mareshah.
\[11]And Asa cried to the LORD his God, and said, LORD, [it is] nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou [art] our God; let not man prevail against thee.
\[12]So the LORD smote the Cushites before Asa, and before Judah; and the Cushites fled.
\[13]And Asa and the people that [were] with him pursued them to Gerar: and the Cushites were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.
\[14]And they smote all the cities about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they plundered all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.

\[6]And nation was destroyed by nation, and city by city: for God troubled them with all adversity.
\[7]Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak; for your work shall be rewarded.
\[8]And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that [was] before the porch of the LORD.

\[4]And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to-day.
\[5]Therefore the king of Israel collected of prophets four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver [it] into the king's hand.
\[6]But Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we may inquire of him?
\[7]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, [There is] yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesieth good to me, but always evil: the same [is] Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
\[8]And the king of Israel called for one [of his] officers, and said, Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
\[9]And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat each of them on his throne, clothed in [their] robes, and they sat in a void place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
\[10]And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they shall be consumed.
\[11]And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD will deliver [it] into the hand of the king.
\[12]And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one consent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.
\[13]And Micaiah said, [As] the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.
\[14]And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.
\[15]And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?
\[16]Then he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return [therefore] every man to his house in peace.
\[17]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee [that] he would not prophesy good to me, but evil?
\[18]Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and [on] his left.
\[19]And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
\[20]Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said to him, With what?
\[21]And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And [the LORD] said, Thou shalt entice [him], and thou shalt also prevail: go out and do [even] so.
\[22]Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.
\[23]Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the spirit of the LORD from me to speak to thee?
\[24]And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
\[25]Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
\[26]And say, Thus saith the king, Put this [man] in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.
\[27]And Micaiah said, If thou shalt certainly return in peace, [then] hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.
\[28]So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
\[29]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.
\[30]Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that [were] with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.
\[31]And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It [is] the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them [to depart] from him.
\[32]For it came to pass, that when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.
\[33]And a [certain] man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot-man, Turn thy hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
\[34]And the battle increased that day: yet the king of Israel supported [himself] in [his] chariot against the Syrians until the evening: and about the time of the sun setting he died.

\[2]And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldst thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore [is] wrath upon thee from before the LORD.
\[3]Nevertheless, there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thy heart to seek God.
\[4]And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back to the LORD God of their fathers.
\[5]And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,
\[6]And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who [is] with you in the judgment.
\[7]Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do [it]: for [there is] no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.
\[8]Moreover, in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and [of] the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem.
\[9]And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.
\[10]And whatever cause shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and [so] wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass.
\[11]And behold, Amariah the chief priest [is] over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites [shall be] officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD will be with the good.

t came to pass after this also, [that] the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them [others] besides the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.
\[2]Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side of Syria; and behold, they [are] in Hazazon-tamar, which [is] En-gedi.
\[3]And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
\[4]And Judah assembled, to ask [help] of the LORD: even from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD.
\[5]And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,
\[6]And said, O LORD God of our fathers, [art] not thou God in heaven? and rulest thou [not] over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thy hand [is there not] power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?
\[7][Art] not thou our God, [who] didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and give it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?
\[8]And they dwelt in it, and have built thee a sanctuary in it for thy name, saying,
\[9]If, [when] evil cometh upon us, [as] the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name [is] in this house,) and cry to thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.
\[10]And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldst not let Israel invade, when they came from the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;
\[11]Behold, [I say], [how] they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.
\[12]O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes [are] upon thee.
\[13]And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.
\[14]Then upon Jehaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;
\[15]And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD to you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle [is] not yours, but God's.
\[16]To-morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.
\[17]Ye shall not [need] to fight in this [battle]: set yourselves, stand ye [still], and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to-morrow go out against them: for the LORD [will be] with you.
\[18]And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with [his] face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshiping the LORD.
\[19]And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.
\[20]And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.
\[21]And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers to the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy [endureth] for ever.
\[22]And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, who were come against Judah; and they were smitten.
\[23]For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy [them]: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.
\[24]And when Judah came towards the watch-tower in the wilderness, they looked to the multitude, and behold, they [were] dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.
\[25]And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering the spoil, it was so much.
\[26]And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place hath been called, The valley of Berachah, to this day.
\[27]Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the front of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.
\[28]And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets to the house of the LORD.
\[29]And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of [those] countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.
\[30]So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest on all sides.
\[31]And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: [he was] thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
\[32]And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD.
\[33]But the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts to the God of their fathers.
\[34]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they [are] written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who [is] mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.
\[35]And after this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:
\[36]And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.
\[37]Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.

ow Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
\[2]And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, Shephatiah: all these [were] the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
\[3]And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah: but the kingdom he gave to Jehoram; because he [was] the first-born.
\[4]Now when Jehoram had risen to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and [divers] also of the princes of Israel.
\[5]Jehoram [was] thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
\[6]And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab for a wife: and he wrought [that which was] evil in the eyes of the LORD.
\[7]Yet the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.
\[8]In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.
\[9]Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites who encompassed him, and the captains of the chariots.
\[10]So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. The same time [also] did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.
\[11]Moreover, he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah to [do the same].
\[12]And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
\[13]But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit idolatry, like the idolatries of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, [who were] better than thyself:
\[14]Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:
\[15]And thou [shalt have] great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.
\[16]Moreover, the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that [were] near the Cushites.
\[17]And they came up into Judah, and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was not a son left to him, save Jehoahaz the youngest of his sons.
\[18]And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.
\[19]And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of severe diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.
\[20]Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem, eight years, and departed without being desired: yet they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchers of the kings.

nd the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.
\[2]Forty and two years old [was] Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also [was] Athaliah the daughter of Omri.
\[3]He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly.
\[4]Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counselors, after the death of his father, to his destruction.
\[5]He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.
\[6]And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.
\[7]And the destruction of Ahaziah was from God by coming to Joram: for when he had come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.
\[8]And it came to pass, that when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.
\[9]And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he [is] the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to retain the kingdom.
\[10]But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose, and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.
\[11]But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bed chamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.
\[12]And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.

\[2]And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
\[3]And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.
\[4]This [is] the thing that ye shall do: A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests, and of the Levites, [shall be] porters of the doors;
\[5]And a third part [shall be] at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people [shall be] in the courts of the house of the LORD.
\[6]But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they [are] holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.
\[7]And the Levites shall encompass the king, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever [else] cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.
\[8]So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go [out] on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.
\[9]Moreover, Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds, spears, and bucklers, and shields, that [had been] king David's, which [were] in the house of God.
\[10]And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king on all sides.
\[11]Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and [gave him] the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.
\[12]Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:
\[13]And she looked, and behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entrance, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of music, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, treason.
\[14]Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said to them, Have her forth without the ranges: and whoever followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.
\[15]So they laid hands on her; and when she had come to the entrance of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.
\[16]And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD'S people.
\[17]Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and broke it down, and broke his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
\[18]Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt-offerings of the LORD, as [it is] written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, [as it was ordained] by David.
\[19]And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none [who was] unclean in any thing should enter.
\[20]And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.

\[2]And Joash did [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
\[3]And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.
\[4]And it came to pass after this, [that] Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD.
\[5]And he convened the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. But the Levites hastened [it] not.
\[6]And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, [according to the commandment] of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?
\[7]For the sons of Athaliah that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD they bestowed upon Baalim.
\[8]And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.
\[9]And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection [that] Moses the servant of God [laid] upon Israel in the wilderness.
\[10]And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
\[11]Now it came to pass, that at the time the chest was brought to the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that [there was] much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and collected money in abundance.
\[12]And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.
\[13]So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in its state, and strengthened it.
\[14]And when they had finished [it], they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, of which were made vessels for the house of the LORD, [even] vessels to minister, and to offer [with], and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt-offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.
\[15]But Jehoiada grew old, and was full of days when he died; a hundred and thirty years old [was] he when he died.
\[16]And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both towards God, and towards his house.
\[17]Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened to them.
\[18]And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.
\[19]Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again to the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.
\[20]And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood above the people, and said to them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.
\[21]And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.
\[22]Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon [it], and require [it].
\[23]And it came to pass at the end of the year, [that] the army of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them to the king of Damascus.
\[24]For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.
\[25]And when they had departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchers of the kings.
\[26]And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.
\[27]Now [concerning] his sons, and the greatness of the burdens [laid] upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they [are] written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

\[5]Moreover, Amaziah assembled Judah, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of [their] fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice [men], [able] to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.
\[6]He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
\[7]But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD [is] not with Israel, [to wit], [with] all the children of Ephraim.
\[8]But if thou wilt go, do [it], be strong for the battle: God will make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.
\[9]And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.
\[10]Then Amaziah separated them, [to wit], the army that had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.
\[11]And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.
\[12]And [other] ten thousand [left] alive the children of Judah carried away captive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they were all broken in pieces.
\[13]But the soldiers of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth-horon, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.
\[14]Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up [to be] his gods, and bowed himself before them, and burned incense to them.
\[15]Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thy hand?
\[16]And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that [the king] said to him, Art thou made of the king's council? forbear? why shouldst thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbore, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened to my counsel.
\[17]Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.
\[18]And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that [was] in Lebanon sent to the cedar that [was] in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son for a wife: and there passed by a wild beast that [was] in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.
\[19]Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thy heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldst thou meddle to [thy] hurt, that thou shouldst fall, [even] thou, and Judah with thee?
\[20]But Amaziah would not hear; for it [came] from God, that he might deliver them into the hand [of their enemies], because they sought after the gods of Edom.
\[21]So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, [both] he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth-shemesh, which [belongeth] to Judah.
\[22]And Judah was defeated before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.
\[23]And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
\[24]And [he took] all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
\[25]And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah, lived after the death of Joash, son of Jehoahaz king of Israel, fifteen years.
\[26]Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, [are] they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
\[27]Now after the time that Amaziah turned away from following the LORD, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.
\[28]And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.

hen all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who [was] sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.
\[2]He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
\[3]Sixteen years old [was] Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also [was] Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
\[4]And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did.
\[5]And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and, as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.
\[6]And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
\[7]And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Mehunims.
\[8]And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad [even] to the entrance of Egypt: for he strengthened [himself] exceedingly.
\[9]Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning [of the wall], and fortified them.
\[10]Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had many cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen [also], and vine-dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.
\[11]Moreover, Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to war, by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, [one] of the king's captains.
\[12]The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valor [were] two thousand and six hundred.
\[13]And under their hand [was] an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
\[14]And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings [to cast] stones.
\[15]And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad; for he was helped in a wonderful manner, till he was strong.
\[16]But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to [his] destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
\[17]And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of the LORD, [that were] valiant men:
\[18]And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said to him, [It appertaineth] not to thee, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither [will it be] for thy honor from the LORD God.
\[19]Then Uzziah was wroth, and [had] a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.
\[20]And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests looked upon him, and behold, he [was] leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.
\[21]And Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, [being] a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son [was] over the king's house, judging the people of the land.
\[22]Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, were written by Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amos.
\[23]So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which [belonged] to the kings; for they said, He [is] a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.

otham [was] twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also [was] Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.
\[2]And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah did: yet, he entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly.
\[3]He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.
\[4]Moreover, he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.
\[5]He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay to him, both the second year, and the third.
\[6]So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.
\[7]Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, see, they [are] written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
\[8]He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

haz [was] twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father:
\[2]For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.
\[3]Moreover, he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
\[4]He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
\[5]Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought [them] to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.
\[6]For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, [who were] all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.
\[7]And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah [that was] next to the king.
\[8]And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and also took away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
\[9]But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name [was] Oded: and he went out before the army that came to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage [that] reacheth to heaven.
\[10]And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bond-men and bond-women to you: [but are there] not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?
\[11]Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD [is] upon you.
\[12]Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war.
\[13]And said to them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD [already], ye intend to add [more] to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass [is] great, and [there is] fierce wrath against Israel.
\[14]So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.
\[15]And the men who were expressed by name arose, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.
\[16]At that time king Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him.
\[17]For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.
\[18]The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with its villages, and Timnah with its villages, Gimzo also and its villages: and they dwelt there.
\[19]For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel: for he made Judah naked, and greatly transgressed against the LORD.
\[20]And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.
\[21]For Ahaz took away a portion from the house of the LORD, and from the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave [it] to the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.
\[22]And in the time of his distress he trespassed yet more against the LORD: this [is that] king Ahaz.
\[23]For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, [therefore] will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
\[24]And Ahaz collected the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
\[25]And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.
\[26]Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they [are] written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\[27]And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, [even] in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchers of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

ezekiah began to reign [when he was] five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Abijah the daughter of Zechariah.
\[2]And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done.
\[3]He, in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.
\[4]And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and assembled them in the east street,
\[5]And said to them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy [place].
\[6]For our fathers have trespassed, and done [that which was] evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned [their] backs.
\[7]Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt-offerings in the holy [place] to the God of Israel.
\[8]Wherefore the wrath of the LORD hath been upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.
\[9]For lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives [are] in captivity for this.
\[10]Now [it is] in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.
\[11]My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister to him, and burn incense.
\[12]Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:
\[13]And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:
\[14]And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.
\[15]And they assembled their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.
\[16]And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse [it], and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took [it], to carry [it] out abroad into the brook Kidron.
\[17]Now they began on the first [day] of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
\[18]Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt-offering, with all its vessels, and the show-bread table, with all its vessels.
\[19]Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and behold, they [are] before the altar of the LORD.
\[20]Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and convened the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.
\[21]And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin-offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer [them] on the altar of the LORD.
\[22]So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled [it] on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.
\[23]And they brought forth the he-goats [for] the sin-offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:
\[24]And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded [that] the burnt-offering and the sin-offering [should be made] for all Israel.
\[25]And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for [so was] the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.
\[26]And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
\[27]And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt-offering upon the altar. And when the burnt-offering began, the song of the LORD began [also] with the trumpets, and with the instruments [ordained] by David king of Israel.
\[28]And all the congregation worshiped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: [and] all [this continued] until the burnt-offering was finished.
\[29]And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshiped.
\[30]Moreover, Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise to the LORD, with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped.
\[31]Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves to the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and, as many as were of a free heart, burnt-offerings.
\[32]And the number of the burnt-offerings, which the congregation brought, was seventy bullocks, a hundred rams: [and] two hundred lambs: all these [were] for a burnt-offering to the LORD.
\[33]And the consecrated things [were] six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
\[34]But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites helped them, till the work was ended, and until the [other] priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites [were] more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
\[35]And also the burnt-offerings [were] in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and the drink-offerings for [every] burnt-offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.
\[36]And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was [done] suddenly.

nd Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover to the LORD God of Israel.
\[2]For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.
\[3]For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people assembled themselves at Jerusalem.
\[4]And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
\[5]So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover to the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done [it] of a long [time in the manner] as it was written.
\[6]So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you that have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.
\[7]And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, [who] therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.
\[8]Now be ye not stiff-necked, as your fathers [were], [but] yield yourselves to the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.
\[9]For if ye turn again to the LORD, your brethren and your children [will find] compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they will return into this land: for the LORD your God [is] gracious and merciful, and will not turn away [his] face from you, if ye return to him.
\[10]So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even to Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
\[11]Nevertheless, divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
\[12]Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.
\[13]And there assembled at Jerusalem many people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.
\[14]And they arose and took away the altars that [were] in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense they took away, and cast [them] into the brook Kidron.
\[15]Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth [day] of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt-offerings into the house of the LORD.
\[16]And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, [which they received] from the hand of the Levites.
\[17]For [there were] many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one [that was] not clean, to sanctify [them] to the LORD.
\[18]For a multitude of the people, [even] many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one,
\[19][That] prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though [he is] not [cleansed] according to the purification of the sanctuary.
\[20]And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
\[21]And the children of Israel [that were] present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, [singing] with loud instruments to the LORD.
\[22]And Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they ate throughout the feast seven days, offering peace-offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.
\[23]And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept [other] seven days with gladness.
\[24]For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
\[25]And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came from the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
\[26]So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel [there was] not the like in Jerusalem.
\[27]Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer ascended to his holy dwelling-place, [even] to heaven.

ow when all this was finished, all Israel [that were] present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned every man to his possession into their own cities.
\[2]And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt-offerings and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.
\[3][He appointed] also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt-offerings, [to wit], for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, and the burnt-offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new-moons, and for the set feasts, as [it is] written in the law of the LORD.
\[4]Moreover, he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.
\[5]And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the first-fruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all [things] they brought in abundantly.
\[6]And the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to the LORD their God, and laid [them] by heaps.
\[7]In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished [them] in the seventh month.
\[8]And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.
\[9]Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
\[10]And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since [the people] began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left [is] this great abundance.
\[11]Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared [them],
\[12]And brought in the offerings and the tithes, and the dedicated [things] faithfully: over which Conaniah the Levite [was] ruler, and Shimei his brother [was] the next.
\[13]And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, [were] overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.
\[14]And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter towards the east, [was] over the free-will-offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.
\[15]And next him [were] Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in [their] set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:
\[16]Besides their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, [even] to every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;

\[18]And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:

\[20]And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and performed [that which was] good and right and truth before the LORD his God.
\[21]And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did [it] with all his heart, and prospered.

fter [these] things, and their establishment, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself.
\[2]And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that he purposed to fight against Jerusalem,
\[3]He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which [were] without the city: and they helped him.
\[4]So there were assembled many people, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?
\[5]Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised [it] up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo [in] the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.
\[6]And he set captains of war over the people, and assembled them to him in the street of the gate of the city, and encouraged them, saying,
\[7]Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that [is] with him: for [there are] more with us than with him:
\[8]With him [is] an arm of flesh; but with us [is] the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
\[9]After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem, (but he [himself laid siege] against Lachish, and all his power with him,) to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah that [were] at Jerusalem, saying,
\[10]Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, On what do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?
\[11]Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\[12]Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?
\[13]Know ye not what I and my fathers have done to all the people of [other] lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of my hand?
\[14]Who [was there] among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?
\[15]Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you in this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom hath been able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?
\[16]And his servants spoke yet [more] against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.
\[17]He wrote also letters to rail at the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of [other] lands have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand.
\[18]Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech to the people of Jerusalem that [were] on the wall, to affright them, and to fill them with consternation; that they might take the city.
\[19]And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, the work of the hands of man.
\[20]And for this [cause] Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.
\[21]And the LORD sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he had come into the house of his god, they that came forth from his own bowels slew him there with the sword.
\[22]Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all [others], and guided them on every side.
\[23]And many brought gifts to the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that from thenceforth he was magnified in the sight of all nations.
\[24]In those days Hezekiah was sick and near to death, and [he] prayed to the LORD: and he spoke to him, and he gave him a sign.
\[25]But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit [done] to him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
\[26]Notwithstanding, Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, [both] he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
\[27]And Hezekiah had very great riches and honor: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels:
\[28]Store-houses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.
\[29]Moreover, he provided for himself cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance in great abundance.
\[30]This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
\[31]But, in [the business of] the embassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was [done] in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all [that was] in his heart.
\[32]Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they [are] written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, [and] in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\[33]And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chief of the sepulchers of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

anasseh [was] twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:
\[2]But did [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, like the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
\[3]For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them.
\[4]Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.
\[5]And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
\[6]And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
\[7]And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
\[8]Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers; provided they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.
\[9]So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, [and] to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.
\[10]And the LORD spoke to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken.
\[11]Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
\[12]And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,
\[13]And prayed to him: and he was entreated by him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he [is] God.
\[14]Now after this, he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish-gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great highth, and put captains of war in all the fortified cities of Judah.
\[15]And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast [them] out of the city.
\[16]And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed on it peace-offerings and thank-offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.
\[17]Nevertheless, the people sacrificed still in the high places, [yet] to the LORD their God only.
\[18]Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they [are written] in the book of the kings of Israel.
\[19]His prayer also, and [how God] was entreated by him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they [are] written among the sayings of the seers.
\[20]So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
\[21]Amon [was] two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.
\[22]But he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed to all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;
\[23]And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.
\[24]And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.
\[25]But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.

osiah [was] eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.
\[2]And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined [neither] to the right hand, nor to the left.
\[3]For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.
\[4]And they broke down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that [were] on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust [of them] and strewed [it] upon the graves of them that had sacrificed to them.
\[5]And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
\[6]And [so did he] in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even to Naphtali, with their mattocks around.
\[7]And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.
\[8]Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.
\[9]And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had collected from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.
\[10]And they put [it] in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and mend the house:
\[11]Even to the artificers and builders they gave [it], to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
\[12]And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them [were] Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to superintend [it]; and [others of] the Levites, all that had skill in instruments of music.
\[13]Also [they were] over the bearers of burdens, and [were] overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites [there were] scribes, and officers, and porters.
\[14]And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of the LORD [given] by Moses.
\[15]And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.
\[16]And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they perform.
\[17]And they have collected the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.
\[18]Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
\[19]And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.
\[20]And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,
\[21]Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel, and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great [is] the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.
\[22]And Hilkiah, and [they] that the king [had appointed], went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spoke to her to that [effect].
\[23]And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me.
\[24]Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon its inhabitants, [even] all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:
\[25]Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.
\[26]And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, so shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel [concerning] the words which thou hast heard;
\[27]Because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou didst hear his words against this place, and against its inhabitants, and didst humble thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard [thee] also, saith the LORD.
\[28]Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thy eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.
\[29]Then the king sent and convened all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
\[30]And the king went into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.
\[31]And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.
\[32]And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin, to stand [to it]. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
\[33]And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that [pertained] to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel, to serve, [even] to serve the LORD their God. [And] all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.

oreover, Josiah kept a passover to the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth [day] of the first month.
\[2]And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,
\[3]And said to the Levites that taught all Israel, who were holy to the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built; [it shall] not [be] a burden upon [your] shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,
\[4]And prepare [yourselves] by the houses of your fathers after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.
\[5]And stand in the holy [place] according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and [after] the division of the families of the Levites.
\[6]So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that [they] may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
\[7]And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover-offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these [were] of the king's substance.
\[8]And his princes gave willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred [small cattle], and three hundred oxen.
\[9]Conaniah also, and Shemaiah, and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jehiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave to the Levites for passover-offerings five thousand [small cattle], and five hundred oxen.
\[10]So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.
\[11]And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled [the blood] from their hands, and the Levites flayed [them].
\[12]And they removed the burnt-offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer to the LORD, as [it is] written in the book of Moses. And so [did they] with the oxen.
\[13]And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the [other] holy [offerings] they boiled in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided [them] speedily among all the people.
\[14]And afterwards they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron [were busied] in offering burnt-offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
\[15]And the singers the sons of Asaph [were] in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters [waited] at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
\[16]So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt-offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.
\[17]And the children of Israel [that were] present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
\[18]And there was no passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[19]In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.
\[20]After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.
\[21]But he sent embassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? [I come] not against thee this day, but against the house with which I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from [meddling with] God, who [is] with me, that he may not destroy thee.
\[22]Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself that he might fight with him, and hearkened not to the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
\[23]And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am severely wounded.
\[24]His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in [one of] the sepulchers of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
\[25]And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women have spoken of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and behold, they [are] written in the lamentations.
\[26]Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to [that which was] written in the law of the LORD,
\[27]And his deeds, first and last, behold, they [are] written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

\[13]And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning to the LORD God of Israel.
\[14]Moreover, all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.
\[15]And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place:
\[16]But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till [there was] no remedy.
\[17]Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave [them] all into his hand.
\[18]And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all [these] he brought to Babylon.
\[19]And they burnt the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its goodly vessels.
\[20]And them that had escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia.

nd when the seventh month had come, and the children of Israel [were] in the cities, the people assembled themselves as one man at Jerusalem.
\[2]Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings on it as [it is] written in the law of Moses the man of God.
\[3]And they set the altar upon its bases; for fear [was] upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt-offerings on it to the LORD, [even] burnt-offerings morning and evening.
\[4]They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as [it is] written, and [offered] the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;
\[5]And afterward [offered] the continual burnt-offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a free-will-offering to the LORD.
\[6]From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt-offerings to the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not [yet] laid.
\[7]They gave money also to the masons, and to the carpenters; and provisions, and drink, and oil, to them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
\[8]Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.
\[9]Then stood Jeshua [with] his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, [with] their sons and their brethren the Levites.
\[10]And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.
\[11]And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks to the LORD; because [he is] good, for his mercy [endureth] for ever towards Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.
\[12]But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, old men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:
\[13]So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of the joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.

ow when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building the temple to the LORD God of Israel;
\[2]Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said to them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye [do]; and we do sacrifice to him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur, who brought us up hither.
\[3]But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said to them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.
\[4]Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,
\[5]And hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
\[6]And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote [to him] an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
\[7]And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions to Artaxerxes king of Persia, and the writing of the letter [was] written in the Syrian language, and interpreted in the Syrian language.
\[8]Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:
\[9]Then [wrote] Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dianites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, [and] the Elamites,
\[10]And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest [that are] on this side of the river, and at such a time.
\[11]This [is] the copy of the letter that they sent to him, [even] to Artaxerxes the king: Thy servants the men on this side of the river, and at such a time.
\[12]Be it known to the king, that the Jews who came from thee to us are come to Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the noxious city, and have set up its walls, and joined the foundations.
\[13]Be it known now to the king, that, if this city shall be built, and the walls set up [again], [then] they will not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and [so] thou wilt endamage the revenue of the kings.
\[14]Now because we have maintenance from [the king's] palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king;
\[15]That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so wilt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city [is] a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.
\[16]We certify the king that, if this city shall be built [again], and its walls set up, by this means thou wilt have no portion on this side of the river.
\[17][Then] the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and [to] Shimshai the scribe, and [to] the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and [to] the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.
\[18]The letter which ye sent to us hath been plainly read before me.
\[19]And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and [that] rebellion and sedition have been made in it.
\[20]There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all [countries] beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid to them.
\[21]Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until [another] commandment shall be given from me.
\[22]Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
\[23]Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter [was] read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.
\[24]Then ceased the work of the house of God which [is] at Jerusalem. So it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.

\[8]Be it known to the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work proceedeth rapidly, and prospereth in their hands.

\[10]We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that [were] the chief of them.
\[11]And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was erected these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and set up.
\[12]But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.
\[13]But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon, [the same] king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.
\[14]And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that [was] in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to [one], whose name [was] Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;
\[15]And said to him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that [is] in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place.
\[16]Then came the same Sheshbazzar, [and] laid the foundation of the house of God which [is] in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and [yet] it is not finished.
\[17]Now therefore, if it [seemeth] good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure-house, which [is] there at Babylon, whether it is [so], that a decree was made by Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.

\[2]And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that [is] in the province of the Medes, a roll, and in it [was] a record thus written:
\[3]In the first year of Cyrus the king, [the same] Cyrus the king made a decree [concerning] the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be built, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations of it be strongly laid; the hight of it sixty cubits, [and] the breadth of it sixty cubits;
\[4][With] three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:
\[5]And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple which [is] at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and brought again to the temple which [is] at Jerusalem, [every one] to its place, and place [them] in the house of God.
\[6]Now [therefore], Tatnai governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who [are] beyond the river, be ye far from thence:
\[7]Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews, and the elders of the Jews, build this house of God in its place.
\[8]Moreover, I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, [even] of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given to these men, that they be not hindered.
\[9]And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt-offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests who [are] at Jerusalem, let it be given to them day by day without fail:
\[10]That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savors to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.
\[11]Also I have made a decree, that whoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged upon it; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.
\[12]And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall attempt to alter and to destroy this house of God which [is] at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.

And they built, and finished [it], according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
\[15]And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
\[16]And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy,
\[17]And offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
\[18]And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, who [is] at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.
\[19]And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth [day] of the first month.
\[20]For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them [were] pure, and [they] killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.

\[14]Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.
\[15]And I assembled them at the river that runneth to Ahava; and there we abode in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.
\[16]Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.
\[17]And I sent them with commandment to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say to Iddo, [and] to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.
\[18]And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;
\[19]And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;
\[20]Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.
\[21]Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
\[22]For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God [is] upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath [is] against all them that forsake him.
\[23]So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated by us.
\[24]Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
\[25]And weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, [even] the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counselors, and his lords, and all Israel [there] present, had offered:
\[26]I even weighed to their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents, [and] of gold a hundred talents;
\[27]Also twenty basins of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.
\[28]And I said to them, Ye [are] holy to the LORD; the vessels [are] holy also; and the silver and the gold [are] a free-will-offering to the LORD God of your fathers.
\[29]Watch ye, and keep [them], until ye weigh [them], before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.
\[30]So the priests and the Levites took the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring [them] to Jerusalem to the house of our God.
\[31]Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth [day] of the first month, to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.
\[32]And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
\[33]Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him [was] Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them [was] Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;
\[34]By number [and] by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.
\[35][Also] the children of those that had been carried away, who had come out of the captivity, offered burnt-offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats [for] a sin-offering: all [this was] a burnt-offering to the LORD.
\[36]And they delivered the king's commissions to the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side of the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.

ow when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, [doing] according to their abominations, [even] of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
\[2]For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of [those] lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.
\[3]And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded.
\[4]Then were assembled to me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat confounded until the evening sacrifice.
\[5]And at the evening sacrifice I arose from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands to the LORD my God,
\[6]And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over [our] head, and our trespass is grown up to the heavens.
\[7]Since the days of our fathers [have] we [been] in a great trespass to this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, [and] our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as [it is] this day.
\[8]And now for a little space grace hath been [shown] from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
\[9]For we [were] bond-men; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations of it, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
\[10]And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,
\[11]Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, to which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.
\[12]Now therefore give not your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave [it] for an inheritance to your children for ever.
\[13]And after all that hath come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities [deserve], and hast given us [such] deliverance as this;
\[14]Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldst thou not be angry with us till thou hadst consumed [us], so that [there should be] no remnant nor escaping?
\[15]O LORD God of Israel, thou [art] righteous: for we having escaped, remain yet, as [it is] this day: behold, we [are] before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.

ow when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled to him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very bitterly.
\[2]And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, [one] of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken foreign wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.
\[3]Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
\[4]Arise; for [this] matter [belongeth] to thee: we also [will be] with thee: be of good courage, and do [it].
\[5]Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. And they swore.
\[6]Then Ezra arose from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and [when] he came thither, he ate no bread, nor drank water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.
\[7]And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should assemble at Jerusalem;
\[8]And that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.
\[9]Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within three days. It [was] the ninth month, and the twentieth [day] of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of [this] matter, and for the great rain.
\[10]And Ezra the priest stood up, and said to them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken foreign wives to increase the trespass of Israel.
\[11]Now therefore make confession to the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the foreign wives.
\[12]Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.
\[13]But the people [are] many, and [it is] a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand abroad, neither [is this] a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.
\[14]Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them who have taken foreign wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and its judges, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter shall be turned from us.
\[15]Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this [matter]: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
\[16]And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, [with] certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by [their] names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
\[17]And they made an end with all the men that had taken foreign wives by the first day of the first month.
\[18]And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken foreign wives: [namely], of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.
\[19]And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and [being] guilty, [they offered] a ram of the flock for their trespass.

he words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,
\[2]That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and [certain] men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
\[3]And they said to me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province [are] in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also [is] broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.
\[4]And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned [certain] days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,
\[5]And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:
\[6]Let thy ear now be attentive, and thy eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.
\[7]We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.
\[8]Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, [If] ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:
\[9]But [if] ye turn to me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you driven to the uttermost part of the heaven, [yet] will I gather them from thence, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen to set my name there.
\[10]Now these [are] thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.
\[11]O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thy ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cup-bearer.

nd it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, [that] wine [was] before him: and I took up the wine, and gave [it] to the king. Now I had not [before] been sad in his presence.
\[2]Wherefore the king said to me, Why [is] thy countenance sad, seeing thou [art] not sick? this [is] nothing but sorrow of heart. Then I was very greatly afraid,
\[3]And said to the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchers, [lieth] waste, and its gates are consumed with fire?
\[4]Then the king said to me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.
\[5]And I said to the king, If it should please the king, and if thy servant hath found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldst send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' sepulchers, that I may build it.
\[6]And the king said to me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
\[7]Moreover, I said to the king, If it should please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah:
\[8]And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which [appertained] to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
\[9]Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.
\[10]When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard [of it], it grieved them exceedingly that there had come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
\[11]So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
\[12]And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I [any] man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither [was there any] beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.
\[13]And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon-well, and to the dung-port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and their gates were consumed with fire.
\[14]Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but [there was] no place for the beast [that was] under me to pass.
\[15]Then I went up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and [so] returned.
\[16]And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told [it] to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.
\[17]Then said I to them, Ye see the distress that we [are] in, how Jerusalem [lieth] waste, and its gates are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we may be no more a reproach.
\[18]Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken to me. And they said, Let us rise and build. So they strengthened their hands for [this] good [work].
\[19]But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard [it], they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What [is] this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?
\[20]Then I answered them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.

ut it came to pass that when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.
\[2]And he spoke before his brethren, and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?
\[3]Now Tobiah the Ammonite [was] by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox should go up, he would even break down their stone wall.
\[4]Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:
\[5]And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked [thee] to anger before the builders.
\[6]So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to the half of it, for the people had a mind to work.
\[7]But it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were set up, [and] that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,
\[8]And conspired all of them together to come [and] to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.
\[9]Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.
\[10]And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and [there is] much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.
\[11]And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.
\[12]And it came to pass, that when the Jews who dwelt by them came, they said to us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return to us [they will be upon you].
\[13]Therefore I set in the lower places behind the wall, [and] on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
\[14]And I looked, and arose, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be ye not afraid of them: remember the Lord [who is] great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
\[15]And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to naught, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one to his work.
\[16]And it came to pass, from that time forth, [that] the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers [were] behind all the house of Judah.
\[17]They who built on the wall, and they that bore burdens, with those that laded, [every one] with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other [hand] held a weapon.
\[18]For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and [so] built. And he that sounded the trumpet [was] by me.
\[19]And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work [is] great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.
\[20]In what place [therefore] ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither to us: our God will fight for us.
\[21]So we labored in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
\[22]Likewise at the same time said I to the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labor in the day.
\[23]So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us put off our clothes, [saving that] every one put them off for washing.

nd there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.
\[2]For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, [are] many: therefore we take up corn [for them], that we may eat, and live.
\[3][Some] also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.
\[4]There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, [and that upon] our lands and vineyards.
\[5]Yet now our flesh [is] as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and [some] of our daughters are brought to bondage [already]: neither [is it] in our power [to redeem them]; for other men have our lands and vineyards.
\[6]And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
\[7]Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact interest, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.
\[8]And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, who were sold to the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold to us? Then they held their peace, and found nothing [to answer].
\[9]Also I said, That [is] not good which ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?
\[10]I likewise, my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.
\[11]Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive-yards, and their houses, also the hundredth [part] of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.
\[12]Then said they, We will restore [them], and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.
\[13]Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.
\[14]Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, [that is], twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.
\[15]But the former governors, that [had been] before me were chargeable to the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yes, even their servants bore rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.
\[16]Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants [were] gathered thither to the work.
\[17]Moreover, [there were] at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, besides those that came to us from among the heathen that [were] about us.
\[18]Now [that] which was prepared [for me] daily [was] one ox [and] six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days an abundance of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I required not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.
\[19]Think upon me, my God, for good, [according] to all that I have done for this people.

\[6]In which [was] written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith [it], [that] thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.
\[7]And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, [There is] a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.
\[8]Then I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thy own heart.
\[9]For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it may not be done. Now therefore, [O God], strengthen my hands.
\[10]Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who [was] shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.
\[11]And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who [is there], that, [being] as I [am], would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.
\[12]And lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
\[13]Therefore [was] he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and [that] they might have [matter] for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
\[14]My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
\[15]So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth [day] of [the month] Elul, in fifty and two days.
\[16]And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard [of it], and all the heathen that [were] about us saw [these things], they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought by our God.
\[17]Moreover, in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came to them.
\[18]For [there were] many in Judah sworn to him, because he [was] the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
\[19]Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. [And] Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.

ow it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
\[2]That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he [was] a faithful man, and feared God above many.
\[3]And I said to them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun shall be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar [them]: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one [to be] over against his house.
\[4]Now the city [was] large and great: but the people in it [were] few, and the houses [were] not built.
\[5]And my God put into my heart to assemble the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them who came up at the first, and found written in it,
\[6]These [are] the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one to his city;
\[7]Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number, [I say], of the men of the people of Israel [was this];

\[41]The children of Pashur, a thousand two hundred and forty seven.
\[42]The children of Harim, a thousand and seventeen.
\[43]The Levites: the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, [and] of the children of Hodevah, seventy four.
\[44]The singers: the children of Asaph, a hundred and forty eight.
\[45]The porters: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, the children of Shobai, a hundred and thirty eight.
\[46]The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hashupha, the children of Tabbaoth,

\[58]The children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel,
\[59]The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon.
\[60]All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, [were] three hundred and ninety two.
\[61]And these [were] they who went up [also] from Tel-mela, Tel-haresha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not show their fathers house, nor their seed, whether they [were] of Israel.
\[62]The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred and forty two.
\[63]And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai, who took [one] of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite for a wife, and was called after their name.
\[64]These sought their register [among] those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.
\[65]And the Tirshatha said to them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there should stand [up] a priest with Urim and Thummim.
\[66]The whole congregation together [was] forty two thousand three hundred and sixty.
\[67]Besides their man-servants and their maid-servants, of whom [there were] seven thousand three hundred and thirty seven: and they had two hundred and forty five singing-men and singing-women.
\[68]Their horses, seven hundred and thirty six: their mules, two hundred and forty five:
\[69][Their] camels, four hundred and thirty five: six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses.
\[70]And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests' garments.
\[71]And [some] of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work, twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver.
\[72]And [that] which the rest of the people gave [was] twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and sixty seven priests' garments.
\[73]So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and [some] of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel [were] in their cities.

nd all the people assembled as one man in the street that [was] before the water-gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel.
\[2]And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.
\[3]And he read therein before the street that [was] before the water-gate from the morning until mid-day, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people [were attentive] to the book of the law.
\[4]And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, [and] Meshullam.
\[5]And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:
\[6]And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshiped the LORD with [their] faces to the ground.
\[7]Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people [stood] in their place.
\[8]So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused [them] to understand the reading.
\[9]And Nehemiah, who [is] the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest, the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said to all the people, This day [is] holy to the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.
\[10]Then he said to them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them for whom nothing is prepared: for [this] day [is] holy to our Lord: neither be ye sad; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.
\[11]So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day [is] holy; neither be ye grieved.
\[12]And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.
\[13]And on the second day were assembled the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.
\[14]And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:
\[15]And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as [it is] written.
\[16]So the people went forth, and brought [them], and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water-gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.
\[17]And all the congregation of them that had returned from the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day, had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.
\[18]Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day [was] a solemn assembly, according to the manner.

ow in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.
\[2]And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
\[3]And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God [one] fourth part of the day; and [another] fourth part they confessed, and worshiped the LORD their God.
\[4]Then stood upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, [and] Chenani, and cried with a loud voice to the LORD their God.
\[5]Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, [and] Pethahiah, said, Stand up [and] bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
\[6]Thou, [even] thou, [art] LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all [things] that [are] in it, the seas, and all that [is] in them, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshipeth thee.
\[7]Thou [art] the LORD the God, who chosest Abram, and broughtest him forth from Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham;
\[8]And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him, to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give [it], [I say], to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou [art] righteous:
\[9]And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;
\[10]And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as [it is] this day.
\[11]And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.
\[12]Moreover, thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way in which they should go.
\[13]Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spokest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:
\[14]And madest known to them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:
\[15]And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.
\[16]But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,
\[17]And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst perform among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou [art] a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.
\[18]Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This [is] thy God that brought thee out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;
\[19]Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go.
\[20]Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.
\[21]Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, [so that] they lacked nothing; their clothes grew not old, and their feet swelled not.
\[22]Moreover, thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.
\[23]Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess [it].
\[24]So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
\[25]And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards and olive-yards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they ate and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.
\[26]Nevertheless, they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets who testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.
\[27]Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried to thee, thou hearedest [them] from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them deliverers, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.
\[28]But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore thou leftest them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned and cried to thee, thou hearedest [them] from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;
\[29]And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again to thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not to thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man doeth, he shall live in them:) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
\[30]Yet many years didst thou forbear over them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore thou gavest them into the hand of the people of the lands.
\[31]Nevertheless, for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou [art] a gracious and merciful God.
\[32]Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.
\[33]But thou [art] just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:
\[34]Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened to thy commandments and thy testimonies, with which thou didst testify against them.
\[35]For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.
\[36]Behold, we [are] servants this day, and [for] the land that thou gavest to our fathers to eat the fruit of it and the good of it, behold, we [are] servants in it:
\[37]And it yieldeth much increase to the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we [are] in great distress.
\[38]And because of all this we make a sure [covenant], and write [it]; and our princes, Levites, [and] priests, set their seals [to it].

\[22]The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem [was] Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micha. Of the sons of Asaph, the singers [were] over the business of the house of God.
\[23]For [it was] the king's commandment concerning them, that a certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day.
\[24]And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah [was] at the king's hand in all matters concerning the people.

\[8]Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, [and] Mattaniah, [who was] over the thanksgiving, he and his brethren.
\[9]Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, [were] over against them in the watches.
\[10]And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada,
\[11]And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.
\[12]And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the fathers: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
\[13]Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
\[14]Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;

\[20]Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;
\[21]Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethaneel.
\[22]The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, [were] recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests, to the reign of Darius the Persian.
\[23]The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, [were] written in the book of the chronicles, even till the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
\[24]And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise [and] to give thanks according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward.
\[25]Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, [were] porters keeping the ward at the threshholds of the gates.
\[26]These [were] in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.
\[27]And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, [with] cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
\[28]And the sons of the singers assembled, both out of the plain country around Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi;
\[29]Also from the house of Gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had built them villages around Jerusalem.
\[30]And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
\[31]Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great [companies of them that gave] thanks, [of which one] went on the right hand upon the wall towards the dung-gate:
\[32]And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
\[33]And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
\[34]Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
\[35]And [certain] of the priests' sons with trumpets; [namely], Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:
\[36]And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.
\[37]And at the fountain-gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water-gate eastward.
\[38]And the other [company of them that gave] thanks went over against [them], and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even to the broad wall;
\[39]And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish-gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even to the sheep-gate: and they stood still in the prison-gate.
\[40]So stood the two [companies of them that gave] thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:
\[41]And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, [and] Hananiah, with trumpets;
\[42]And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah [their] overseer.
\[43]Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
\[44]And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.
\[45]And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, [and] of Solomon his son.
\[46]For in the days of David, and Asaph of old [there were] chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
\[47]And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified [holy things] to the Levites; and the Levites sanctified [them] to the children of Aaron.

n that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever:
\[2]Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Baalam against them, that he should curse them: but our God turned the curse into a blessing.
\[3]Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
\[4]And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, [was] allied to Tobiah:
\[5]And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where formerly they laid the meat-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded [to be given] to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.
\[6]But in all this [time] I was not at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I came to the king, and after certain days I obtained leave of the king:
\[7]And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
\[8]And it grieved me greatly: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.
\[9]Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither I brought again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat-offering and the frankincense.
\[10]And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given [them]: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, had fled every one to his field.
\[11]Then I contended with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? and I assembled them, and set them in their place.
\[12]Then all Judah brought the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries.
\[13]And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them [was] Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were accounted faithful; and their office [was] to distribute to their brethren.
\[14]Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its offices.
\[15]In those days I saw in Judah [some] treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all [manner of] burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified [against them] in the day in which they sold provisions.
\[16]There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
\[17]Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing [is] this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?
\[18]Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
\[19]And it came to pass, that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and I set [some] of my servants at the gates, [that] there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
\[20]So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.
\[21]Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do [so] again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth they came no [more] on the sabbath.
\[22]And I commanded the Levites, that they should cleanse themselves, and [that] they should come [and] keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, [concerning] this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.
\[23]In those days also I saw Jews [that] had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab:
\[24]And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews language, but according to the language of each people.
\[25]And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, [saying], Ye shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters to your sons, or for yourselves.
\[26]Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.
\[27]Shall we then hearken to you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying foreign wives?
\[28]And [one] of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, [was] son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.
\[29]Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.
\[30]Thus I cleansed them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;
\[31]And for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

ow it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this [is] Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Cush, [over] a hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)
\[2][That] in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which [was] in Shushan the palace,
\[3]In the third year of his reign, he made a feast to all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, [being] before him:
\[4]When he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, [even] a hundred and eighty days.
\[5]And when these days had expired, the king made a feast for all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both for great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;
\[6][Where were] white, green, and blue [hangings], fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds [were of] gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black marble.
\[7]And they gave [them] drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.
\[8]And the drinking [was] according to the law; none constrained: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.
\[9]Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women [in] the royal house which [belonged] to king Ahasuerus.
\[10]On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,
\[11]To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the people and the princes her beauty: for she [was] fair to look on.
\[12]But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by [his] chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.
\[13]Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for so [was] the king's manner towards all that knew law and judgment:
\[14]And the next to him [was] Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, [and] Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, [and] who sat the first in the kingdom;)
\[15]What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
\[16]And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that [are] in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
\[17]For [this] deed of the queen will come abroad to all women, so that they will despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.
\[18][Likewise] will the ladies of Persia and Media say this day to all the king's princes, who have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus [will there arise] too much contempt and wrath.
\[19]If it pleaseth the king, let a royal commandment go from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another that is better than she.
\[20]And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.
\[21]And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:
\[22]For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that [it] should be published according to the language of every people.

fter these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
\[2]Then said the king's servants that ministered to him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:
\[3]And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may collect all the fair young virgins to Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, into the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given [them]:
\[4]And let the maiden who pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
\[5][Now] in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name [was] Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjaminite;
\[6]Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
\[7]And he brought up Hadassah, that [is], Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid [was] fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.
\[8]So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree were heard, and when many maidens were assembled at Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also to the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
\[9]And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens [who were] meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids to the best [place] of the house of the women.
\[10]Esther had not showed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not show [it].
\[11]And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.
\[12]Now when every maid's turn had come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, [to wit], six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors, and with [other] things for the purifying of the women;)
\[13]Then thus came [every] maiden to the king; whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women to the king's house.
\[14]In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came in to the king no more, except that the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.
\[15]Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, had come to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her.
\[16]So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which [is] the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
\[17]And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
\[18]Then the king made a great feast to all his princes and his servants, [even] Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.
\[19]And when the virgins were assembled the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.
\[20]Esther had not [yet] showed her kindred, nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther performed the commandment of Mordecai, as when she was brought up with him.
\[21]In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those who kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
\[22]And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told [it] to Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king [of it] in Mordecai's name.
\[23]And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was discovered; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.

fter these things king Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that [were] with him.
\[2]And all the king's servants that [were] in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did [him] reverence.
\[3]Then the king's servants who [were] in the king's gate, said to Mordecai, Why dost thou transgress the king's commandment?
\[4]Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he hearkened not to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he [was] a Jew.
\[5]And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.
\[6]And he scorned to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shown him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that [were] throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, [even] the people of Mordecai.
\[7]In the first month, (that [is], the month Nisan,) in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that [is], the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, [to] the twelfth [month], that [is], the month Adar.
\[8]And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws [are] diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it [is] not for the king's profit to suffer them.
\[9]If it shall please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring [it] into the king's treasuries.
\[10]And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews enemy.
\[11]And the king said to Haman, The silver [is] given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.
\[12]Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded to the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that [were] over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province, according to the writing of it, and [to] every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.
\[13]And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, [even] upon the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which [is] the month Adar, and [to take] the spoil of them for a prey.
\[14]The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province, was published to all people, that they should be ready against that day.
\[15]The posts departed, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.

hen Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;
\[2]And came even before the king's gate: for none [might] enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.
\[3]And in every province whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, [there was] great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
\[4]So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told [it] to her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received [it] not.
\[5]Then called Esther for Hatach, [one] of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it [was], and why it [was].
\[6]So Hatach went forth to Mordecai, to the street of the city, which [was] before the king's gate.
\[7]And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
\[8]Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show [it] to Esther, and to declare [it] to her, and to charge her that she should go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him for her people.
\[9]And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
\[10]Again Esther spoke to Hatach, and gave him commandment to Mordecai;
\[11]All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whoever, whether man or woman, shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not called, [there is] one law of his to put [him] to death, except him to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.
\[12]And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.
\[13]Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the Jews.
\[14]For if thou shalt altogether hold thy peace at this time, [then] will there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house will be destroyed: and who knoweth, whether thou hast come to the kingdom for [such] a time as this?
\[15]Then Esther bade [them] return Mordecai [this answer],
\[16]Go, assemble all the Jews [that are] present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in to the king, which [is] not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish.

ow it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on [her] royal [apparel], and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.
\[2]And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, [that] she obtained favor in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that [was] in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the scepter.
\[3]Then said the king to her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what [is] thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.
\[4]And Esther answered, If [it shall seem] good to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.
\[5]Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
\[6]And the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What [is] thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what [is] thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
\[7]Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request [is]:
\[8]If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it shall please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said.
\[9]Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.
\[10]Nevertheless, Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.
\[11]And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all [the things] in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.
\[12]Haman said moreover, Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow I am invited to her also with the king.
\[13]Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.
\[14]Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends to him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and to-morrow speak thou to the king that Mordecai may be hanged upon it: then go thou in merrily with the king to the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.

\[2]And it was found written, that Mordecai had informed of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
\[3]And the king said, What honor and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered to him, There is nothing done for him.
\[4]And the king said, Who [is] in the court? Now Haman had come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak to the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
\[5]And the king's servants said to him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.
\[6]So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What shall be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?
\[7]And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honor,
\[8]Let the royal apparel be brought which the king [useth] to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:
\[9]And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man whom the king delighteth to honor, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor.
\[10]Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, [and] take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.
\[11]Then Haman took the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor.
\[12]And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.
\[13]And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every [thing] that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife to him, If Mordecai [is] of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou wilt not prevail against him, but wilt surely fall before him.

\[3]Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in thy sight, O king, and if it shall please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:
\[4]For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bond-men and bond-women, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage.
\[5]Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?
\[6]And Esther said, The adversary and enemy [is] this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.
\[7]And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath [went] into the palace-garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.
\[8]Then the king returned out of the palace-garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen upon the bed on which Esther [was]. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.
\[9]And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him upon it.

\[3]And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.
\[4]Then the king held out the golden scepter towards Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,
\[5]And said, If it shall please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing [shall seem] right before the king, and I [am] pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who [are] in all the king's provinces:
\[6]For how can I endure to see the evil that will come to my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
\[7]Then the king Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.
\[8]Write ye also for the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the king's name, and seal [it] with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, no man may reverse.
\[9]Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that [is], the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth [day] of it; and it was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which [are] from India to Cush, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, to every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.
\[10]And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus's name, and sealed [it] with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, [and] riders on mules, camels, [and] young dromedaries:
\[11]In which the king granted the Jews who [were] in every city to assemble, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, [both] little ones and women, and [to take] the spoil of them for a prey,

\[13]The copy of the writing for a commandment, to be given in every province [was] published to all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.

\[15]And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced, and was glad:
\[16]The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honor.
\[17]And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.

ow in the twelfth month, that [is], the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)
\[2]The Jews assembled in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.
\[3]And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.
\[4]For Mordecai [was] great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai became greater and greater.
\[5]Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would to those that hated them.
\[6]And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.
\[7]And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,
\[8]And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
\[9]And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,
\[10]The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, they slew; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.
\[11]On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.
\[12]And the king said to Esther the queen, the Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what [is] thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what [is] thy request further? and it shall be done.
\[13]Then said Esther, If it shall please the king, let it be granted to the Jews who [are] in Shushan to do to-morrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.
\[14]And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.
\[15]For the Jews that [were] in Shushan assembled on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.
\[16]But the other Jews that [were] in the king's provinces assembled, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, (but they laid not their hands on the prey.)
\[17]On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
\[18]But the Jews that [were] at Shushan assembled on the thirteenth [day] of the month, and on the fourteenth of it: and on the fifteenth [day] of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
\[19]Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar [a day of] gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.
\[20]And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews that [were] in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, [both] nigh and far,
\[21]To establish [this] among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,
\[22]As the days in which the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day, that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.
\[23]And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written to them;
\[24]Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that [is], the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;
\[25]But when [Esther] came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
\[26]Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and [of that] which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come to them,
\[27]The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves to them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their [appointed] time every year;
\[28]And [that] these days [should be] remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and [that] these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.
\[29]Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.
\[30]And he sent the letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, [with] words of peace and truth,
\[31]To confirm these days of Purim in their times [appointed], according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.
\[32]And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.

here was a man in the land of Uz, whose name [was] Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and shunned evil.
\[2]And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
\[3]His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
\[4]And his sons went and feasted [in their] houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
\[5]And it was so, when the days of [their] feasting were ended, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings [according] to the number of them all; for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
\[6]Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.
\[7]And the LORD said to Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down upon it.
\[8]And the LORD said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that [there is] none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil?
\[9]Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for naught?
\[10]Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
\[11]But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
\[12]And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he hath [is] in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.
\[13]And there was a day when his sons and his daughters [were] eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
\[14]And there came a messenger to Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:
\[15]And the Sabeans fell [upon them], and took them away; yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.
\[16]While he [was] yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God hath fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.
\[17]While he [was] yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yes, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.
\[18]While he [was] yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters [were] eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
\[19]And behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.
\[20]Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell upon the ground, and worshiped,
\[21]And said, Naked came I from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: The LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.

\[4]And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, even, all that a man hath will he give for his life.
\[5]But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.
\[6]And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, he [is] in thy hand; but save his life.
\[7]So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to his crown.

\[12]And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they raised their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads towards heaven.

\[9]Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it look for light, but [have] none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:

\[22]Who rejoice exceedingly, [and] are glad, when they can find the grave?
\[23][Why is light given] to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?

\[17]In the time when they become warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
\[18]The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.
\[19]The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
\[20]They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.
\[21]For now ye are nothing: ye see [my] casting down, and are afraid.
\[22]Did I say, Bring to me? or Give a reward for me of your substance?
\[23]Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
\[24]Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand in what I have erred.
\[25]How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
\[26]Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, [which are] as wind?
\[27]Yes, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig [a pit] for your friend.
\[28]Now therefore be content, look upon me; for [it is] evident to you if I lie.
\[29]Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yes, return again, my righteousness [is] in it.

\[2]Yes, to what [might] the strength of their hands [profit] me, in whom old age had perished?
\[3]For want and famine [they were] solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
\[4]Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots [for] their food.
\[5]They were driven forth from among [men], (they cried after them, as [after] a thief;)
\[6]To dwell in the clefts of the valleys, [in] caves of the earth, and [in] the rocks.

\[9]And now I am their song, yes, I am their by-word.

\[11]Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.

\[13]They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.
\[14]They came [upon me] as a wide breaking in [of waters]: in the desolation they rolled themselves [upon me].
\[15]Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
\[16]And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
\[17]My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
\[18]By the great force [of my disease] is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
\[19]He hath cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes.
\[20]I cry to thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me [not].
\[21]Thou hast become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
\[22]Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride [upon it], and dissolvest my substance.
\[23]For I know [that] thou wilt bring me [to] death, and [to] the house appointed for all living.
\[24]Yet he will not stretch out [his] hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.
\[25]Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was [not] my soul grieved for the poor?
\[26]When I looked for good, then evil came: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
\[27]My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction came upon me.
\[28]I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, [and] I cried in the congregation.
\[29]I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
\[30]My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.

\[21]If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:
\[22][Then] let my arm fall from my shoulder-blade, and my arm be broken from the bone.
\[23]For destruction [from] God [was] a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
\[24]If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, [Thou art] my confidence;
\[25]If I have rejoiced because my wealth [was] great, and because my hand had gained much;
\[26]If I have beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking [in] brightness;
\[27]And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
\[28]This also [were] an iniquity [to be punished by] the judge: for I should have denied the God [that is] above.
\[29]If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or have lifted up myself when evil found him:
\[30]Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
\[31]If the men of my tabernacle have not said, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.
\[32]The stranger did not lodge in the street: [but] I opened my doors to the traveler.
\[33]If I have covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom:
\[34]Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, [and] went not out of the door?

\[37]I would declare to him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near to him.
\[38]If my land crieth against me, or its furrows likewise complain;

o these three men ceased to answer Job, because he [was] righteous in his own eyes.
\[2]Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
\[3]Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and [yet] had condemned Job.
\[4]Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken because they [were] older than he.
\[5]When Elihu saw that [there was] no answer in the mouth of [these] three men, then his wrath was kindled.
\[6]And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I [am] young, and ye [are] very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not show you my opinion.
\[7]I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
\[8]But [there is] a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
\[9]Great men are not [always] wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.
\[10]Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will show my opinion.
\[11]Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.
\[12]Yes, I attended to you, and behold, [there was] none of you that convinced Job, [or] that answered his words:

\[14]Now he hath not directed [his] words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.
\[15]They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
\[16]When I had waited, (for they spoke not, but stood still, [and] answered no more;)
\[17][I said], I will answer also my part, I also will show my opinion.
\[18]For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
\[19]Behold, my belly [is] as wine [which] hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.
\[20]I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.

\[4]The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
\[5]If thou canst answer me, set [thy words] in order before me, stand up.
\[6]Behold, I [am] according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.

\[17]That he may withdraw man [from his] purpose, and hide pride from man.

\[20]So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty food.
\[21]His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones [that] were not seen stick out.
\[22]Yes, his soul draweth near to the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
\[23]If there is a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man his uprightness:
\[24]Then he is gracious to him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.
\[25]His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he will return to the days of his youth:
\[26]He shall pray to God, and he will be favorable to him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render to man his righteousness.
\[27]He looketh upon men, and [if any] shall say, I have sinned, and perverted [that which was] right, and it profited me not;
\[28]He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
\[29]Lo, all these [things] God often worketh with man,
\[30]To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
\[31]Mark well, O Job, hearken to me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.
\[32]If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.

urthermore Elihu answered and said,
\[2]Hear my words, O ye wise [men]; and give ear to me, ye that have knowledge.
\[3]For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth food.
\[4]Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what [is] good.
\[5]For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.
\[6]Should I lie against my right? my wound [is] incurable without transgression.
\[7]What man [is] like Job, [who] drinketh up scorning like water?
\[8]Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.
\[9]For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
\[10]Therefore hearken to me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, [that he should do] wickedness; and [from] the Almighty, [that he should commit] iniquity.
\[11]For the work of a man he shall render to him, and cause every man to find according to [his] ways.
\[12]Yes, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
\[13]Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
\[14]If he should set his heart upon man, [if] he should gather to himself his spirit and his breath;
\[15]All flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust.
\[16]If now [thou hast] understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.
\[17]Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
\[18][Is it fit] to say to a king, [Thou art] wicked? [and] to princes, [Ye are] ungodly?
\[19][How much less to him] that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all [are] the work of his hands.
\[20]In a moment they shall die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
\[21]For his eyes [are] upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
\[22][There is] no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
\[23]For he will not lay upon man more [than right]; that he should enter into judgment with God.
\[24]He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
\[25]Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth [them] in the night, so that they are destroyed.
\[26]He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
\[27]Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
\[28]So that they cause the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
\[29]When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth [his] face, who then can behold him? whether [it be done] against a nation, or against a man only:
\[30]That the hypocrite may not reign, lest the people should be ensnared.
\[31]Surely it is meet to be said to God, I have borne [chastisement], I will not offend [any more]:
\[32][That which] I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
\[33][Should it be] according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou shalt refuse, or whether thou shalt choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.
\[34]Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken to me.
\[35]Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words [were] without wisdom.
\[36]My desire [is that] Job may be tried to the end, because of [his] answers for wicked men.

\[11]Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?

\[11]If they obey and serve [him], they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.

\[16]Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait [into] a broad place, where [there is] no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table [would be] full of fatness.
\[17]But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold [on thee].
\[18]Because [there is] wrath, [beware] lest he take thee away with [his] stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
\[19]Will he esteem thy riches? [no], not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
\[20]Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.

\[23]Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
\[24]Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.

\[3]Who [is] he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that which I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
\[4]Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will ask of thee, and declare thou to me.
\[5]I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now my eye seeth thee.
\[6]Wherefore I abhor [myself], and repent in dust and ashes.
\[7]And it was [so], that after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me [the thing that is] right, as my servant Job [hath].
\[8]Therefore take to you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you [after your] folly, in that ye have not spoken of me [the thing which is] right, like my servant Job.
\[9]So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite [and] Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.
\[10]And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
\[11]Then came there to him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house: and they condoled with him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an ear-ring of gold.
\[12]So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
\[13]He had also seven sons, and three daughters.
\[14]And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.
\[15]And in all the land were no women found [so] fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
\[16]After this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, [even] four generations.
\[17]So Job died, [being] old and full of days.

\[4]Their sorrows shall be multiplied [that] hasten [after] another [god]: their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take their names into my lips.

\[8]I have set the LORD always before me: because [he is] at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
\[9]Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.

 Prayer of David. Hear the right, O LORD, attend to my cry, give ear to my prayer, [that goeth] not out of feigned lips.
\[2]Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thy eyes behold the things that are equal.
\[3]Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast visited [me] in the night; thou hast tried me, [and] shalt find nothing; I have purposed [that] my mouth shall not transgress.
\[4]Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept [me from] the paths of the destroyer.
\[5]Uphold my goings in thy paths, [that] my footsteps slip not.
\[6]I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thy ear to me, [and hear] my speech.
\[7]Show thy wonderful loving-kindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them who put their trust [in thee] from those that rise up [against them].
\[8]Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shade of thy wings.
\[9]From the wicked that oppress me, [from] my deadly enemies, [who] encompass me,
\[10]They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.
\[11]They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;
\[12]Like as a lion [that] is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
\[13]Arise, O LORD disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, [who is] thy sword:
\[14]From men [who are] thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, [who have] their portion in [this] life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid [treasure]: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their [substance] to their babes.
\[15]As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.

o the chief Musician, [A Psalm] of David, the servant of the LORD, who spoke to the LORD the words of this song in the day [that] the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said, I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.
\[2]The LORD [is] my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, [and] my high tower.
\[3]I will call upon the LORD, [who is worthy] to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies.
\[4]The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.
\[5]The sorrows of hell encompassed me: the snares of death seized me.
\[6]In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, [even] into his ears.
\[7]Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
\[8]There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
\[9]He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness [was] under his feet.
\[10]And he rode upon a cherub, and flew; yes, he flew upon the wings of the wind.
\[11]He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion around him [were] dark waters [and] thick clouds of the skies.
\[12]At the brightness [that was] before him his thick clouds passed, hail [stones] and coals of fire.
\[13]The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail [stones] and coals of fire.
\[14]Yes, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.
\[15]Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were uncovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
\[16]He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
\[17]He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them who hated me: for they were too strong for me.
\[18]They attacked me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.
\[19]He brought me forth also in a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
\[20]The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
\[21]For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
\[22]For all his judgments [were] before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
\[23]I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.
\[24]Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.
\[25]With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt show thyself upright;
\[26]With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt contend.
\[27]For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.
\[28]For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.
\[29]For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.
\[30][As for] God, his way [is] perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he [is] a buckler to all those that trust in him.
\[31]For who [is] God save the LORD? or who [is] a rock save our God?
\[32][It is] God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.
\[33]He maketh my feet like hinds' [feet], and setteth me upon my high places.
\[34]He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms.
\[35]Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath held me up and thy gentleness hath made me great.
\[36]Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
\[37]I have pursued my enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
\[38]I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they have fallen under my feet.
\[39]For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
\[40]Thou hast also given me the necks of my enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.
\[41]They cried, but [there was] none to save [them]: [even] to the LORD, but he answered them not.
\[42]Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
\[43]Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; [and] thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people [whom] I have not known shall serve me.
\[44]As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves to me.
\[45]The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid from their close places.
\[46]The LORD liveth; and blessed [be] my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
\[47][It is] God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.
\[48]He delivereth me from my enemies: yes, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
\[49]Therefore will I give thanks to thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises to thy name.
\[50]He giveth great deliverance to his king; and showeth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for ever.

\[4]And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness [and] righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.

\[9]Kings daughters [were] among thy honorable women: upon thy right hand stood the queen in gold of Ophir.
\[10]Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thy ear; forget also thy own people, and thy father's house;
\[11]So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he [is] thy lord; and worship thou him.
\[12]And the daughter of Tyre [shall be there] with a gift; [even] the rich among the people shall entreat thy favor.
\[13]The king's daughter [is] all glorious within: her clothing [is] of wrought gold.
\[14]She shall be brought to the king in raiment of needle-work: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought to thee.
\[15]With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.
\[16]Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.

\[2]To see thy power and thy glory, so [as] I have seen thee in the sanctuary.
\[3]Because thy loving-kindness [is] better than life, my lips shall praise thee.
\[4]Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.
\[5]My soul shall be satisfied as [with] marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise [thee] with joyful lips:
\[6]When I remember thee upon my bed, [and] meditate on thee in the [night] watches.
\[7]Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
\[8]My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.
\[9]But those [that] seek my soul to destroy [it], shall go into the lower parts of the earth.

\[3]I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: my eyes fail while I wait for my God.
\[4]They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: they that would destroy me, [being] my enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored [that] which I took not away.
\[5]O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.
\[6]Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.
\[7]Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.
\[8]I am become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to my mother's children.
\[9]For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee have fallen upon me.
\[10]When I wept, [and chastened] my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.
\[11]I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.
\[12]They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I [was] the song of the drunkards.
\[13]But as for me, my prayer [is] to thee, O LORD, [in] an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.
\[14]Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
\[15]Let not the water-flood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
\[16]Hear me, O LORD; for thy loving-kindness [is] good: turn to me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
\[17]And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.
\[18]Draw nigh to my soul, [and] redeem it: deliver me because of my enemies.
\[19]Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor: my adversaries [are] all before thee.
\[20]Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked [for some] to take pity, but [there was] none; and for comforters, but I found none.
\[21]They gave me also gall for my food; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
\[22]Let their table become a snare before them: and [that which should have been] for [their] welfare, [let it become] a trap.
\[23]Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.
\[24]Pour out thy indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
\[25]Let their habitation be desolate; [and] let none dwell in their tents.
\[26]For they persecute [him] whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.
\[27]Add iniquity to their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.
\[28]Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.

o the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph. I cried to God with my voice, [even] to God with my voice; and he gave ear to me.
\[2]In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.
\[3]I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
\[4]Thou holdest my eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
\[5]I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
\[6]I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with my own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.
\[7]Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favorable no more?
\[8]Is his mercy wholly gone for ever? doth [his] promise fail for evermore?
\[9]Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
\[10]And I said, This [is] my infirmity: [but I will remember] the years of the right hand of the Most High.
\[11]I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
\[12]I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
\[13]Thy way, O God, [is] in the sanctuary: who [is so] great a God as [our] God!
\[14]Thou [art] the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
\[15]Thou hast with [thy] arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
\[16]The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were disturbed.
\[17]The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thy arrows also went abroad.
\[18]The voice of thy thunder [was] in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
\[19]Thy way [is] in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
\[20]Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

aschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, [to] my law: incline your ear to the words of my mouth.
\[2]I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
\[3]Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
\[4]We will not hide [them] from their children, showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
\[5]For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
\[6]That the generation to come might know [them], [even] the children [who] should be born; [who] should arise and declare [them] to their children:
\[7]That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
\[8]And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation [that] set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
\[9]The children of Ephraim, [being] armed, [and] carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
\[10]They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
\[11]And forgot his works, and his wonders that he had shown them.
\[12]Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, [in] the field of Zoan.
\[13]He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as a heap.
\[14]In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
\[15]He cleaved the rocks in the wilderness, and gave [them] drink as [out of] the great depths.
\[16]He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
\[17]And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the Most High in the wilderness.
\[18]And they tempted God in their heart by asking food for their desire.
\[19]Yes, they spoke against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
\[20]Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
\[21]Therefore the LORD heard [this], and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
\[22]Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
\[23]Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
\[24]And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
\[25]Man ate angels' food: he sent them food to the full.
\[26]He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
\[27]He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
\[28]And he let [it] fall in the midst of their camp, around their habitations.
\[29]So they ate, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
\[30]They were not estranged from their desire: but while their meat [was] yet in their mouths,
\[31]The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen [men] of Israel.
\[32]For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
\[33]Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
\[34]When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God.
\[35]And they remembered that God [was] their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
\[36]Nevertheless they flattered him with their mouth, and they lied to him with their tongues.
\[37]For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.
\[38]But he, [being] full of compassion, forgave [their] iniquity, and destroyed [them] not: yes, many a time he turned his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
\[39]For he remembered that they [were but] flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
\[40]How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, [and] grieve him in the desert!
\[41]Yes, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
\[42]They remembered not his hand, [nor] the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
\[43]How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:
\[44]And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
\[45]He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
\[46]He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.
\[47]He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.
\[48]He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
\[49]He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels [among them].
\[50]He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
\[51]And smote all the first-born in Egypt; the chief of [their] strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
\[52]But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
\[53]And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
\[54]And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, [even to] this mountain, [which] his right hand had purchased.
\[55]He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
\[56]Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
\[57]But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
\[58]For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
\[59]When God heard [this], he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
\[60]So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent [which] he placed among men;
\[61]And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.
\[62]He gave over his people also to the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
\[63]The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
\[64]Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
\[65]Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, [and] like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
\[66]And he smote his enemies in the hinder part: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
\[67]Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
\[68]But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
\[69]And he built his sanctuary like high [palaces], like the earth which he hath established for ever.
\[70]He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheep-folds:
\[71]From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
\[72]So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

 Psalm of Asaph. O God, the heathen have come into thy inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
\[2]The dead bodies of thy servants have they given [to be] food to the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints, to the beasts of the earth.
\[3]Their blood have they shed like water around Jerusalem; and [there was] none to bury [them].
\[4]We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to them that are around us.
\[5]How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
\[6]Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
\[7]For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling-place.
\[8]O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily succor us: for we are brought very low.
\[9]Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.
\[10]Why should the heathen say, Where [is] their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight [by] avenging the blood of thy servants [which is] shed.
\[11]Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
\[12]And render to our neighbors seven-fold into their bosom their reproach, with which they have reproached thee, O Lord.
\[13]So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will show forth thy praise to all generations.

\[2]Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come [and] save us.
\[3]Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
\[4]O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?

\[6]Thou makest us a strife to our neighbors: and our enemies laugh among themselves.
\[7]Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.

\[13]O that my people had hearkened to me, [and] Israel had walked in my ways!
\[14]I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
\[15]The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves to him: and their time should have endured for ever.

\[2]Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou [art] God.
\[3]Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.
\[4]For a thousand years in thy sight [are but] as yesterday when it is past, and [as] a watch in the night.
\[5]Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are [as] a sleep; in the morning [they are] like grass [which] groweth.
\[6]In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
\[7]For we are consumed by thy anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.
\[8]Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret [sins] in the light of thy countenance.
\[9]For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years, as a tale [that is told].
\[10]The days of our years [are] seventy years; and if by reason of strength [they are] eighty years, yet [is] their strength labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
\[11]Who knoweth the power of thy anger? even according to thy fear, [so is] thy wrath.
\[12]So teach [us] to number [our] days, that we may apply our hearts to wisdom.
\[13]Return, O LORD, how long? and repent thou concerning thy servants.
\[14]O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
\[15]Make us glad according to the days [in which] thou hast afflicted us, [and] the years [in which] we have seen evil.
\[16]Let thy work appear to thy servants, and thy glory to their children.
\[17]And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yes, the work of our hands establish thou it.

raise ye the LORD. O give thanks to the LORD; for [he is] good: for his mercy [endureth] for ever.
\[2]Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? [who] can show forth all his praise?
\[3]Blessed [are] they that keep judgment, [and] he that doeth righteousness at all times.
\[4]Remember me, O LORD, with the favor [that thou bearest to] thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;
\[5]That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thy inheritance.
\[6]We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
\[7]Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked [him] at the sea, [even] at the Red sea.
\[8]Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
\[9]He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
\[10]And he saved them from the hand of him that hated [them], and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
\[11]And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
\[12]Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.
\[13]They soon forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel:
\[14]But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
\[15]And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
\[16]They envied Moses also in the camp, [and] Aaron the saint of the LORD.
\[17]The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
\[18]And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
\[19]They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped the molten image.
\[20]Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.
\[21]They forgot God their savior, who had done great things in Egypt;
\[22]Wondrous works in the land of Ham, [and] terrible things by the Red sea.
\[23]Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy [them].
\[24]Yes, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
\[25]But murmured in their tents, [and] hearkened not to the voice of the LORD.
\[26]Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
\[27]To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
\[28]They joined themselves also to Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
\[29]Thus they provoked [him] to anger with their inventions: and the plague broke in upon them.
\[30]Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and [so] the plague was stayed.
\[31]And that was counted to him for righteousness to all generations for ever.
\[32]They angered [him] also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
\[33]Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips.
\[34]They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:
\[35]But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
\[36]And they served their idols: which were a snare to them.
\[37]Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons,
\[38]And shed innocent blood, [even] the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.
\[39]Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went astray with their own inventions.
\[40]Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
\[41]And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
\[42]Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
\[43]Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked [him] with their counsel; and were brought low for their iniquity.
\[44]Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
\[45]And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
\[46]He made them also to be pitied by all those that carried them captives.
\[47]Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks to thy holy name, [and] to triumph in thy praise.
\[48]Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.

 give thanks to the LORD, for [he is] good; for his mercy [endureth] for ever.
\[2]Let the redeemed of the LORD say [so], whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
\[3]And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.
\[4]They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.
\[5]Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
\[6]Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, [and] he delivered them out of their distresses.
\[7]And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
\[8]Oh that [men] would praise the LORD [for] his goodness, and [for] his wonderful works to the children of men!
\[9]For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
\[10]Such as sit in darkness and in the shades of death, [being] bound in affliction and iron;
\[11]Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the Most High:
\[12]Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; they fell down, and [there was] none to help.
\[13]Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, [and] he saved them out of their distresses.
\[14]He brought them out of darkness and the shades of death, and broke their bands asunder.
\[15]Oh that [men] would praise the LORD [for] his goodness, and [for] his wonderful works to the children of men!
\[16]For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron asunder.
\[17]Fools, because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
\[18]Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; and they draw near to the gates of death.
\[19]Then they cry to the LORD in their trouble, he saveth them out of their distresses.
\[20]He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered [them] from their destructions.
\[21]Oh that [men] would praise the LORD [for] his goodness, and [for] his wonderful works to the children of men!
\[22]And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.
\[23]They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business on great waters;
\[24]These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
\[25]For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up its waves.
\[26]They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.
\[27]They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end.
\[28]Then they cry to the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.
\[29]He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves [of the sea] are still.
\[30]Then are they glad because they are quiet; so he bringeth them to their desired haven.
\[31]Oh that [men] would praise the LORD [for] his goodness, and [for] his wonderful works to the children of men!
\[32]Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
\[33]He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the water-springs into dry ground;
\[34]A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell in it.
\[35]He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into water-springs.
\[36]And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;
\[37]And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
\[38]He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
\[39]Again, they are diminished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
\[40]He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, [where there is] no way.
\[41]Yet he setteth the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.
\[42]The righteous shall see [it], and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
\[43]Whoever [is] wise, and will observe these [things], even they shall understand the loving-kindness of the LORD.

o the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
\[2]For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
\[3]They encompassed me also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.
\[4]For my love they are my adversaries: but I [give myself to] prayer.
\[5]And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
\[6]Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.
\[7]When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.
\[8]Let his days be few; [and] let another take his office.
\[9]Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
\[10]Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek [their bread] also out of their desolate places.
\[11]Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let strangers spoil his labor.
\[12]Let there be none to extend mercy to him: neither let there be any to favor his fatherless children.
\[13]Let his posterity be cut off; [and] in the generation following let their name be blotted out.
\[14]Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
\[15]Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
\[16]Because that he remembered not to show mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
\[17]As he loved cursing, so let it come to him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.
\[18]As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
\[19]Let it be to him as the garment [which] covereth him, and for a girdle with which he is girded continually.
\[20][Let] this [be] the reward of my adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.
\[21]But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy [is] good, deliver thou me.
\[22]For I [am] poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
\[23]I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.
\[24]My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.
\[25]I became also a reproach to them: [when] they looked upon me they shook their heads.
\[26]Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:
\[27]That they may know that this [is] thy hand; [that] thou, LORD, hast done it.
\[28]Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.
\[29]Let my adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
\[30]I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yes, I will praise him among the multitude.
\[31]For he will stand at the right hand of the poor, to save [him] from those that condemn his soul.

o the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known [me].
\[2]Thou knowest my down-sitting and my up rising, thou understandest my thought afar off.
\[3]Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted [with] all my ways.
\[4]For [there is] not a word on my tongue, [but] lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.
\[5]Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thy hand upon me.
\[6][Such] knowledge [is] too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot [attain] to it.
\[7]Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
\[8]If I ascend into heaven, thou [art] there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou [art there].
\[9][If] I take the wings of the morning, [and] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
\[10]Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
\[11]If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.
\[12]Yes, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light [are] both alike [to thee].
\[13]For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
\[14]I will praise thee: for I am fearfully [and] wonderfully made: wonderful [are] thy works; and [that] my soul well knoweth.
\[15]My substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret, [and] curiously formed in the lowest parts of the earth.
\[16]Thy eyes saw my substance, yet being imperfect; and in thy book all [my members] were written, [which] in continuance were fashioned, when [as yet there was] none of them.
\[17]How precious also are thy thoughts to me, O God! how great is the sum of them!
\[18][If] I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.
\[19]Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.
\[20]For they speak against thee wickedly, [and] thy enemies take [thy name] in vain.
\[21]Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
\[22]I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them my enemies.
\[23]Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts:
\[24]And see if [there is any] wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.

\[2]To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
\[3]To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
\[4]To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.
\[5]A wise [man] will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain to wise counsels:
\[6]To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
\[7]The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of knowledge: [but] fools despise wisdom and instruction.
\[8]My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
\[9]For they [shalt be] an ornament of grace to thy head, and chains about thy neck.
\[10]My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.
\[11]If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:
\[12]Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:
\[13]We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:
\[14]Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:
\[15]My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:
\[16]For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
\[17]Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
\[18]And they lay wait for their [own] blood; they lurk privily for their [own] lives.
\[19]So [are] the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; [who] taketh away the life of its owners.
\[20]Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:
\[21]She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, [saying],
\[22]How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
\[23]Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit to you, I will make known to you my words.
\[24]Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
\[25]But ye have set at naught all my counsel, and rejected my reproof:
\[26]I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
\[27]When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
\[28]Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
\[29]For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
\[30]They rejected my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
\[31]Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
\[32]For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
\[33]But whoever hearkeneth to me shall dwell in safety, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.

y son, attend to my wisdom, [and] bow thy ear to my understanding:
\[2]That thou mayest regard discretion, and [that] thy lips may keep knowledge.
\[3]For the lips of a strange woman drop [as] a honey-comb, and her mouth [is] smoother than oil:
\[4]But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
\[5]Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
\[6]Lest thou shouldst ponder the path of life, her ways are movable, [that] thou canst not know [them].
\[7]Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.
\[8]Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:
\[9]Lest thou give thy honor to others, and thy years to the cruel:
\[10]Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labors [be] in the house of a stranger;
\[11]And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
\[12]And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
\[13]And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that instructed me!
\[14]I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
\[15]Drink waters out of thy own cistern, and running waters out of thy own well.
\[16]Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, [and] rivers of waters in the streets.
\[17]Let them be only thy own, and not for strangers with thee.
\[18]Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
\[19][Let her be as] the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
\[20]And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
\[21]For the ways of man [are] before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.
\[22]His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sins.
\[23]He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.

y son, if thou art surety for thy friend, [if] thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,
\[2]Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
\[3]Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
\[4]Give not sleep to thy eyes, nor slumber to thy eyelids.
\[5]Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand [of the hunter], and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
\[6]Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:
\[7]Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
\[8]Provideth her provisions in the summer, [and] gathereth her food in the harvest.
\[9]How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
\[10][Yet] a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
\[11]So shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth, and thy want as an armed man.
\[12]A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.
\[13]He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;
\[14]Frowardness [is] in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.
\[15]Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.
\[16]These six [things] doth the LORD hate: yes, seven [are] an abomination to him:
\[17]A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood.
\[18]A heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that are swift in running to mischief,
\[19]A false witness [that] speaketh lies, and him that soweth discord among brethren.
\[20]My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
\[21]Bind them continually upon thy heart, [and] tie them about thy neck.
\[22]When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and [when] thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
\[23]For the commandment [is] a lamp; and the law [is] light; and reproofs of instruction [are] the way of life:
\[24]To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
\[25]Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
\[26]For by means of a lewd woman [a man is brought] to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.
\[27]Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
\[28]Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
\[29]So he that goeth in to his neighbor's wife; whoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.
\[30][Men] do not despise a thief, if he stealeth to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
\[31]But [if] he is found, he shall restore seven-fold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
\[32][But] whoever committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he [that] doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
\[33]A wound and dishonor shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
\[34]For jealousy [is] the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
\[35]He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.

\[4]Say to wisdom, Thou [art] my sister; and call understanding [thy] kinswoman:
\[5]That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger [which] flattereth with her words.
\[6]For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
\[7]And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
\[8]Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house.
\[9]In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
\[10]And behold, there met him a woman [with] the attire of a harlot, and subtil of heart.
\[11](She [is] loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:
\[12]Now [is she] without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)
\[13]So she caught him, and kissed him, [and] with an impudent face said to him,
\[14][I have] peace-offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows.
\[15]Therefore I came forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
\[16]I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved [works], with fine linen of Egypt.
\[17]I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
\[18]Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.
\[19]For the good-man [is] not at home, he is gone a long journey:
\[20]He hath taken a bag of money with him, [and] will come home at the day appointed.
\[21]With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she impelled him.
\[22]He goeth after her quickly, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
\[23]Till a dart striketh through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it [is] for his life.
\[24]Now therefore hearken to me, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.
\[25]Let not thy heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.
\[26]For she hath cast down many wounded: yes, many strong [men] have been slain by her.

\[24]When [there were] no depths, I was brought forth; when [there were] no fountains abounding with water.
\[25]Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth.

\[28]When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:
\[29]When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
\[30]Then I was by him, [as] one brought up [with him]: and I was daily [his] delight, rejoicing always before him;
\[31]Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights [were] with the sons of men.
\[32]Now therefore hearken to me, O ye children: for blessed [are they that] keep my ways.
\[33]Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
\[34]Blessed [is] the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.

\[5]A wise man [is] strong; and a man of knowledge increaseth strength.
\[6]For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counselors [there is] safety.
\[7]Wisdom [is] too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.
\[8]He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.
\[9]The thought of foolishness [is] sin: and the scorner [is] an abomination to men.
\[10][If] thou faintest in the day of adversity, thy strength [is] small.
\[11]If thou forbearest to deliver [them that are] drawn to death, and [those that are] ready to be slain;
\[12]If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider [it]? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth [not] he know [it]? and will [not] he render to [every] man according to his works?
\[13]My son, eat thou honey, because [it is] good; and the honey-comb, [which is] sweet to thy taste:

\[15]Lay not wait, O wicked [man], against the dwelling of the righteous; destroy not his resting-place:
\[16]For a just [man] falleth seven times, and riseth again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.
\[17]Rejoice not when thy enemy falleth, and let not thy heart be glad when he stumbleth:
\[18]Lest the LORD see [it], and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.
\[19]Fret not thyself because of evil [men], neither be thou envious at the wicked;

\[21]My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: [and] meddle not with them that are given to change:
\[22]For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?
\[23]These [things] also [belong] to the wise. [It is] not good to have respect of persons in judgment.

\[2][It is] the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honor of kings [is] to search out a matter.
\[3]The heaven for hight, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings [is] unsearchable.
\[4]Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
\[5]Take away the wicked [from] before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.
\[6]Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great [men]:
\[7]For better [it is] that it be said to thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldst be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thy eyes have seen.
\[8]Go not forth hastily to strive, lest [thou know not] what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbor hath put thee to shame.
\[9]Debate thy cause with thy neighbor [himself]; and reveal not a secret to another:
\[10]Lest he that heareth [it] put thee to shame, and thy infamy turn not away.
\[11]A word fitly spoken [is like] apples of gold in pictures of silver.
\[12][As] an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, [so is] a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.
\[13]As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, [so is] a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.
\[14]Whoever boasteth himself of a false gift [is like] clouds and wind without rain.
\[15]By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.
\[16]Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled with it, and vomit it.
\[17]Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbor's house; lest he be weary of thee, and [so] hate thee.
\[18]A man that beareth false witness against his neighbor [is] a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
\[19]Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble [is like] a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
\[20][As] he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, [and as] vinegar upon nitre; so [is] he that singeth songs to a heavy heart.
\[21]If thy enemy shall hunger, give him bread to eat; and if he shall thirst, give him water to drink:
\[22]For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD will reward thee.
\[23]The north wind driveth away rain: so [doth] an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.
\[24][It is] better to dwell in a corner of the house-top, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.
\[25][As] cold waters to a thirsty soul, so [is] good news from a far country.
\[26]A righteous man falling down before the wicked [is as] a turbid fountain, and a corrupt spring.

\[7]I procured [me] servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:
\[8]I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings, and of the provinces: I procured me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, [as] musical instruments, and of all sorts.
\[9]So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
\[10]And whatever my eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labor: and this was my portion of all my labor.
\[11]Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do: and behold, all [was] vanity and vexation of spirit, and [there was] no profit under the sun.
\[12]And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what [can] the man [do] that cometh after the king? [even] that which hath been already done.
\[13]Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
\[14]The wise man's eyes [are] in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.
\[15]Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also [is] vanity.
\[16]For [there is] no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now [is] in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise [man]? as the fool.
\[17]Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun [is] grievous to me: for all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.
\[18]Yes, I hated all my labor which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it to the man that shall be after me.
\[19]And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise [man] or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labor in which I have labored, and in which I have showed myself wise under the sun. This [is] also vanity.
\[20]Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labor which I took under the sun.
\[21]For there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not labored in it, shall he leave it [for] his portion. This also [is] vanity and a great evil.
\[22]For what hath man of all his labor, and of the vexation of his heart, in which he hath labored under the sun?
\[23]For all his days [are] sorrows, and his labor grief; yes, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.
\[24][There is] nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and [that] he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it [was] from the hand of God.
\[25]For who can eat, or who else can hasten [to it] more than I?
\[26]For [God] giveth to a man who [is] good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth toil, to gather, and to amass, that he may give to [him that is] good before God. This also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.

\[9]What profit hath he that worketh in that in which he laboreth?
\[10]I have seen the labor, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.
\[11]He hath made every [thing] beautiful in its time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.
\[12]I know that [there is] no good in them, but for [a man] to rejoice, and to do good in his life.
\[13]And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labor, it [is] the gift of God.
\[14]I know that, whatever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be added to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth [it], that [men] should fear before him.
\[15]That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.
\[16]And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, [that] wickedness [was] there; and the place of righteousness, [that] iniquity [was] there.
\[17]I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked: for [there is] a time there for every purpose and for every work.
\[18]I said in my heart concerning the state of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
\[19]For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yes, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast: for all [is] vanity.
\[20]All go to one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
\[21]Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?

\[11]Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm [alone]?
\[12]And if one prevaileth against him, two shall withstand him; and a three-fold cord is not quickly broken.

\[3]Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatever pleaseth him.
\[4]Where the word of a king [is], [there is] power: and who may say to him, what doest thou?
\[5]He who keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.

\[10]And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this [is] also vanity.

\[8]If thou knowest not, O thou fairest among women, go forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds tents.

he vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
\[2]Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.
\[3]The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: [but] Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
\[4]Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger, they are gone away backward.
\[5]Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
\[6]From the sole of the foot even to the head [there is] no soundness in [it]; [but] wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.
\[7]Your country [is] desolate, your cities [are] burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and [it is] desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
\[8]And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
\[9]Except the LORD of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom; we should have been like Gomorrah.
\[10]Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.
\[11]To what purpose [is] the multitude of your sacrifices to me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.
\[12]When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?
\[13]Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot endure; [it is] iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
\[14]Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble to me; I am weary to bear [them].
\[15]And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you: yes, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
\[16]Wash ye, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;
\[17]Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
\[18]Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be white as snow, though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
\[19]If ye are willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:
\[20]But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken [it].
\[21]How is the faithful city become a harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.
\[22]Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:
\[23]Thy princes [are] rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come to them.
\[24]Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies:
\[25]And I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:
\[26]And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.
\[27]Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.
\[28]And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners [shall be] together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.
\[29]For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.
\[30]For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.

\[3]And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
\[4]And he will judge among the nations, and will rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
\[5]O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.
\[6]Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they are replenished from the east, and [are] sooth-sayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.

\[8]Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:
\[9]And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.
\[10]Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.
\[11]The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be abased, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
\[12]For the day of the LORD of hosts [shall be] upon every [one that is] proud and lofty, and upon every [one that is] lifted up; and he shall be brought low:

\[8]Woe to them that join house to house, [that] lay field to field, till [there is] no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!
\[9]In my ears [said] the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, [even] great and fair, without inhabitant.
\[10]Yes, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.
\[11]Woe to them that rise early in the morning, [that] they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, [till] wine inflameth them!
\[12]And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.
\[13]Therefore my people have gone into captivity, because [they have] no knowledge: and their honorable men [are] famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.
\[14]Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.
\[15]And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be abased.
\[16]But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.
\[17]Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
\[18]Woe to them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart-rope:
\[19]That say, Let him make speed, [and] hasten his work, that we may see [it]: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know [it]!
\[20]Woe to them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
\[21]Woe to [them that are] wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!
\[22]Woe to [them that are] mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:
\[23]Who justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
\[24]Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, [so] their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
\[25]Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills trembled, and their carcasses [were] torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand [is] stretched out still.
\[26]And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from afar, and will hiss to them from the end of the earth: and behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:
\[27]None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:
\[28]Whose arrows [are] sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:
\[29]Their roaring [shall be] like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yes, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry [it] away safe, and none shall deliver [it].
\[30]And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if [one] looketh to the land, behold darkness [and] sorrow, and the light is darkened in its heavens.

n the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and elevated, and his train filled the temple.
\[2]Above it stood seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
\[3]And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy [is] the LORD of hosts: the whole earth [is] full of his glory.
\[4]And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
\[5]Then said I, Woe [is] me! for I am undone; because I [am] a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.
\[6]Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, [which] he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
\[7]And he laid [it] upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thy iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.
\[8]Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here [am] I; send me.
\[9]And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.
\[10]Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.
\[11]Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities shall be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate;
\[12]And the LORD shall have removed men far away, and [there be] a great forsaking in the midst of the land.
\[13]But yet in it [shall be] a tenth, and [it] shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil-tree, and as an oak whose substance [is] in them, when they cast [their leaves]: [so] the holy seed [shall be] the substance of it.

nd it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, [that] Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up towards Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
\[2]And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.
\[3]Then said the LORD to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;
\[4]And say to him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint-hearted for the two tails of these smoking fire-brands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
\[5]Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,
\[6]Let us go up against Judah, and harass it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, [even] the son of Tabeal:
\[7]Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
\[8]For the head of Syria [is] Damascus, and the head of Damascus [is] Rezin; and within sixty five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.
\[9]And the head of Ephraim [is] Samaria, and the head of Samaria [is] Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.
\[10]Moreover, the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,
\[11]Ask thee a sign from the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the hight above.
\[12]But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.
\[13]And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David? [Is it] a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?
\[14]Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
\[15]Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
\[16]For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken by both her kings.
\[17]The LORD will bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; [even] the king of Assyria.
\[18]And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the LORD will hiss for the fly that [is] in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that [is] in the land of Assyria.
\[19]And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.
\[20]In the same day will the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, [namely], by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.
\[21]And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;
\[22]And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk [that] they shall give, he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.
\[23]And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand pieces of silver, it shall [even] be for briers and thorns.
\[24]With arrows and with bows shall [men] come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.
\[25]And [on] all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.

\[4]For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.

\[7]Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, [even] the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks:
\[8]And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach [even] to the neck; and the extension of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.
\[9]Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.
\[10]Take counsel together, and it shall come to naught; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God [is] with us.
\[11]For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,
\[12]Say ye not, A confederacy, to all [them to] whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.
\[13]Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and [let] him [be] your fear, and [let] him [be] your dread.
\[14]And he will be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a trap and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[15]And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be insnared, and be taken.
\[16]Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
\[17]And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.

\[13]For thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
\[14]I will ascend above the hights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.
\[15]Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.

\[18]All the kings of the nations, [even] all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.

\[20]Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, [and] slain thy people: the seed of evil-doers shall never be renowned.
\[21]Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they may not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.
\[22]For I will arise against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD.
\[23]I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts.

\[29]Rejoice not thou, all Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a basilisk, and his fruit [shall be] a fiery flying serpent.
\[30]And the first-born of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant.
\[31]Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, all Palestina, [art] dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none [shall be] alone in his appointed times.

\[9]With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yes, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments [are] in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.
\[10]Let favor be shown to the wicked, [yet] he will not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness he will deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.
\[11]LORD, [when] thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: [but] they shall see, and be ashamed for [their] envy at the people; yes, the fire of thy enemies shall devour them.

\[13]O LORD our God, [other] lords beside thee have had dominion over us; [but] by thee only will we make mention of thy name.

\[16]LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer [when] thy chastening [was] upon them.

\[18]We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance on the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
\[19]Thy dead [men] shall live, [together with] my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew [is as] the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.
\[20]Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself as it were for a little moment until the indignation shall be overpast.

\[3]The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under feet.
\[4]And the glorious beauty, which [is] on the head of the rich valley, shall be a fading flower, [and] as the early fruit before the summer; which, [when] he that looketh upon it, seeth while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.

\[6]And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.
\[7]But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are overwhelmed with wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble [in] judgment.

\[12]To whom he said, This [is] the rest [with which] ye may cause the weary to rest; and this [is] the refreshing: yet they would not hear.
\[13]But the word of the LORD was to them, precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, [and] there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.

\[15]Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we in agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not reach us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:
\[16]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner [stone], a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.
\[17]Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.
\[18]And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.
\[19]From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only [to] understand the report.
\[20]For the bed is shorter than that [a man] can stretch himself [on it]: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself [in it].
\[21]For the LORD will rise as [on] mount Perazim, he will be wroth as [in] the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.
\[22]Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.
\[23]Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.
\[24]Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground?
\[25]When he hath made even the face of it, doth he not cast abroad the vetches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat, and the appointed barley, and the rye in their place?
\[26]For his God doth instruct him to discretion, [and] doth teach him.

\[12]And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.
\[13]Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near [me] with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precept of men:
\[14]Therefore behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, [even] an astonishing work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise [men] shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent [men] shall be hid.
\[15]Woe to them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?

\[17][Is] it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?
\[18]And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.
\[19]The meek also shall increase [their] joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

\[21]That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of naught.
\[22]Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now become pale.
\[23]But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.

\[11]Withdraw from the way, turn aside from the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.
\[12]Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and lean upon it:
\[13]Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.
\[14]And he shall break it as the breaking of the potter's vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a piece to take fire from the hearth, or to take water out of the pit.

\[18]And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious to you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD [is] a God of judgment: blessed [are] all they that wait for him.
\[19]For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious to thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.
\[20]And [though] the Lord shall give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thy eyes shall see thy teachers:
\[21]And thy ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This [is] the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
\[22]Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a polluted cloth; thou shalt say to it, Be gone from me.

\[25]And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers [and] streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
\[26]Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be seven-fold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.
\[27]Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning [with] his anger, and the burden [of it is] heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:
\[28]And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and [there shall be] a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing [them] to err.
\[29]Ye shall have a song, as in the night, [when] a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come upon the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.

ow it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, [that] Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
\[2]And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem against king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.
\[3]Then came forth to him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.
\[4]And Rabshakeh said to them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence [is] this in which thou trustest?
\[5]I say, [sayest thou] (but [they are but] vain words) [I have] counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
\[6]Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; on which if a man lean, it will enter his hand, and pierce it: so [is] Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.
\[7]But if thou shalt say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: [is it] not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?
\[8]Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou canst on thy part set riders upon them.
\[9]How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
\[10]And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
\[11]Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand [it]: and speak not to us in the Jew's language, in the ears of the people that [are] on the wall.
\[12]But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? [hath he] not [sent me] to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may devour their vilest excretions with you?
\[13]Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jew's language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
\[14]Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he will not be able to deliver you.
\[15]Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, the LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[16]Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make [an agreement] with me [by] a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;
\[17]Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
\[18][Beware] lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\[19]Where [are] the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where [are] the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
\[20]Who [are they] among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
\[21]But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
\[22]Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that [was] over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with [their] clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

nd it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard [it], that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
\[2]And he sent Eliakim, who [was] over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
\[3]And they said to him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day [is] a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and [there is] not strength to bring forth.
\[4]It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up [thy] prayer for the remnant that is left.
\[5]So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
\[6]And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
\[7]Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumor, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
\[8]So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.
\[9]And he heard it said concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard [it], he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
\[10]Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[11]Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
\[12]Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, [as] Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden who [were] in Telassar?
\[13]Where [is] the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?
\[14]And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
\[15]And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD, saying,
\[16]O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest [between] the cherubim, thou [art] the God, [even] thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.
\[17]Incline thy ear, O LORD, and hear; open thy eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to reproach the living God.
\[18]Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,
\[19]And have cast their gods into the fire: for they [were] no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
\[20]Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou [art] the LORD, [even] thou only.
\[21]Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:
\[22]This [is] the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, [and] derided thee; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
\[23]Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed; and against whom hast thou exalted [thy] voice, and lifted thy eyes on high? [even] against the Holy One of Israel.
\[24]By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots have I come up to the hight of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, [and] its choice fir-trees: and I will enter into the hight of its border, [and] the forest of its Carmel.
\[25]I have digged, and drank water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.
\[26]Hast thou not heard long ago, [how] I have done it; [and] of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldst be to lay waste fortified cities [into] ruinous heaps.
\[27]Therefore their inhabitants [were] of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were [as] the grass of the field, and [as] the green herb, [as] the grass on the house-tops, and [as corn] blasted before it is grown up.
\[28]But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
\[29]Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
\[30]And this [shall be] a sign to thee, Ye shall eat [this] year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
\[31]And the remnant that hath escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:
\[32]For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape from mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.
\[33]Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a mound against it.
\[34]By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.
\[35]For I will defend this city, to save it for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\[36]Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they [were] all dead corpses.
\[37]So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
\[38]And it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.

n those days was Hezekiah sick with a mortal disease. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thy house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.
\[2]Then Hezekiah turned his face towards the wall, and prayed to the LORD,
\[3]And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done [that which is] good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
\[4]Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,
\[5]Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years.
\[6]And I will deliver thee and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.
\[7]And this [shall be] a sign to thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;
\[8]Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which hath gone down on the sun-dial of Ahaz ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it had gone down.
\[9]The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered from his sickness:
\[10]I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.
\[11]I said, I shall not see the LORD, [even] the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
\[12]My age hath departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day [even] to night wilt thou make an end of me.
\[13]I reckoned till morning, [that], as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day [even] to night wilt thou make an end of me.
\[14]Like a crane [or] a swallow, so I chattered: I mourned as a dove: my eyes fail [with looking] upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.
\[15]What shall I say? he hath both spoken to me, and himself hath done [it]: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
\[16]O Lord, by these [things men] live, and in all these [things is] the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.
\[17]Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul [delivered it] from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
\[18]For the grave cannot praise thee, death can [not] celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
\[19]The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I [do] this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.
\[20]The LORD [was ready] to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.
\[21]For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay [it] for a plaster upon the boil, and he will recover.
\[22]Hezekiah also had said, What [is] the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?

t that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and had recovered.
\[2]And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not show them.
\[3]Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from whence came they to thee? and Hezekiah said, They have come to me from a far country, [even] from Babylon.
\[4]Then said he, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All that [is] in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.
\[5]Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:
\[6]Behold, the days come, that all that [is] in thy house, and [that] which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.
\[7]And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.

\[22]But this [is] a people robbed and pillaged; [they are] all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison-houses; they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.
\[23]Who among you will give ear to this? [who] will hearken, and hear for the time to come?
\[24]Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient to his law.
\[25]Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire around, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid [it] not to heart.

ut now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called [thee] by thy name; thou [art] mine.
\[2]When thou passest through the waters, I [will be] with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
\[3]For I [am] the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Savior: I gave Egypt [for] thy ransom, Cush and Seba for thee.
\[4]Since thou hast been precious in my sight, thou hast been honorable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.
\[5]Fear not: for I [am] with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;
\[6]I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;
\[7][Even] every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; verily, I have made him.
\[8]Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.
\[9]Let all the nations be collected, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, [It is] truth.
\[10]Ye [are] my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I [am] he: before me there was no god formed, neither shall there be after me.
\[11]I, [even] I, [am] the LORD; and besides me [there is] no savior.
\[12]I have declared, and have saved, and I have shown, when [there was] no strange [god] among you: therefore ye [are] my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I [am] God.
\[13]Yes, before the day [was], I [am] he; and [there is] none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall hinder it?
\[14]Thus saith the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry [is] in the ships.
\[15]I [am] the LORD, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.
\[16]Thus saith the LORD, who maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;
\[17]Who bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.
\[18]Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.
\[19]Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, [and] rivers in the desert.
\[20]The beast of the field shall honor me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, [and] rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.
\[21]This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.
\[22]But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.
\[23]Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt-offerings; neither hast thou honored me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.
\[24]Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thy iniquities.
\[25]I, [even] I, [am] he that blotteth out thy transgressions for my own sake, and will not remember thy sins.
\[26]Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.
\[27]Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.
\[28]Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.

et now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:
\[2]Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, [who] will help thee: Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.
\[3]For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thy offspring:
\[4]And they shall spring up [as] among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.
\[5]One shall say, I [am] the LORD'S; and another shall call [himself] by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe [with] his hand to the LORD, and surname [himself] by the name of Israel.
\[6]Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I [am] the first, and I [am] the last; and besides me [there is] no God.
\[7]And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them show to them.
\[8]Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared [it]? ye [are] even my witnesses. Is there a God besides me? verily [there is] no God; I know not [any].
\[9]They that make a graven image [are] all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they [are] their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.
\[10]Who hath formed a god, or cast a graven image [that] is profitable for nothing?
\[11]Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they [are] of men: let them all be assembled, let them stand up; [yet] they shall fear, [and] they shall be ashamed together.
\[12]The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yes, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.
\[13]The carpenter stretcheth out [his] rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.
\[14]He heweth down cedars for himself, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish [it].
\[15]Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take of it, and warm himself; indeed he kindleth [it], and baketh bread; yes, he maketh a god, and worshipeth [it]; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down to it.
\[16]He burneth part of it in the fire; with part of it he eateth flesh; he roasteth meat, and is satisfied: yes, he warmeth [himself], and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:
\[17]And the residue of it he maketh a god, [even] his graven image: he falleth down to it, and worshipeth [it], and prayeth to it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou [art] my god.
\[18]They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; [and] their hearts, that they cannot understand.
\[19]And none considereth in his heart, neither [is there] knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; I have also baked bread upon its coals; I have roasted flesh, and eaten [it]: and shall I make the residue of it an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?
\[20]He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, [Is there] not a lie in my right hand?
\[21]Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou [art] my servant: I have formed thee; thou [art] my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten by me.
\[22]I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and as a cloud, thy sins: return to me; for I have redeemed thee.
\[23]Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done [it]: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.
\[24]Thus saith the LORD thy Redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, [I am] the LORD that maketh all [things]; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself:
\[25]That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise [men] backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;
\[26]That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up her decayed places:
\[27]That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:
\[28]That saith of Cyrus, [He is] my shepherd, and [he] shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.

\[2]I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut asunder the bars of iron:
\[3]And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, who call [thee] by thy name, [am] the God of Israel.
\[4]For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel my elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me:

\[10]Woe to him that saith to [his] father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?
\[11]Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.
\[12]I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, [even] my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.
\[13]I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.

\[18]For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I [am] the LORD; and [there is] none else.
\[19]I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I have not said to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.
\[20]Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye [that have] escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray to a god [that] cannot save.
\[21]Tell ye, and bring [them] near; yes, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? [who] hath told it from that time? [have] not I the LORD? and [there is] no God else besides me; a just God and a Savior; [there is] none besides me.
\[22]Look to me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I [am] God, and [there is] none else.
\[23]I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth [in] righteousness, and shall not return, That to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.
\[24]Surely, shall [one] say, in the LORD have I righteousness and strength: [even] to him shall [men] come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.

\[3]And said to me, Thou [art] my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.
\[4]Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for naught, and in vain; [yet] surely my judgment [is] with the LORD, and my work with my God.

\[9]That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that [are] in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures [shall be] in all high places.
\[10]They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.

\[17]Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste, shall go forth from thee.
\[18]Lift up thy eyes around, and behold: all these assemble themselves, [and] come to thee. [As] I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them [on thee], as a bride [doeth].
\[19]For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.
\[20]The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thy ears, The place [is] too narrow for me: give place to me that I may dwell.
\[21]Then shalt thou say in thy heart, Who hath begotten these for me, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where [have] they [been]?
\[22]Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in [their] arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon [their] shoulders.
\[23]And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow to thee with [their] face towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.
\[24]Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?
\[25]But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.
\[26]And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD [am] thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

\[3]For the LORD will comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.
\[4]Hearken to me, my people; and give ear to me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.
\[5]My righteousness [is] near; my salvation is gone forth, and my arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on my arm shall they trust.
\[6]Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall become old like a garment, and its inhabitants shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
\[7]Hearken to me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart [is] my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.
\[8]For the moth shall eat them like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.
\[9]Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. [Art] thou not that which hath cut Rahab, [and] wounded the dragon?
\[10][Art] thou not that which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?
\[11]Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing to Zion; and everlasting joy [shall be] upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; sorrow and mourning shall flee away.
\[12]I, [even] I, [am] he that comforteth you: who [art] thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man [that] shall die, and of the son of man [who] shall be made [as] grass;
\[13]And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where [is] the fury of the oppressor?
\[14]The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.
\[15]But I [am] the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts [is] his name.
\[16]And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shade of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, Thou [art] my people.
\[17]Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drank at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drank the dregs of the cup of trembling, [and] wrung [them] out.
\[18][There is] none to guide her among all the sons [whom] she hath brought forth; neither [is there any] that taketh her by the hand of all the sons [that] she hath brought up.
\[19]These two [things] have come to thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?
\[20]Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.
\[21]Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:
\[22]Thus saith thy Lord Jehovah, and thy God [that] pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of trembling, [even] the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:
\[23]But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; who have said to thy soul, Prostrate thyself, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.

\[3]He is despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were [our] faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
\[4]Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.

\[6]All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
\[7]He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.
\[8]He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off from the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.
\[9]And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death: because he had done no violence, neither [was any] deceit in his mouth.

\[11]He shall see of the travail of his soul, [and] shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.

\[12]And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.

\[3]For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath uttered perverseness.
\[4]None calleth for justice, nor [any] pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.
\[5]They hatch cockatrice eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.
\[6]Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works [are] works of iniquity, and the act of violence [is] in their hands.

\[14]And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.

\[16]And he saw that [there was] no man, and wondered that [there was] no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation to him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.
\[17]For he put on righteousness as a breast-plate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance [for] clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke.

\[11]For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.

\[6]And I will tread down the people in my anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.
\[7]I will mention the loving-kindnesses of the LORD, [and] the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness towards the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses.

\[2]I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, which walketh in a way [that is] not good, after their own thoughts;
\[3]A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;
\[4]Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable [things is in] their vessels;
\[5]Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These [are] a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.
\[6]Behold, [it is] written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,
\[7]Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, who have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.
\[8]Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and [one] saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing [is] in it: so will I do for my servants' sake, that I may not destroy them all.
\[9]And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and my elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.
\[10]And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.

\[12]Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spoke, ye did not hear; but did evil before my eyes, and did choose [that] in which I delighted not.
\[13]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:
\[14]Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.
\[15]And ye shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen: for the Lord GOD will slay thee, and call his servants by another name:
\[16]That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.
\[17]For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
\[18]But be ye glad and rejoice for ever [in that] which I create: for behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
\[19]And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
\[20]There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die a hundred years old: but the sinner [being] a hundred years old shall be accursed.

\[22]They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree [are] the days of my people, and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
\[23]They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they [are] the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.
\[24]And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.

Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.
\[4]I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did evil before my eyes, and chose [that] in which I delighted not.

\[8]Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? [or] shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.
\[9]Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut [the womb]? saith thy God.
\[10]Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:
\[11]That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may draw milk, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.
\[12]For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon [her] sides, and be dandled upon [her] knees.
\[13]As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
\[14]And when ye see [this], your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known towards his servants, and [his] indignation towards his enemies.
\[15]For behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
\[16]For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.
\[17]They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one [tree] in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.
\[18]For I [know] their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.
\[19]And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them to the nations, [to] Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, [to] Tubal, and Javan, [to] the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
\[20]And they shall bring all your brethren [for] an offering to the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.
\[21]And I will also take of them for priests [and] for Levites, saith the LORD.
\[22]For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.
\[23]And it shall come to pass, [that] from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.
\[24]And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh.

he words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that [were] in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
\[2]To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
\[3]It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
\[4]Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[5]Before I formed thee in embryo I knew thee; and before thou wast born I sanctified thee, [and] I ordained thee a prophet to the nations.
\[6]Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I [am] a child.
\[7]But the LORD said to me, Say not, I [am] a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatever I command thee thou shalt speak.
\[8]Be not afraid of their faces: for I [am] with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD.
\[9]Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said to me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.
\[10]See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.
\[11]Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Jeremiah, What seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree.
\[12]Then said the LORD to me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.
\[13]And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and its face [is] towards the north.
\[14]Then the LORD said to me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
\[15]For lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls around, and against all the cities of Judah.
\[16]And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.
\[17]Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.
\[18]For behold, I have made thee this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against her princes, against her priests, and against the people of the land.
\[19]And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I [am] with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.

\[2]Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thy espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land [that was] not sown.
\[3]Israel [was] holiness to the LORD, [and] the first-fruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the LORD.
\[4]Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:
\[5]Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they have gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and have become vain?
\[6]Neither said they, Where [is] the LORD that brought us out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drouth, and of the shades of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?
\[7]And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit of it, and the goodness of it; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.
\[8]The priests said not, Where [is] the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after [things that] do not profit.
\[9]Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.
\[10]For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there is such a thing.
\[11]Hath a nation changed [their] gods, which [are] yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for [that which] doth not profit.
\[12]Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD.
\[13]For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, [and] hewed out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
\[14][Is] Israel a servant? [is] he a home-born [slave]? why is he laid waste?
\[15]The young lions roared upon him, [and] yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.
\[16]Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.
\[17]Hast thou not procured this to thyself in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?
\[18]And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?
\[19]Thy own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that [it is] an evil [thing] and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear [is] not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.
\[20]For of old time I have broken thy yoke, [and] burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.
\[21]Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to me?
\[22]For though thou shalt wash thee with niter, and take thee much soap, [yet] thy iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.
\[23]How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: [thou art] a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
\[24]A wild ass used to the wilderness, [that] snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.
\[25]Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.
\[26]As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed: they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,
\[27]Saying to a stock, Thou [art] my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned [their] back to me, and not [their] face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.
\[28]But where [are] thy gods that thou hast made for thyself? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for [according to] the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.
\[29]Why will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the LORD.
\[30]In vain have I smitten your children; they have received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
\[31]O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel? a land of darkness? why say my people, We are lords; we will come no more to thee?
\[32]Can a maid forget her ornaments, [or] a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
\[33]Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.
\[34]Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.
\[35]Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger will turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.
\[36]Why dost thou go about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.
\[37]Yes, thou shalt go forth from him, and thy hands upon thy head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.

\[2]Lift up thy eyes to the high places, and see where thou hast not been lain with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy acts of lewdness, and with thy wickedness.

\[14]Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married to you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:
\[15]And I will give you pastors according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
\[16]And it shall come to pass, when ye shall be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit [it]; neither shall [that] be done any more.
\[17]At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem; neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.
\[18]In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together from the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance to your fathers.
\[19]But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me.
\[20]Surely [as] a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the LORD.

\[22]Return, ye backsliding children, [and] I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come to thee; for thou [art] the LORD our God.
\[23]Truly in vain [is salvation hoped for] from the hills, [and from] the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God [is] the salvation of Israel.
\[24]For shame hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
\[25]We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.

\[5]Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, Gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.
\[6]Set up the standard towards Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.
\[7]The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.
\[8]For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.
\[9]And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, [that] the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.
\[10]Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth to the soul.
\[11]At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness towards the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,
\[12][Even] a full wind from those [places] shall come to me: now also will I give sentence against them.
\[13]Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots [shall be] as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! for we are laid waste.
\[14]O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?
\[15]For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.
\[16]Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, [that] watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.
\[17]As keepers of a field they are against her on all sides; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.
\[18]Thy way and thy doings have procured these [things] to thee; this [is] thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth to thy heart.
\[19]My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.
\[20]Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste; suddenly are my tents ruined, [and] my curtains in a moment.
\[21]How long shall I see the standard, [and] hear the sound of the trumpet?
\[22]For my people [are] foolish, they have not known me; they [are] sottish children, and they have no understanding: they [are] wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
\[23]I beheld the earth, and lo, [it was] without form, and void; and the heavens, and they [had] no light.
\[24]I beheld the mountains, and lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.
\[25]I beheld, and lo, [there was] no man, and all the fowls of the heavens had fled.
\[26]I beheld, and lo, the fruitful place [was] a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of the LORD, [and] by his fierce anger.
\[27]For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.
\[28]For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken [it], I have purposed [it], and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.
\[29]The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city [shall be] forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.
\[30]And [when] thou [art] laid waste, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rendest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair: [thy] lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life.
\[31]For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, [and] the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, [that] bewaileth herself, [that] spreadeth her hands, [saying], Woe [is] me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.

un ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in its broad places, if ye can find a man, if there is [any] that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.
\[2]And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.
\[3]O LORD, [are] not thy eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, [but] they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.
\[4]Therefore I said, Surely these [are] poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, [nor] the judgment of their God.
\[5]I will go to the great men, and will speak to them; for they have known the way of the LORD, [and] the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, [and] burst the bonds.
\[6]Wherefore a lion from the forest shall slay them, [and] a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, [and] their backslidings are increased.
\[7]How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by [them that are] no gods: when I had fed them to the full, then they committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.
\[8]They were [as] fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbor's wife.
\[9]Shall I not visit for these [things]? saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\[10]Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they [are] not the LORD'S.
\[11]For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD.
\[12]They have belied the LORD, and said, [It is] not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:
\[13]And the prophets shall become wind, and the word [is] not in them: thus shall it be done to them.
\[14]Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, Behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
\[15]Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the LORD: it [is] a mighty nation, it [is] an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.
\[16]Their quiver [is] as an open sepulcher, they [are] all mighty men.
\[17]And they shall eat up thy harvest, and thy bread, [which] thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thy herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig-trees: they shall impoverish with the sword thy fortified cities, in which thou hast trusted.
\[18]Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.
\[19]And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Why doeth the LORD our God all these [things] to us? then shalt thou answer them, As ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land [that is] not yours.
\[20]Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,
\[21]Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; who have eyes, and see not; who have ears, and hear not:
\[22]Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, who have placed the sand [for] the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though its waves toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?
\[23]But this people have a revolting and a rebellious heart; they have revolted and gone.
\[24]Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in its season: he reserveth to us the appointed weeks of harvest.
\[25]Your iniquities have turned away these [things], and your sins have withheld good [things] from you.
\[26]For among my people are found wicked [men]: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.
\[27]As a cage is full of birds, so [are] their houses full of deceit: therefore they have become great, and have grown rich.
\[28]They have become fat, they shine: yes, they surpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.
\[29]Shall I not visit for these [things]? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\[30]A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;
\[31]The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love [to have it] so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?

 ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Beth-haccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction.
\[2]I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate [woman].
\[3]The shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall pitch [their] tents against her on every side; they shall feed every one in his place.
\[4]Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! for the day departeth, for the shadows of the evening are lengthened.
\[5]Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
\[6]For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this [is] the city to be visited; she [is] wholly oppression in the midst of her.
\[7]As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and devastation is heard in her; before me continually [are] grief and wounds.
\[8]Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.
\[9]Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thy hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets.
\[10]To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? Behold, their ear [is] uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.
\[11]Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with [him that is] full of days.
\[12]And their houses shall be turned to others, [with their] fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.
\[13]For from the least of them even to the greatest of them every one [is] given to covetousness; and from the prophet even to the priest every one dealeth falsely.
\[14]They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when [there is] no peace.
\[15]Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? no, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time [that] I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.
\[16]Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where [is] the good way, and walk in it, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk [in it].
\[17]Also I set watchmen over you, [saying], Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.
\[18]Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what [is] among them.
\[19]Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, [even] the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened to my words, nor to my law, but have rejected it.
\[20]To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a distant country? your burnt-offerings [are] not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.
\[21]Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.
\[22]Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.
\[23]They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they [are] cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.
\[24]We have heard the fame of it: our hands become feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, [and] pain, as of a woman in travail.
\[25]Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy [and] fear [is] on every side.
\[26]O daughter of my people, gird [thee] with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, [as for] an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.
\[27]I have set thee [for] a tower [and] a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.
\[28]They [are] all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: [they are] brass and iron; they [are] all corrupters.
\[29]The bellows is burned, the lead is consumed by the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.

\[3]Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
\[4]Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, [are] these.
\[5]For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor;
\[6][If] ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:
\[7]Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.
\[8]Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.
\[9]Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;
\[10]And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?
\[11]Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen [it], saith the LORD.
\[12]But go ye now to my place which [was] in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.
\[13]And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I spoke to you, rising early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;
\[14]Therefore will I do to [this] house, which is called by my name, in which ye trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.
\[15]And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, [even] the whole seed of Ephraim.
\[16]Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.
\[17]Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\[18]The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.
\[19]Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: [do they] not [provoke] themselves to the confusion of their own faces?
\[20]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, my anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
\[21]Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt-offerings to your sacrifices, and eat flesh.
\[22]For I spoke not to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices:
\[23]But this thing I commanded them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well to you.
\[24]But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels [and] in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.
\[25]Since the day that your fathers came forth from the land of Egypt to this day I have even sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising early and sending [them]:
\[26]Yet they hearkened not to me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.
\[27]Therefore thou shalt speak all these words to them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call to them; but they will not answer thee.
\[28]But thou shalt say to them, This [is] a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction: truth hath perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
\[29]Cut off thy hair, [O Jerusalem], and cast [it] away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.
\[30]For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.
\[31]And they have built the high places of Tophet, which [is] in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded [them] not, neither came it into my heart.
\[32]Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there shall be no place.
\[33]And the carcasses of this people shall be food for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall frighten [them] away.
\[34]Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.

\[3]And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, who remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts.
\[4]Moreover, thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?
\[5]Why [then] hath this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.
\[6]I hearkened and heard, [but] they spoke not aright: no man repented of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth to the battle.
\[7]Yes, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.

\[9]The wise [men] are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom [is] in them?
\[10]Therefore will I give their wives to others, [and] their fields to them that shall inherit [them]: for every one from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even to the priest every one dealeth falsely.
\[11]For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when [there is] no peace.
\[12]Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? no, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.

\[14]Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.
\[15]We looked for peace, but no good [came]; [and] for a time of health, and behold, trouble!
\[16]The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they have come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.

\[18]And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.
\[19]For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we laid waste! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast [us] out.

\[21]For death hath come up into our windows, [and] hath entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, [and] the young men from the streets.
\[22]Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcasses of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvest-man, and none shall gather [them].

\[2]Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.
\[3]For the customs of the people [are] vain: for [one] cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the ax.
\[4]They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it may not move.
\[5]They [are] upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also [is it] in them to do good.
\[6]Forasmuch as [there is] none like to thee, O LORD; thou [art] great, and thy name [is] great in might.
\[7]Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise [men] of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, [there is] none like to thee.
\[8]But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock [is] a doctrine of vanities.
\[9]Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple [is] their clothing: they [are] all the work of skillful [men].
\[10]But the LORD [is] the true God, he [is] the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.
\[11]Thus shall ye say to them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, [even] they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.
\[12]He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.
\[13]When he uttereth his voice, [there is] a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
\[14]Every man is brutish in [his] knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image [is] falsehood, and [there is] no breath in them.
\[15]They [are] vanity, [and] the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\[16]The portion of Jacob [is] not like them: for he [is] the former of all [things]; and Israel [is] the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts [is] his name.
\[17]Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.
\[18]For thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them that they may find [it so].
\[19]Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this [is] a grief, and I must bear it.
\[20]My tabernacle is laid waste, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone from me, and they [are] not: [there is] none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
\[21]For the pastors have become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.
\[22]Behold, the sound of the noise is come, and a great commotion from the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, [and] a den of dragons.
\[23]O LORD, I know that the way of man [is] not in himself: [it is] not in man that walketh to direct his steps.
\[24]O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thy anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.
\[25]Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.

he word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
\[2]Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
\[3]And say thou to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Cursed [be] the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant,
\[4]Which I commanded your fathers in the day [that] I brought them forth from the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:
\[5]That I may perform the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as [it is] this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.
\[6]Then the LORD said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.
\[7]For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day [that] I brought them out of the land of Egypt, [even] to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.
\[8]Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded [them] to do; but they did [them] not.
\[9]And the LORD said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[10]They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.
\[11]Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry to me, I will not hearken to them.
\[12]Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry to the gods to which they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
\[13]For [according to] the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and [according to] the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to [that] shameful thing, [even] altars to burn incense to Baal.
\[14]Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear [them] in the time when they cry to me for their trouble.
\[15]What hath my beloved to do in my house, [seeing] she hath wrought lewdness with many; and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.
\[16]The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, [and] of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.
\[17]For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense to Baal.
\[18]And the LORD hath given me knowledge [of it], and I know [it]: then thou showedst me their doings.
\[19]But I [was] like a lamb [or] an ox [that] is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, [saying], Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.
\[20]But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for to thee have I revealed my cause.
\[21]Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand:
\[22]Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:
\[23]And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, [even] the year of their visitation.

ighteous [art] thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me speak with thee of [thy] judgments: Why doth the way of the wicked prosper? [why] are they all happy that deal very treacherously?
\[2]Thou hast planted them, yes, they have taken root: they grow, yes, they bring forth fruit: thou [art] near in their mouth, and far from their reins.
\[3]But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried my heart towards thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
\[4]How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He will not see our last end.
\[5]If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and [if] in the land of peace, [in which] thou hast trusted, [they wearied thee], then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?
\[6]For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yes, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words to thee.
\[7]I have forsaken my house, I have left my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
\[8]My heritage is to me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.
\[9]My heritage [is] to me [as] a speckled bird, the birds around [are] against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.
\[10]Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
\[11]They have made it desolate, [and being] desolate it mourneth to me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth [it] to heart.
\[12]The spoilers have come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the [one] end of the land even to the other [end] of the land: no flesh shall have peace.
\[13]They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, [but] shall not profit; and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
\[14]Thus saith the LORD against all my evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.
\[15]And it shall come to pass, after I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
\[16]And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people.
\[17]But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD.

hus saith the LORD to me, Go and get for thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.
\[2]So I procured a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put [it] on my loins.
\[3]And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying,
\[4]Take the girdle that thou hast procured, which [is] upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.
\[5]So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.
\[6]And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said to me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.
\[7]Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.
\[8]Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[9]Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
\[10]This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing.
\[11]For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave to me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be to me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.
\[12]Therefore thou shalt speak to them this word; Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say to thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?
\[13]Then shalt thou say to them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
\[14]And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.
\[15]Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.
\[16]Give glory to the LORD your God, before he shall cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and while ye look for light, he shall turn it into the shades of death, [and] make [it] gross darkness.
\[17]But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for [your] pride; and my eye shall weep bitterly, and run down with tears, because the LORD'S flock is carried away captive.
\[18]Say to the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, [even] the crown of your glory.
\[19]The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open [them]; Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive.
\[20]Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where [is] the flock [that] was given thee, thy beautiful flock?
\[21]What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them [to be] captains, [and] as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?
\[22]And if thou shalt say in thy heart, Why come these things upon me? For the greatness of thy iniquity are thy skirts uncovered, [and] thy heels made bare.
\[23]Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? [then] may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.
\[24]Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness.
\[25]This [is] thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.
\[26]Therefore will I uncover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear.
\[27]I have seen thy adulteries, and thy neighings, the enormity of thy lewdness, [and] thy abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe to thee O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when [shall it] once [be]?

he word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.
\[2]Judah mourneth, and her gates languish; they are black to the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
\[3]And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, [and] found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.
\[4]Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain on the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.
\[5]Yes, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook [it], because there was no grass.
\[6]And the wild asses stood in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes failed, because [there was] no grass.
\[7]O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou [it] for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.
\[8]O the hope of Israel, his Savior in time of trouble, why shouldst thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a way-faring man [that] turneth aside to tarry for a night?
\[9]Why shouldst thou be as a man astonished, as a mighty man [that] cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, [art] in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.
\[10]Thus saith the LORD to this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not restrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.
\[11]Then said the LORD to me, Pray not for this people for [their] good.
\[12]When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
\[13]Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say to them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.
\[14]Then the LORD said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I have not sent them, neither have I commanded them, neither spoken to them: they prophesy to you a false vision and divination, and a thing of naught, and the deceit of their heart.
\[15]Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
\[16]And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, because of the famine, and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.
\[17]Therefore thou shalt say this word to them; Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.
\[18]If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yes, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.
\[19]Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul loathed Zion? Why hast thou smitten us, and [there is] no healing for us? we looked for peace, and [there is] no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!
\[20]We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, [and] the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against thee.
\[21]Do not abhor [us], for thy name's sake; do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.
\[22]Are there [any] among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? [art] not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these [things].

\[2]And it shall come to pass, if they say to thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as [are] for death, to death; and such as [are] for the sword, to the sword; and such as [are] for the famine, to the famine; and such as [are] for the captivity, to the captivity.
\[3]And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.
\[4]And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for [that] which he did in Jerusalem.

\[6]Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.
\[7]And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave [them] of children, I will destroy my people, [since] they return not from their ways.
\[8]Their widows are multiplied to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noon-day: I have caused [him] to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.
\[9]She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath resigned her breath; her sun is gone down while [it was] yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD.
\[10]Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor have men lent to me on usury; [yet] every one of them doth curse me.
\[11]The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to treat thee [well] in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
\[12]Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?
\[13]Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and [that] for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.
\[14]And I will make [thee] to pass with thy enemies into a land [which] thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in my anger, [which] shall burn upon you.
\[15]O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy long-suffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.
\[16]Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.
\[17]I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.
\[18]Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, [which] refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether to me as a liar, [and as] waters [that] fail?
\[19]Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou shalt return, then will I bring thee again, [and] thou shalt stand before me: and if thou shalt separate the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return to thee; but return not thou to them.
\[20]And I will make thee to this people a fortified brazen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I [am] with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.

\[4]They shall die by grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; [but] they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcasses shall be food for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.

\[6]Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall [men] lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:
\[7]Neither shall [men] tear [themselves] for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall [men] give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
\[8]Also thou shalt not go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.
\[9]For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.
\[10]And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt show this people all these words, and they shall say to thee, Why hath the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what [is] our iniquity? or what [is] our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?
\[11]Then shalt thou say to them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshiped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;
\[12]And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken to me:
\[13]Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not, [neither] ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I will not show you favor.
\[14]Therefore behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
\[15]But, The LORD liveth, that brought the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers.
\[16]Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they shall fish them; and afterwards will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.
\[17]For my eyes [are] upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from my eyes.
\[18]And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled my inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable things.
\[19]O LORD, my strength and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come to thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and [things] in which [there is] no profit.
\[20]Shall a man make gods to himself, and they [are] no gods?

\[27]But if ye will not hearken to me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.

\[14]Will [a man] leave the snow of Lebanon [which cometh] from the rock of the field? [or] shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?
\[15]Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways [from] the ancient paths, to walk in paths, [in] a way not cast up;
\[16]To make their land desolate, [and] a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and wag his head.
\[17]I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.
\[18]Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.
\[19]Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.
\[20]Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, [and] to turn away thy wrath from them.
\[21]Therefore deliver their children to the famine, and pour out their [blood] by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and [be] widows; and let their men be put to death; [let] their young men [be] slain by the sword in battle.
\[22]Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.
\[23]Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay [me]: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal [thus] with them in the time of thy anger.

hus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter's earthen bottle, and [take] of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests;
\[2]And go forth to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which [is] by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee,
\[3]And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, which whoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.
\[4]Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it to other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents;
\[5]They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire [for] burnt-offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke [it], neither came [it] into my mind:
\[6]Therefore behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter.
\[7]And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcasses will I give to be food for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
\[8]And I will make this city desolate, and a hissing; every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues.
\[9]And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and distress with which their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall distress them.
\[10]Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee,
\[11]And shalt say to them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as [one] breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury [them] in Tophet, till [there be] no place to bury.
\[12]Thus will I do to this place, saith the LORD, and to its inhabitants, and [even] make this city as Tophet:
\[13]And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink-offerings to other gods.
\[14]Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD'S house; and said to all the people,
\[15]Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.

ow Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who [was] also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.
\[2]Then Pashur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that [were] in the high gate of Benjamin, which [was] by the house of the LORD.
\[3]And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah to him, The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magor-missabib.
\[4]For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thy eyes shall behold [it]: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.
\[5]Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all its labors, and all its precious things, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, who shall pillage them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.
\[6]And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.
\[7]O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me.
\[8]For since I spoke, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach to me, and a derision, daily.
\[9]Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But [his word] was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not [stay].
\[10]For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, [say they], and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, [saying], Perhaps he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.
\[11]But the LORD [is] with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: [their] everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.
\[12]But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, [and] seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for to thee have I opened my cause.
\[13]Sing to the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evil-doers.
\[14]Cursed [be] the day in which I was born: let not the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.
\[15]Cursed [be] the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A male child is born to thee; making him very glad.
\[16]And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noon;
\[17]Because he slew me not at my birth; or that my mother might have been my grave, and she had not been delivered.
\[18]Why was I brought into the world to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?

he word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,
\[2]Inquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; it may be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.
\[3]Then said Jeremiah to them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:
\[4]Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that [are] in your hands, with which ye fight against the king of Babylon, and [against] the Chaldeans, who besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.
\[5]And I myself will fight against you with an out-stretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.
\[6]And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they shall die by a great pestilence.
\[7]And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life; and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.
\[8]And to this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.
\[9]He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey.
\[10]For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
\[11]And concerning the house of the king of Judah, [say], Hear ye the word of the LORD;
\[12]O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver [him that is] made desolate out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench [it], because of the evil of your doings.
\[13]Behold, I [am] against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, [and] rock of the plain, saith the LORD; who say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?

hus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,
\[2]And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter by these gates:
\[3]Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver him that is laid waste out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place.
\[4]For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter, by the gates of this house, kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.
\[5]But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.
\[6]For thus saith the LORD to the king's house of Judah; Thou [art] Gilead to me, [and] the head of Lebanon; [yet] surely I will make thee a wilderness, [and] cities [which] are not inhabited.
\[7]And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast [them] into the fire.
\[8]And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbor, Why hath the LORD done thus to this great city?
\[9]Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshiped other gods, and served them.
\[10]Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: [but] weep bitterly for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.
\[11]For thus saith the LORD concerning Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, who went forth from this place; He shall not return thither any more:
\[12]But he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.
\[13]Woe to him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; [that] useth his neighbor's service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;
\[14]That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and [it is] ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
\[15]Shalt thou reign, because thou closest [thyself] in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, [and] then [it was] well with him?
\[16]He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then [it was] well [with him]: [was] not this to know me? saith the LORD.
\[17]But thy eyes and thy heart [are] only for thy covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do [it].
\[18]Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, [saying], Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, [saying], Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!
\[19]He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
\[20]Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.
\[21]I spoke to thee in thy prosperity; [but] thou saidest, I will not hear. This [hath been] thy manner from thy youth, that thou hast not obeyed my voice.
\[22]The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.
\[23]O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!
\[24][As] I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;
\[25]And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand [of them] whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\[26]And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bore thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.
\[27]But to the land to which they desire to return, thither shall they not return.
\[28][Is] this man Coniah a despised broken idol? [is he] a vessel in which [is] no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?
\[29]O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.

\[2]Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD.
\[3]And I will gather the remnant of my flock from all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.
\[4]And I will set shepherds over them who shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD.
\[5]Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice upon the earth.
\[6]In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell in safety: and this [is] his name by which he shall be called, JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.
\[7]Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD liveth, who brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
\[8]But, the LORD liveth, who brought and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I have driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.
\[9]My heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness.
\[10]For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force [is] not right.
\[11]For both prophet and priest are profane; even in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the LORD.
\[12]Wherefore their way shall be to them as slippery [ways] in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, [even] the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.
\[13]And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.
\[14]I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evil-doers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants of it as Gomorrah.
\[15]Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.
\[16]Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not to the words of the prophets that prophesy to you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, [and] not from the mouth of the LORD.
\[17]They say still to them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say to every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.
\[18]For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard [it]?
\[19]Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.
\[20]The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he shall have executed, and till he shall have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.
\[21]I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.
\[22]But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they would have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
\[23][Am] I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off.
\[24]Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD.
\[25]I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
\[26]How long shall [this] be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yes, [they are] prophets of the deceit of their own heart;
\[27]Who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.
\[28]The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What [is] the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD?
\[29][Is] not my word like a fire? saith the LORD? and like a hammer [that] breaketh the rock in pieces?
\[30]Therefore behold, I [am] against the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbor.
\[31]Behold, I [am] against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.
\[32]Behold, I [am] against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD.
\[33]And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What [is] the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say to them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD.
\[34]And [as for] the prophet, and the priest, and the people that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house.
\[35]Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken?
\[36]And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.
\[37]Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken?
\[38]But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD; Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent to you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD;
\[39]Therefore behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave to you and your fathers, [and cast you] out of my presence:

\[2]One basket [had] very good figs, [even] like the figs [that are] first ripe: and the other basket [had] very poor figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.

\[9]And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for [their] hurt, [to be] a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.

\[3]From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even to this day, that [is] the three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD hath come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.
\[4]And the LORD hath sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending [them]; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear.
\[5]They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given to you and to your fathers for ever and ever:
\[6]And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.
\[7]Yet ye have not hearkened to me, saith the LORD; that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.
\[8]Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard my words,
\[9]Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations around, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.
\[10]Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.
\[11]And this whole land shall be a desolation, [and] an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
\[12]And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, [that] I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.
\[13]And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, [even] all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.
\[14]For many nations and great kings shall reduce them to subjection also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.
\[15]For thus saith the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.
\[16]And they shall drink, and be moved, and enraged, because of the sword that I will send among them.
\[17]Then I took the cup at the LORD'S hand, and made all the nations to drink, to whom the LORD had sent me:
\[18][To wit], Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and her kings, and her princes, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse; as [it is] this day;
\[19]Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;
\[20]And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,
\[21]Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,

\[25]And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,
\[26]And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which [are] upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
\[27]Therefore thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and vomit, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.
\[28]And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, then shalt thou say to them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink.
\[29]For lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts.
\[30]Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say to them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread [the grapes], against all the inhabitants of the earth.
\[31]A noise shall come [even] to the ends of the earth; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them [that are] wicked to the sword, saith the LORD.
\[32]Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised from the borders of the earth.
\[33]And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from [one] end of the earth even to the [other] end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.
\[34]Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves [in the ashes], ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.
\[35]And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.
\[36]A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and a howling of the principal of the flock, [shall be heard]: for the LORD hath laid waste their pasture.
\[37]And the peaceable habitations are cut down, because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
\[38]He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.

n the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,
\[2]Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD'S house, and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD'S house, all the words that I command thee to speak to them; diminish not a word:
\[3]It may be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent of the evil, which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings.
\[4]And thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the LORD, If ye will not hearken to me to walk in my law, which I have set before you,
\[5]To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I have sent to you, both rising early, and sending [them], but ye have not hearkened;
\[6]Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
\[7]So the priests and the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
\[8]Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded [him] to speak to all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.
\[9]Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah, in the house of the LORD.
\[10]When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S [house].
\[11]Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the people, saying, This man [is] worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.
\[12]Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes, and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.
\[13]Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.
\[14]As for me, behold, I [am] in your hand: do with me as it seemeth good and meet to you.
\[15]But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye will surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, upon this city, and upon its inhabitants: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.
\[16]Then said the princes and all the people to the priests and to the prophets; This man [is] not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.
\[17]Then arose certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,
\[18]Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed [like] a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.
\[19]Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? did he not fear the LORD, and beseech the LORD, and the LORD repented of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.
\[20]And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:
\[21]And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;
\[22]And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, [namely], Elnathan the son of Achbor, and [certain] men with him into Egypt.
\[23]And they brought forth Urijah from Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
\[24]Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.

n the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, came this word to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
\[2]Thus saith the LORD to me; Make for thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck,
\[3]And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;
\[4]And command them to say to their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to your masters;
\[5]I have made the earth, the man and the beast that [are] upon the ground, by my great power and by my out-stretched arm, and have given it to whom it seemed meet to me.
\[6]And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.
\[7]And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land shall come: and then many nations and great kings shall bring him into subjection.
\[8]And it shall come to pass, [that] the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.
\[9]Therefore hearken ye not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:
\[10]For they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.
\[11]But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell in it.
\[12]I spoke also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
\[13]Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
\[14]Therefore hearken not to the words of the prophets that speak to you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie to you.
\[15]For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy to you.
\[16]Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD'S house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie to you.
\[17]Hearken not to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: why should this city be laid waste?
\[18]But if they [are] prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and [in] the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.
\[19]For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city,
\[20]Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
\[21]Yes, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain [in] the house of the LORD, and [in] the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;
\[22]They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.

nd it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, [and] in the fifth month, [that] Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, who [was] of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests, and of all the people, saying,
\[2]Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
\[3]Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD'S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon:
\[4]And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
\[5]Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD,
\[6]Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD'S house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.
\[7]Nevertheless, now hear thou this word that I speak in thy ears, and in the ears of all the people:
\[8]The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
\[9]The prophet who prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, [then] shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him.
\[10]Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and broke it.
\[11]And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
\[12]Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
\[13]Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.
\[14]For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.
\[15]Then said the prophet Jeremiah to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.
\[16]Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD.
\[17]So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.

ow these [are] the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders who were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;
\[2](After Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, had departed from Jerusalem;)
\[3]By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,
\[4]Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon;
\[5]Build ye houses, and dwell [in them]; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;
\[6]Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished.
\[7]And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray to the LORD for it: for in the peace of it ye shall have peace.
\[8]For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that [are] in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.
\[9]For they prophesy falsely to you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD.
\[10]For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years shall be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word towards you, in causing you to return to this place.
\[11]For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.
\[12]Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray to me, and I will hearken to you.
\[13]And ye shall seek me, and find [me], when ye shall search for me with all your heart.
\[14]And I will be found by you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD: and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.
\[15]Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised up for us prophets in Babylon;
\[16][Know] that thus saith the LORD concerning the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people that dwelleth in this city, [and] concerning your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;
\[17]Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.
\[18]And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them:
\[19]Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent to them by my servants the prophets, rising early and sending [them]; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.
\[20]Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:
\[21]Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;
\[22]And concerning them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah who [are] in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;
\[23]Because they have committed villainy in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbor's wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and [am] a witness, saith the LORD.
\[24][Thus] shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,
\[25]Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name to all the people that [are] at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
\[26]The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man [that is] mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.
\[27]Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, who maketh himself a prophet to you?
\[28]For therefore he sent to us [in] Babylon, saying, This [captivity is] long: build ye houses, and dwell [in them]; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
\[29]And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
\[30]Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying,
\[31]Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because Shemaiah hath prophesied to you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:
\[32]Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.

he word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
\[2]Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write for thee all the words that I have spoken to thee in a book.
\[3]For lo, the days come, saith the LORD; that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
\[4]And these [are] the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
\[5]For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.
\[6]Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? Why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
\[7]Alas! for that day [is] great, so that none [is] like it: it [is] even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.
\[8]For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, [that] I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more bring him into subjection:
\[9]But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.
\[10]Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and quiet, and none shall make [him] afraid.
\[11]For I [am] with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.
\[12]For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise [is] incurable, [and] thy wound [is] grievous.
\[13][There is] none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.
\[14]All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisements of a cruel one, for the multitude of thy iniquity; [because] thy sins were increased.
\[15]Why criest thou for thy affliction? thy sorrow [is] incurable for the multitude of thy iniquity: [because] thy sins were increased, I have done these things to thee.
\[16]Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thy adversaries, every one of them shall go into captivity; and they that plunder thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.
\[17]For I will restore health to thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, [saying], This [is] Zion, whom no man seeketh after.
\[18]Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwelling places; and the city shall be built upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after its manner.
\[19]And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
\[20]Their children also shall be as in former time, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.
\[21]And their nobles shall be from themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach time: for who [is] this that engaged his heart to approach to me? saith the LORD.
\[22]And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
\[23]Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.
\[24]The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he hath done [it], and until he hath performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.

t the same time, saith the LORD, I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.
\[2]Thus saith the LORD, The people [who were] left by the sword found grace in the wilderness; [even] Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.
\[3]The LORD appeared of old to me, [saying], I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee.
\[4]Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel; thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.
\[5]Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat [them] as common things.
\[6]For there shall be a day, [that] the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion to the LORD our God.
\[7]For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.
\[8]Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the borders of the earth, [and] with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither.
\[9]They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim [is] my first-born.
\[10]Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare [it] in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd [doth] his flock.
\[11]For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of [him that was] stronger than he.
\[12]Therefore they shall come and sing in the hight of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.
\[13]Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
\[14]And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD.
\[15]Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, [and] bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they [were] not.
\[16]Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thy eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.
\[17]And there is hope in thy end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border.
\[18]I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself [thus]; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed [to the yoke]: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou [art] the LORD my God.
\[19]Surely after I was turned, I repented; and after I was instructed, I smote upon [my] thigh: I was ashamed, and even confounded, because I bore the reproach of my youth.
\[20][Is] Ephraim my dear son? [is he] a pleasant child? for since I spoke against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD.
\[21]Set thee up way-marks, make thee high heaps: set thy heart towards the highway, [even] the way [which] thou wentest; turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.
\[22]How long wilt thou wander about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.
\[23]Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in her cities, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O habitation of justice, mountain of holiness.
\[24]And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all her cities together, husbandmen, and they [that] go forth with flocks.
\[25]For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.
\[26]Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet to me.
\[27]Behold, the days come saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.
\[28]And it shall come to pass, [that] as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build and to plant, saith the LORD.
\[29]In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.
\[30]But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.
\[31]Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
\[32]Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day [that] I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they broke, although I was a husband to them, saith the LORD:
\[33]But this [shall be] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.
\[34]And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
\[35]Thus saith the LORD, who giveth the sun for a light by day, [and] the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who divideth the sea when its waves roar; The LORD of hosts [is] his name:
\[36]If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, [then] the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.
\[37]Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.
\[38]Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel to the gate of the corner.
\[39]And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.
\[40]And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields to the brook of Kidron, to the corner of the horse-gate towards the east, [shall be] holy to the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.

he word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which [was] the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
\[2]For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the court of the prison, which [was] in the king of Judah's house.
\[3]For Zedekiah king of Judah had confined him, saying, Why dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
\[4]And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;
\[5]And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.
\[6]And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[7]Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thy uncle shall come to thee, saying, Buy for thee my field that [is] in Anathoth: for the right of redemption [is] thine to buy [it].
\[8]So Hanameel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison, according to the word of the LORD, and said to me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that [is] in Anathoth, which [is] in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance [is] thine, and the redemption [is] thine; buy [it] for thyself. Then I knew that this [was] the word of the LORD.
\[9]And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that [was] in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, [even] seventeen shekels of silver.
\[10]And I subscribed the contract, and sealed [it], and took witnesses, and weighed [him] the money in the balances.
\[11]So I took the evidence of the purchase, [both] that which was sealed [according] to the law and custom, and that which was open:
\[12]And I gave the evidence of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel my uncle's [son], and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.
\[13]And I charged Baruch before them, saying,
\[14]Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both that which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.
\[15]For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.
\[16]Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying,
\[17]Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and out-stretched arm, [and] there is nothing too hard for thee:
\[18]Thou showest loving-kindness to thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, JEHOVAH of hosts, [is] his name,
\[19]Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thy eyes [are] open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:
\[20]Who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, [even] to this day, and in Israel, and among [other] men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day;
\[21]And hast brought forth thy people Israel from the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an out-stretched arm, and with great terror;
\[22]And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
\[23]And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:
\[24]Behold the mounts, they are come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and behold, thou seest [it].
\[25]And thou hast said to me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\[26]Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying,
\[27]Behold, I [am] the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?
\[28]Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:
\[29]And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink-offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.
\[30]For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done evil only before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD.
\[31]For this city hath been to me [as] a provocation of my anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before my face,
\[32]Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[33]And they have turned to me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising early and teaching [them], yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.
\[34]But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.
\[35]And they built the high places of Baal, which [are] in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through [the fire] to Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
\[36]And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, of which ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;
\[37]Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in my anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell in safety.
\[38]And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:
\[39]And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:
\[40]And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.
\[41]Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
\[42]For thus saith the LORD; As I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.
\[43]And fields shall be bought in this land, of which ye say, [It is] desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\[44]Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal [them], and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD.

oreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet confined in the court of the prison, saying,
\[2]Thus saith the LORD the maker of this, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD [is] his name;
\[3]Call to me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.
\[4]For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;
\[5]They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but [it is] to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in my anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.
\[6]Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth.
\[7]And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.
\[8]And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, by which they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, by which they have sinned, and by which they have transgressed against me.
\[9]And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise, and an honor before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure to it.
\[10]Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye say [shall be] desolate without man and without beast, [even] in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,
\[11]The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD [is] good; for his mercy [endureth] for ever: [and] of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD.
\[12]Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all its cities, shall be a habitation of shepherds causing [their] flocks to lie down.
\[13]In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that counteth [them], saith the LORD.
\[14]Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.
\[15]In those days, and at that time, will I cause the branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.
\[16]In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell in safety: and this [is the name] by which she shall be called, JEHOVAH our righteousness.
\[17]For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;
\[18]Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt-offerings, and to kindle meat-offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.
\[19]And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
\[20]Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, so that there should not be day and night in their season;
\[21][Then] also may my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
\[22]As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister to me.
\[23]Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
\[24]Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.
\[25]Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant [is] not with day and night, [and if] I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;
\[26]Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, [so] that I will not take [any] of his seed [to be] rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.

he word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people fought against Jerusalem, and against all its cities, saying,
\[2]Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:
\[3]And thou shalt not escape from his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thy eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.
\[4]Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD concerning thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:
\[5][But] thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings who were before thee, so shall they burn [odors] for thee; and they will lament thee, [saying], Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.
\[6]Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,
\[7]When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these fortified cities remained of the cities of Judah.
\[8][This is] the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who [were] at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;
\[9]That every man should liberate his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant, [being] a Hebrew or a Hebrewess; that none should retain them in service, [to wit], a Jew his brother.
\[10]Now when all the princes, and all the people who had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should liberate his man-servant, and every one his maid-servant, that none should retain them in service any more, then they obeyed, and let [them] go.
\[11]But afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had liberated, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.
\[12]Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
\[13]Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth from the land of Egypt, out of the house of bond-men, saying,
\[14]At the end of seven years dismiss ye every man his brother a Hebrew, who hath been sold to thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not to me, neither inclined their ear.
\[15]And ye had now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:
\[16]But ye turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.
\[17]Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened to me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.
\[18]And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in two, and passed between the parts of it,
\[19]The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf;
\[20]I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for food to the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.
\[21]And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes I will give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.
\[22]Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.

he word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,
\[2]Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.
\[3]Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;
\[4]And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, who [was] by the chamber of the princes, which [was] above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:
\[5]And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said to them, Drink ye wine.
\[6]But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, [neither] ye, nor your sons for ever:
\[7]Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have [any]: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye [are] strangers.
\[8]Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;
\[9]Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:
\[10]But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
\[11]But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.
\[12]Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying,
\[13]Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD.
\[14]The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for to this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not to me.
\[15]I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending [them], saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened to me.
\[16]Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened to me:
\[17]Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard; and I have called to them, but they have not answered.
\[18]And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he hath commanded you:
\[19]Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.

nd it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, [that] this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
\[2]Take thee a roll of a book, and write in it all the words that I have spoken to thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to thee, from the days of Josiah, even to this day.
\[3]It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
\[4]Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken to him, upon a roll of a book.
\[5]And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I [am] confined, I cannot go into the house of the LORD:
\[6]Therefore go thou and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD'S house upon the day of fasting: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.
\[7]It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great [is] the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people.
\[8]And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD'S house.
\[9]And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, [that] they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem.
\[10]Then Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S house, in the ears of all the people.
\[11]When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,
\[12]Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and lo, all the princes sat there, [even] Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.
\[13]Then Michaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.
\[14]Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take in thy hand the roll in which thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came to them.
\[15]And they said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read [it] in their ears.
\[16]Now it came to pass when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and another, and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.
\[17]And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?
\[18]Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote [them] with ink in the book.
\[19]Then said the princes to Baruch, Go, hide thyself, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye are.
\[20]And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.
\[21]So the king sent Jehudi to bring the roll: and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama, the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king.
\[22]Now the king sat in the winter-house in the ninth month: and [there was a fire] on the hearth burning before him.
\[23]And it came to pass, [that] when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the scribe's pen-knife, and cast [it] into the fire that [was] on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that [was] on the hearth.
\[24]Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, [neither] the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.
\[25]Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.
\[26]But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.
\[27]Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
\[28]Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah hath burned.
\[29]And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?
\[30]Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.
\[31]And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.
\[32]Then Jeremiah took another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were besides added to them many like words.

nd king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.
\[2]But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, hearkened to the words of the LORD, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.
\[3]And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to the LORD our God for us.
\[4]Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.
\[5]Then Pharaoh's army had come from Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.
\[6]Then came the word of the LORD to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
\[7]Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you to me to inquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which hath come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.
\[8]And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.
\[9]Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans will surely depart from us: for they will not depart.
\[10]For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained [but] wounded men among them, [yet] would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.
\[11]And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,
\[12]Then Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.
\[13]And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward [was] there, whose name [was] Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.
\[14]Then said Jeremiah, [It is] false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.
\[15]Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and beat him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.
\[16]When Jeremiah had entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;
\[17]Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there [any] word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.
\[18]Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, In what have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?
\[19]Where [are] now your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?
\[20]Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
\[21]Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the baker's street, until all the bread in the city should be consumed. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

hen Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying,
\[2]Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.
\[3]Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.
\[4]Therefore the princes said to the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
\[5]Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he [is] in your hand: for the king [is] not [he that] can do [any] thing against you.
\[6]Then they took Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that [was] in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon [there was] no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.
\[7]Now when Ebed-melech the Cushite, one of the eunuchs who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;
\[8]Ebed-melech went out of the king's house, and spoke to the king, saying,
\[9]My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die by hunger in the place where he is: for [there is] no more bread in the city.
\[10]Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dieth.
\[11]So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old decayed rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
\[12]And Ebed-melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, Put now [these] old cast clouts and decayed rags under thy arm-holes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.
\[13]So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
\[14]Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that [is] in the house of the LORD: and the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.
\[15]Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare [it] to thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken to me?
\[16]So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, [As] the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.
\[17]Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house:
\[18]But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape from their hand.
\[19]And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that have fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.
\[20]But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver [thee]. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak to thee: so it shall be well to thee, and thy soul shall live.
\[21]But if thou shalt refuse to go forth, this [is] the word that the LORD hath shown me:
\[22]And behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house [shall be] brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those [women] shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, [and] they are turned away back.
\[23]So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.
\[24]Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.
\[25]But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come to thee, and say to thee, Declare to us now what thou hast said to the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said to thee:
\[26]Then thou shalt say to them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.
\[27]Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.
\[28]So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was [there] when Jerusalem was taken.

n the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.
\[2][And] in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth [day] of the month, the city was broken up.
\[3]And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, [even] Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.
\[4]And it came to pass, when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.
\[5]But the Chaldeans' army pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.
\[6]Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.
\[7]Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.
\[8]And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
\[9]Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.
\[10]But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
\[11]Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying,
\[12]Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do to him even as he shall say to thee.
\[13]So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;
\[14]Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.
\[15]Now the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, while he was confined in the court of the prison, saying,
\[16]Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be [accomplished] in that day before thee.
\[17]But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou [art] afraid.
\[18]For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey to thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.

he word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away captive to Babylon.
\[2]And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.
\[3]Now the LORD hath brought [it], and done according as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.
\[4]And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which [were] upon thy hand. If it seemeth good to thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well to thee: but if it seemeth ill to thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land [is] before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.
\[5]Now while he had not yet gone back, [he said], Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wherever it seemeth convenient to thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him provisions and a reward, and let him go.
\[6]Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.
\[7]Now when all the captains of the forces who [were] in the fields, [even] they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;
\[8]Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
\[9]And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
\[10]As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, who will come to us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put [them] in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.
\[11]Likewise when all the Jews that [were] in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that [were] in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;
\[12]Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits in abundance.
\[13]Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, that [were] in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
\[14]And said to him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.
\[15]Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know [it]: why should he slay thee, that all the Jews who are gathered to thee should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?
\[16]But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.

ow it came to pass in the seventh month, [that] Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah.
\[2]Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
\[3]Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, [even] with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, [and] the men of war.
\[4]And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew [it],
\[5]That there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, [even] eighty men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring [them] to the house of the LORD.
\[6]And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said to them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
\[7]And it was [so], when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, [and cast them] into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that [were] with him.
\[8]But ten men were found among them that said to Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbore, and slew them not among their brethren.
\[9]Now the pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, [was] that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: [and] Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with [them that were] slain.
\[10]Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that [were] in Mizpah, [even] the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.
\[11]But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that [were] with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done.
\[12]Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that [are] in Gibeon.
\[13]Now it came to pass, [that] when all the people who [were] with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that [were] with him, then they were glad.
\[14]So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.
\[15]But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.
\[16]Then Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that [were] with him, took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpeh, after [that] he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, [even] mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon.
\[17]And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which [is] by Beth-lehem, to go to enter into Egypt,
\[18]Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.

\[3]That the LORD thy God may show us the way in which we may walk, and the thing that we may do.

\[5]Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.
\[6]Whether [it be] good, or whether [it be] evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.

\[10]If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull [you] down, and I will plant you, and not pluck [you] up: for I repent of the evil that I have done to you.
\[11]Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD; for I [am] with you, to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.
\[12]And I will show mercies to you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.
\[13]But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,
\[14]Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor hunger for bread; and there will we dwell:
\[15]And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;
\[16]Then it shall come to pass, [that] the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine of which ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.
\[17]So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.
\[18]For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As my anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem: so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.
\[19]The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.
\[20]For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me to the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us to the LORD our God; and according to all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare to us, and we will do [it].
\[21]And [now] I have this day declared [it] to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any [thing] for which he hath sent me to you.
\[22]Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go [and] to sojourn.

\[3]But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.
\[4]So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah.
\[5]But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that had returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;

\[11]And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, [and deliver] such [as are] for death to death; and such [as are] for captivity to captivity; and such [as are] for the sword to the sword.
\[12]And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.

\[2]Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and behold, this day they [are] a desolation, and no man dwelleth in them.
\[3]Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, [and] to serve other gods, whom they knew not, [neither] they, ye, nor your fathers.
\[4]Yet I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending [them], saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.
\[5]But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to other gods.
\[6]Wherefore my fury and my anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted [and] desolate, as at this day.
\[7]Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Why do ye commit [this] great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;
\[8]In that ye provoke me to wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are gone to dwell, that ye may cut yourselves off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
\[9]Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\[10]They are not humbled [even] to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.
\[11]Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.
\[12]And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, [and] fall in the land of Egypt; they shall [even] be consumed by the sword [and] by the famine: they shall die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, [and] an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
\[13]For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:
\[14]So that none of the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt, to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.
\[15]Then all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
\[16][As for] the word that thou hast spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken to thee.
\[17]But we will certainly do whatever thing proceedeth from our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for [then] we had plenty of provisions, and were well, and saw no evil.
\[18]But since we ceased to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her, we have wanted all [things], and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.
\[19]And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink-offerings to her, did we make for her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink-offerings to her, without our men?
\[20]Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people who had given him [that] answer, saying,
\[21]The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it [not] into his mind?
\[22]So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, [and] because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.
\[23]Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil hath happened to you, as at this day.
\[24]Moreover, Jeremiah said to all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that [are] in the land of Egypt:
\[25]Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.
\[26]Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.
\[27]Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that [are] in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there shall be an end of them.
\[28]Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that have gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.
\[29]And this [shall be] a sign to you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:
\[30]Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.

\[3]Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
\[4]Harness the horses; and mount, ye horsemen, and stand forth with [your] helmets; furbish the spears, [and] put on the coats of mail.
\[5]Why have I seen them dismayed [and] turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and have fled apace, and look not back: [for] fear [was] on all sides, saith the LORD.
\[6]Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape! they shall stumble, and fall towards the north by the river Euphrates.
\[7]Who [is] this [that] cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?
\[8]Egypt riseth up like a flood, and [his] waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, [and] will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and its inhabitants.
\[9]Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth: the Cushites and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians that handle [and] bend the bow.
\[10]For this [is] the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiated and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.
\[11]Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; [for] thou shalt not be cured.
\[12]The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, [and] they have fallen both together.

\[14]Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour around thee.
\[15]Why are thy valiant [men] swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them.
\[16]He made many to fall, yes, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.
\[17]They cried there, Pharaoh king of Egypt [is but] a noise; he hath passed the time appointed.
\[18][As] I live, saith the king, whose name [is] the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor [is] among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, [so] shall he come.
\[19]O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.
\[20]Egypt [is like] a very fair heifer, [but] destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north.
\[21]Also her hired men [are] in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also have turned back, [and] have fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity had come upon them, [and] the time of their visitation.

\[23]They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and [are] innumerable.
\[24]The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.
\[25]The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel saith: Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and [all] them that trust in him:
\[26]And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the LORD.
\[27]But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for behold, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make [him] afraid.
\[28]Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I [am] with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee: but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure; yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished.

he word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before Pharaoh smote Gaza.
\[2]Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is in it; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.
\[3]At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong [horses], at the rushing of his chariots, [and at] the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to [their] children for feebleness of hands:
\[4]Because of the day that cometh to lay waste all the Philistines, [and] to cut off from Tyre and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the LORD will lay waste the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.
\[5]Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off [with] the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?
\[6]O thou sword of the LORD, how long [will it be] ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.
\[7]How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it.

gainst Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe to Nebo! for it is laid waste: Kiriathaim is confounded [and] taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.
\[2][There shall be] no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from [being] a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.
\[3]A voice of crying [shall be] from Horonaim, devastation and great destruction.
\[4]Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
\[5]For in the ascent of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the descent of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.
\[6]Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
\[7]For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity [with] his priests and his princes together.
\[8]And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.
\[9]Give wings to Moab, that it may flee and get away: for its cities shall be desolate, without any to dwell in them.
\[10]Cursed [be] he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed [be] he that keepeth back his sword from blood.
\[11]Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.
\[12]Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send to him wanderers that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.
\[13]And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Beth-el their confidence.
\[14]How say ye, We [are] mighty and strong men for the war?
\[15]Moab is laid waste, and gone up [out of] her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the king, whose name [is] the LORD of hosts.
\[16]The calamity of Moab [is] near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.
\[17]All ye that are about him bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, [and] the beautiful rod!
\[18]Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from [thy] glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, [and] he shall destroy thy strong holds.
\[19]O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, [and] say, What is done?
\[20]Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.
\[21]And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,
\[22]And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim,
\[23]And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon,
\[24]And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.
\[25]The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.
\[26]Make ye him drunken; for he magnified [himself] against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.
\[27]For was not Israel a derision to thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou hast spoken of him, thou hast leaped for joy.
\[28]O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove [that] maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.
\[29]We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogance, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.
\[30]I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but [it shall] not [be] so; his lies shall not so effect [it].
\[31]Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; [my heart] shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.
\[32]O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants have gone over the sea, they reach [even] to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler hath fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.
\[33]And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the wine-presses: none shall tread with shouting; [their] shouting [shall be] no shouting.
\[34]From the cry of Heshbon [even] to Elealeh, [and even] to Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar [even] to Horonaim, [as] a heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.
\[35]Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.
\[36]Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and my heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches [that] he hath gotten have perished.
\[37]For every head [shall be] bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands [shall be] cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.
\[38][There shall be] lamentation generally upon all the house-tops of Moab, and in its streets: for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which [is] no pleasure, saith the LORD.
\[39]They shall howl, [saying], How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.
\[40]For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.
\[41]Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
\[42]And Moab shall be destroyed from [being] a people, because he hath magnified [himself] against the LORD.
\[43]Fear, and the pit, and the snare, [shall be] upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.
\[44]He that fleeth from the fear, shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth out of the pit, shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, [even] upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.
\[45]They that fled stood under the shade of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
\[46]Woe be to thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.
\[47]Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far [is] the judgment of Moab.

oncerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why [then] doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?
\[2]Therefore behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir to them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.
\[3]Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, [and] his priests and his princes together.
\[4]Why gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, [saying], Who shall come to me?
\[5]Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that are about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.
\[6]And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.
\[7]Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; [Is] wisdom no more in Teman? hath counsel perished from the prudent? hath their wisdom vanished?
\[8]Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time [that] I will visit him.
\[9]If grape-gatherers come to thee, would they not leave [some] gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.
\[10]But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is laid waste, and his brethren, and his neighbors, and he [is] not.
\[11]Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve [them] alive; and let thy widows trust in me.
\[12]For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment [was] not to drink of the cup have assuredly drank; and [art] thou he [that] shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink [of it].
\[13]For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all her cities shall be perpetual wastes.
\[14]I have heard a rumor from the LORD, and an embassador is sent to the heathen, [saying], Assemble, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.
\[15]For lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, [and] despised among men.
\[16]Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, [and] the pride of thy heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the hight of the hill: though thou shouldst make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.
\[17]Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all her plagues.
\[18]As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighboring [cities], saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.
\[19]Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who [is] a chosen [man], [that] I may appoint over her? for who [is] like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who [is] that shepherd that will stand before me?
\[20]Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.
\[21]The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise of it was heard in the Red sea.
\[22]Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
\[23]Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are faint-hearted; [there is] sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.
\[24]Damascus hath become feeble, [and] turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on [her]: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.
\[25]How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!
\[26]Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.
\[27]And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-hadad.
\[28]Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and lay waste the men of the east.
\[29]Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry to them, Fear [is] on every side.
\[30]Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.
\[31]Arise, go up to the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, [which] dwell alone.
\[32]And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them [that are] in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides of it, saith the LORD.

\[37]For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, [even] my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:
\[38]And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD.

he word that the LORD spoke against Babylon [and] against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.
\[2]Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, [and] conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.
\[3]For out of the north there cometh a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell in it, they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.
\[4]In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping; they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.
\[5]They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces towards it, [saying], Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant [that] shall not be forgotten.
\[6]My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away [on] the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their resting-place.
\[7]All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.
\[8]Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth from the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flocks.
\[9]For lo, I will raise and cause to come against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows [shall be] as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.
\[10]And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.
\[11]Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of my heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;
\[12]Your mother shall be greatly confounded; she that bore you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations [shall be] a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
\[13]Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.
\[14]Put yourselves in array against Babylon on every side: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD.
\[15]Shout against her on every side; she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it [is] the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do to her.
\[16]Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.
\[17]Israel [is] a scattered sheep; the lions have driven [him] away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.
\[18]Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.
\[19]And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.
\[20]In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and [there shall] be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.
\[21]Go up against the land of Merathaim, [even] against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.
\[22]A sound of battle [is] in the land, and of great destruction.
\[23]How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
\[24]I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.
\[25]The LORD hath opened his armory, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this [is] the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.
\[26]Come against her from the utmost border, open her store-houses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.
\[27]Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
\[28]The voice of them that flee and escape from the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.
\[29]Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, encamp against it on every side; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do to her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.
\[30]Therefore her young men shall fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.
\[31]Behold, I [am] against thee, [O thou] most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time [that] I will visit thee.
\[32]And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all around him.
\[33]Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah [were] oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.
\[34]Their Redeemer [is] strong; the LORD of hosts [is] his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
\[35]A sword [is] upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise [men].
\[36]A sword [is] upon the liars; and they shall be sottish: a sword [is] upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.
\[37]A sword [is] upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that [are] in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword [is] upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.
\[38]A drouth [is] upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it [is] the land of graven images, and they are mad upon [their] idols.
\[39]Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the isles, shall dwell [there], and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
\[40]As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighboring [cities], saith the LORD; [so] shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.
\[41]Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the borders of the earth.
\[42]They shall hold the bow and the lance: they [are] cruel, and will not show mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, [every one] put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
\[43]The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands became feeble: anguish took hold of him, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail.
\[44]Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan to the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who [is] a chosen [man], [that] I may appoint over her? for who [is] like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who [is] that shepherd that will stand before me?
\[45]Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make [their] habitation desolate with them.

\[4]Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and [they that are] thrust through in her streets.
\[5]For Israel [hath] not [been] forsaken, nor Judah by his God, by the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.
\[6]Flee from the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this [is] the time of the LORD'S vengeance; he will render to her a recompense.
\[7]Babylon [hath been] a golden cup in the LORD'S hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drank of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.
\[8]Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, it may be she may be healed.
\[9]We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth to heaven, and is lifted [even] to the skies.
\[10]The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.
\[11]Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his purpose [is] against Babylon, to destroy it; because it [is] the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.
\[12]Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.
\[13]O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thy end is come, [and] the measure of thy covetousness.
\[14]The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, [saying], Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillars; and they shall raise a shout against thee.
\[15]He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding.
\[16]When he uttereth [his] voice, [there is] a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
\[17]Every man is brutish by [his] knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image [is] falsehood, and [there is] no breath in them.
\[18]They [are] vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\[19]The portion of Jacob [is] not like them; for he [is] the former of all things: and [Israel is] the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts [is] his name.
\[20]Thou [art] my battle-ax [and] weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;
\[21]And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and its rider;
\[22]With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;
\[23]I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.
\[24]And I will render to Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD.
\[25]Behold, I [am] against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.
\[26]And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD.
\[27]Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars.
\[28]Prepare against her the nations with the kings of Media, her captains, and all her rulers, and all the land of his dominion.
\[29]And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.
\[30]The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they have remained in [their] holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwelling-places; her bars are broken.
\[31]One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at [one] end,
\[32]And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.
\[33]For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon [is] like a threshing-floor, [it is] time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.
\[34]Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out.
\[35]The violence done to me and to my flesh [be] upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.
\[36]Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.
\[37]And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling-place for dragons, an astonishment, and a hissing, without an inhabitant.
\[38]They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions' whelps.
\[39]In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD.
\[40]I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats.
\[41]How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!
\[42]The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of its waves.
\[43]Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land in which no man dwelleth, neither doth [any] son of man pass by it.
\[44]And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed: and the nations shall not flow together any more to him: even the wall of Babylon shall fall.
\[45]My people, depart from the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.
\[46]And lest your heart should faint, and ye should fear for the rumor that shall be heard in the land; a rumor shall both come [one] year, and after that in [another] year [shall come] a rumor, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.
\[47]Therefore behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
\[48]Then the heaven and the earth, and all that [is] in them, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come to her from the north, saith the LORD.
\[49]As Babylon [hath caused] the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.
\[50]Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
\[51]We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD'S house.
\[52]Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.
\[53]Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the hight of her strength, [yet] from me shall spoilers come to her, saith the LORD.
\[54]A sound of a cry [cometh] from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:
\[55]Because the LORD hath laid waste Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:
\[56]Because the spoiler is come upon her, [even] upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompenses shall surely requite.
\[57]And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise [men], her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the king, whose name [is] the LORD of hosts.
\[58]Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labor in vain, and the people in the fire, and they shall be weary.
\[59]The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And [this] Seraiah [was] a quiet prince.
\[60]So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, [even] all these words that are written against Babylon.
\[61]And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou shalt come to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;
\[62]Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.
\[63]And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, [that] thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:
\[64]And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far [are] the words of Jeremiah.

edekiah [was] one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\[2]And he did [that which was] evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
\[3]For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
\[4]And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, [that] Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it, and built forts against it on every side.
\[5]So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
\[6]And in the fourth month, in the ninth [day] of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
\[7]Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth from the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which [was] by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans [were] by the city on all sides:) and they went by the way of the plain.
\[8]But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
\[9]Then they took the king, and carried him to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.
\[10]And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
\[11]Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
\[12]Now in the fifth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, which [was] the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, [who] served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,
\[13]And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great [men] he burned with fire:
\[14]And all the army of the Chaldeans, that [were] with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem on every side.
\[15]Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive [certain] of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
\[16]But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left [certain] of the poor of the land for vine-dressers and for husbandmen.
\[17]Also the pillars of brass that [were] in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that [was] in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
\[18]The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, they took away.
\[19]And the basins, and the fire-pans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; [that] which [was] of gold [in] gold, and [that] which [was] of silver [in] silver, the captain of the guard took away.
\[20]The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brazen bulls that [were] under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
\[21]And [concerning] the pillars, the hight of one pillar [was] eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits encompassed it; and the thickness of it [was] four fingers: [it was] hollow.
\[22]And a capital of brass [was] upon it; and the hight of one capital [was] five cubits, with net-work and pomegranates upon the capitals around, all [of] brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates [were] like to these.
\[23]And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; [and] all the pomegranates upon the net-work [were] a hundred on all sides.
\[24]And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:
\[25]He took also out of the city a eunuch, who had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, who were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.
\[26]So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
\[27]And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah, in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.
\[28]This [is] the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:
\[29]In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:
\[30]In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons [were] four thousand and six hundred.
\[31]And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth [day] of the month, [that] Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the [first] year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him out of prison,
\[32]And spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that [were] with him in Babylon,
\[33]And changed his prison garments: and he continually ate bread before him all the days of his life.
\[34]And [for] his food there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.

ow doth the city sit solitary, [that was] full of people! [how] is she become as a widow! she [that was] great among the nations, [and] princess among the provinces, [how] is she become tributary.
\[2]She weepeth bitterly in the night, and her tears [are] on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort [her]: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.
\[3]Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.
\[4]The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she [is] in bitterness.
\[5]Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.
\[6]And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty hath departed: her princes are become like harts [that] find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.
\[7]Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none helped her: the adversaries saw her, [and] mocked at her sabbaths.
\[8]Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yes, she sigheth and turneth backward.
\[9]Her filthiness [is] in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she hath been wonderfully abased: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified [himself].
\[10]The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen [that] the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command [that] they should not enter into thy congregation.
\[11]All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for food to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile.
\[12][Is it] nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, which hath fallen upon me, with which the LORD hath afflicted [me] in the day of his fierce anger.
\[13]From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate [and] faint all the day.
\[14]The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, [and] come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into [their] hands, [from whom] I am not able to rise.
\[15]The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty [men] in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, [as] in a wine-press.
\[16]For these [things] I weep; my eye, my eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.
\[17]Zion spreadeth forth her hands, [and there is] none to comfort her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, [that] his adversaries [should be] around him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.
\[18]The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
\[19]I called for my lovers, [but] they deceived me: my priests and my elders resigned their breath in the city, while they sought their food to relieve their souls.
\[20]Behold, O LORD; for I [am] in distress: my bowels are troubled; my heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home [there is] as death.
\[21]They have heard that I sigh: [there is] none to comfort me: all my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done [it]: thou wilt bring the day [that] thou hast called, and they shall be like me.
\[22]Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do to them, as thou hast done to me for all my transgressions: for my sighs [are] many, and my heart [is] faint.

ow hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, [and] cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!
\[2]The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought [them] down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and its princes.
\[3]He hath cut off in [his] fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, [which] devoureth on every side.
\[4]He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all [that were] pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.
\[5]The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
\[6]And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as [if it were of] a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and in the indignation of his anger hath despised the king and the priest.
\[7]The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.
\[8]The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.
\[9]Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes [are] among the Gentiles: the law [is] no [more]: her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.
\[10]The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, [and] keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
\[11]My eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.
\[12]They say to their mothers, Where [is] corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.
\[13]What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach [is] great like the sea: who can heal thee?
\[14]Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not revealed thy iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.
\[15]All that pass by, clap [their] hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, [saying], [Is] this the city that [men] call the Perfection of beauty, the Joy of the whole earth?
\[16]All thy enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed [her] up: certainly this [is] the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen [it].
\[17]The LORD hath done [that] which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused [thy] enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thy adversaries.
\[18]Their heart cried to the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thy eye cease.
\[19]Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands towards him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street.
\[20]Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?
\[21]The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword; thou hast slain [them] in the day of thy anger; thou hast killed, [and] not pitied.
\[22]Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors around, so that in the day of the LORD'S anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up, hath my enemy consumed.

\[31]For the Lord will not cast off for ever:
\[32]But though he causeth grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.
\[33]For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.

ow it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I [was] among the captives by the river of Kebar, [that] the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
\[2]In the fifth [day] of the month, which [was] the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,
\[3]The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Kebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.
\[4]And I looked, and behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness [was] about it, and from the midst of it as the color of amber, from the midst of the fire.
\[5]Also from the midst of it [came] the likeness of four living creatures. And this [was] their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.
\[6]And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.
\[7]And their feet [were] straight feet; and the sole of their feet [was] like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass.
\[8]And [they had] the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.
\[9]Their wings [were] joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.
\[10]As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.
\[11]Thus [were] their faces: and their wings [were] stretched upward; two [wings] of every one [were] joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
\[12]And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; [and] they turned not when they went.
\[13]As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance [was] like burning coals of fire, [and] like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
\[14]And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
\[15]Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.
\[16]The appearance of the wheels and their work [was] like the color of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work [was] as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
\[17]When they went, they went upon their four sides: [and] they returned not when they went.
\[18]As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings [were] full of eyes around them four.
\[19]And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
\[20]Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither [was their] spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature [was] in the wheels.
\[21]When those went, [these] went; and when those stood, [these] stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature [was] in the wheels.
\[22]And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature [was] as the color of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.
\[23]And under the firmament [were] their wings straight, the one towards the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.
\[24]And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings.
\[25]And there was a voice from the firmament that [was] over their heads, when they stood, [and] had let down their wings.
\[26]And above the firmament that [was] over their heads [was] the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne [was] the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.
\[27]And I saw as the color of amber, as the appearance of fire around within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness on all sides.
\[28]As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so [was] the appearance of the brightness around. This [was] the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw [it], I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one speaking.

\[2]And the spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spoke to me.
\[3]And he said to me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me: [even] to this very day.
\[4]For [they are] impudent children and obstinate in heart. I send thee to them; and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.
\[5]And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they [are] a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.
\[6]And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns [are] with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they [are] a rebellious house.
\[7]And thou shalt speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they [are] most rebellious.
\[8]But thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.
\[9]And when I looked, behold, a hand [was] sent to me; and lo, a roll of a book [was] in it;

\[2]So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.
\[3]And he said to me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat [it]; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
\[4]And he said to me, Son of man, depart, go to the house of Israel, and speak with my words to them.
\[5]For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, [but] to the house of Israel;
\[6]Not to many people of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened to thee.
\[7]But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee; for they will not hearken to me: for all the house of Israel [are] impudent and hard-hearted.
\[8]Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.
\[9]As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they [are] a rebellious house.
\[10]Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thy ears.
\[11]And depart, go to them of the captivity, to the children of thy people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
\[12]Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed [be] the glory of the LORD from his place.
\[13][I heard] also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and the noise of a great rushing.
\[14]So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.
\[15]Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Kebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.
\[16]And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[17]Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
\[18]When I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked [man] shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
\[19]Yet if thou shalt warn the wicked, and he shall not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
\[20]Again, When a righteous [man] doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
\[21]Nevertheless if thou shalt warn the righteous [man], that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.
\[22]And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.
\[23]Then I arose, and went forth into the plain; and behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Kebar: and I fell on my face.
\[24]Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.
\[25]But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:
\[26]And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they [are] a rebellious house.
\[27]But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they [are] a rebellious house.

\[3]Moreover take thou to thee an iron pan, and set it [for] a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This [shall be] a sign to the house of Israel.
\[4]Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: [according] to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.

\[6]And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.

\[12]And thou shalt eat it [as] barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with human excrement in their sight.
\[13]And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.
\[14]Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither hath abominable flesh come into my mouth.
\[15]Then he said to me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread with them.

\[7]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that [are] around you, [and] have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that [are] around you:
\[8]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, [am] against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.
\[9]And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and the like to which I will not do any more, because of all thy abominations.
\[10]Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.
\[11]Wherefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thy abominations, therefore I will also diminish [thee]; neither shall my eye spare, neither will I have any pity.
\[12]A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword around thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.
\[13]Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken [it] in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.
\[14]Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that [are] around thee, in the sight of all that pass by.
\[15]So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment to the nations that [are] around thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken [it].
\[16]When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for [their] destruction, [and] which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:
\[17]So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken [it].

\[25]Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and [there shall be] none.
\[26]Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.

\[6]And it came to pass, [that] when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.
\[7]And [one] cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim, to the fire that [was] between the cherubim, and took [of it], and put [it] into the hands of [him that was] clothed with linen: who took [it], and went out.
\[8]And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings.
\[9]And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels [was] as the color of a beryl stone.
\[10]And [as for] their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.
\[11]When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked, they followed it; they turned not as they went.
\[12]And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, [were] full of eyes on every side, [even] the wheels that they four had.
\[13]As for the wheels, it was cried to them in my hearing, O wheel.
\[14]And every one had four faces: the first face [was] the face of a cherub, and the second face [was] the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
\[15]And the cherubim were lifted up. This [is] the living creature that I saw by the river of Kebar.
\[16]And when the cherubim went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.
\[17]When they stood, [these] stood; and when they were lifted up, [these] lifted up themselves [also]: for the spirit of the living creature [was] in them.
\[18]Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshhold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.
\[19]And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also [were] beside them, and [every one] stood at the door of the east-gate of the LORD'S house; and the glory of the God of Israel [was] over them above.
\[20]This [is] the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Kebar; and I knew that they [were] the cherubim.
\[21]Every one had four faces each, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man [was] under their wings.
\[22]And the likeness of their faces [was] the same faces which I saw by the river of Kebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.

oreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east-gate of the LORD'S house, which looketh eastward: and behold, at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.
\[2]Then said he to me, Son of man, these [are] the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:
\[3]Who say, [It is] not near; let us build houses: this [city is] the caldron, and we [are] the flesh.
\[4]Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.
\[5]And the spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said to me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, [every one of] them.
\[6]Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled its streets with the slain.
\[7]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they [are] the flesh, and this [city is] the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.
\[8]Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD.
\[9]And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.
\[10]Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.
\[11]This [city] shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst of it; [but] I will judge you in the border of Israel:
\[12]And ye shall know that I [am] the LORD: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that [are] around you.
\[13]And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?
\[14]Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[15]Son of man, thy brethren, [even] thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, [are] they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Retire far from the LORD: to us is this land given in possession.
\[16]Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.
\[17]Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
\[18]And they shall come thither, and they shall take away from thence all its detestable things, and all its abominations.
\[19]And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh:
\[20]That they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
\[21]But [as for them] whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.
\[22]Then the cherubim raised their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel [was] over them above.
\[23]And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which [is] on the east side of the city.
\[24]Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.
\[25]Then I spoke to them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shown me.

he word of the LORD also came to me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they [are] a rebellious house.
\[3]Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight; it may be they will consider, though they [are] a rebellious house.
\[4]Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at evening in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.
\[5]Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
\[6]In their sight shalt thou bear [it] upon [thy] shoulders, [and] carry [it] forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou mayest not see the ground: for I have set thee [for] a sign to the house of Israel.
\[7]And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the evening I digged through the wall with my hand; I brought [it] forth in the twilight, [and] I bore [it] upon [my] shoulder in their sight.
\[8]And in the morning came the word of the LORD to me, saying,
\[9]Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to thee, What doest thou?
\[10]Say thou to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD, This burden [concerneth] the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that [are] among them.
\[11]Say, I [am] your sign: as I have done, so shall it be done to them: they shall remove [and] go into captivity.
\[12]And the prince that [is] among them shall bear upon [his] shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he may not see the ground with [his] eyes.
\[13]My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon [to] the land of the Chaldeans, yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.
\[14]And I will scatter towards every wind all that [are] about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.
\[15]And they shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.
\[16]But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.
\[17]Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[18]Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with solicitude.
\[19]And say to the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, [and] of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with solicitude, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.
\[20]And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.
\[21]And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[22]Son of man, what [is] that proverb [that] ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?
\[23]Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say to them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.
\[24]For there shall no more be any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.
\[25]For I [am] the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall no more be prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.
\[26]Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[27]Son of man, behold, [they of] the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth [is] for many days [to come], and he prophesieth of the times [that are] distant.
\[28]Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be further deferred, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.

\[2]Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou to them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the LORD;
\[3]Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
\[4]O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.
\[5]Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.
\[6]They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made [others] to hope that they would confirm the word.
\[7]Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith [it], although I have not spoken?
\[8]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I [am] against you, saith the Lord GOD.
\[9]And my hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I [am] the Lord GOD.
\[10]Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and [there was] no peace; and one built up a wall, and lo, others daubed it with untempered [mortar]:
\[11]Say to them who daub [it] with untempered [mortar], that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend [it].
\[12]Lo, when the wall hath fallen, shall it not be said to you, Where [is] the daubing with which ye have daubed [it]?
\[13]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend [it] with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in [my] fury to consume [it].
\[14]So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered [mortar], and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation shall be made bare, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst of it: and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.
\[15]Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered [mortar], and will say to you, The wall [is] no [more], neither they that daubed it;
\[16][To wit], the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, and [there is] no peace, saith the Lord GOD.
\[17]Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, who prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,
\[18]And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the [women] that sew pillows to all arm-holes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive [that come] to you?
\[19]And will ye profane me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear [your] lies?
\[20]Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [am] against your pillows, with which ye there hunt the souls to make [them] fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, [even] the souls that ye hunt to make [them] fly.
\[21]Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall no more be in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.
\[22]Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:
\[23]Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.

\[2]And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[3]Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?
\[4]Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;
\[5]That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
\[6]Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn [yourselves] from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
\[7]For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, who separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to inquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:
\[8]And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.
\[9]And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
\[10]And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh [to him];
\[11]That the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.
\[12]The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
\[13]Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out my hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:
\[14]Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver their own souls only by their righteousness, saith the Lord GOD.
\[15]If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they lay it waste, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:
\[16][Though] these three men [were] in it, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.
\[17]Or [if] I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:
\[18]Though these three men [were] in it, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.
\[19]Or [if] I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:
\[20]Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, [were] in it, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall deliver their own souls only by their righteousness.
\[21]For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four severe judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?
\[22]Yet behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, [both] sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth to you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, [even] concerning all that I have brought upon it.
\[23]And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.

gain the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,
\[3]And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD to Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity [is] of the land of Canaan; thy father [was] an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite.
\[4]And [as for] thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple [thee]; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.
\[5]No eye pitied thee, to do any of these to thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.
\[6]And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thy own blood, I said to thee [when thou wast] in thy blood, Live; yes, I said to thee [when thou wast] in thy blood, Live.
\[7]I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and become great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: [thy] breasts are fashioned, and thy hair is grown, whereas thou [wast] naked and bare.
\[8]Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time [was] the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yes, I swore to thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine.
\[9]Then I washed thee with water; yes, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.
\[10]I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.
\[11]I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.
\[12]And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and ear-rings in thy ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.
\[13]Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment [was of] fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.
\[14]And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it [was] perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.
\[15]But thou didst trust in thy own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.
\[16]And of thy garments thou didst take, and deck thy high places with divers colors, and play the harlot upon them: [the like things] shall not come, neither shall it be [so].
\[17]Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and hast made to thyself images of men, and hast committed lewdness with them.
\[18]And hast taken thy broidered garments, and covered them: and thou hast set my oil and my incense before them.
\[19]My provisions also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, [with which] I fed thee, thou hast even set before them for a sweet savor: and [thus] it was, saith the Lord GOD.
\[20]Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne to me, and these hast thou sacrificed to them to be devoured. [Is this] of thy lewdness a small matter,
\[21]That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through [the fire] for them?
\[22]And in all thy abominations and thy deeds of lewdness thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, [and] wast polluted in thy blood.
\[23]And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe to thee! saith the Lord GOD;)
\[24][That] thou hast also built to thee an eminent place, and hast made thee a high place in every street.
\[25]Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast prostituted thyself to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy lewd deeds.
\[26]Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbors, great of flesh; and hast multiplied thy lewd deeds, to provoke me to anger.
\[27]Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thy ordinary [food], and delivered thee to the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of thy lewd way.
\[28]Thou hast played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because thou wast insatiable; yes, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldst not be satisfied.
\[29]Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan to Chaldea; and yet with this thou wast not satisfied.
\[30]How weak is thy heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these [things], the work of an imperious lewd woman;
\[31]In that thou buildest thy eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thy high place in every street; and hast not been as a harlot, in that thou scornest hire;
\[32][But as] a wife that committeth adultery, [who] taketh strangers instead of her husband!
\[33]They give gifts to all lewd women: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come to thee on every side for thy lewdness.
\[34]And the contrary is in thee from [other] women in thy unlawful commerce, whereas none followeth thee to commit lewdness: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given to thee, therefore thou art contrary.
\[35]Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:
\[36]Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness exposed through thy carnal connection with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give to them;
\[37]Behold therefore, I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all [them] that thou hast loved, with all [them] that thou hast hated; I will even gather them on every side against thee, and will uncover thy nakedness to them, that they may see all thy nakedness.
\[38]And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.
\[39]And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thy eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.
\[40]They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.
\[41]And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.
\[42]So will I make my fury towards thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.
\[43]Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast provoked me in all these [things]; behold therefore, I also will recompense thy way upon [thy] head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thy abominations.
\[44]Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use [this] proverb against thee, saying, As [is] the mother, [so is] her daughter.
\[45]Thou [art] thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou [art] the sister of thy sisters, who lothed their husbands and their children: your mother [was] a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
\[46]And thy elder sister [is] Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, [is] Sodom and her daughters.
\[47]Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but as [if that were] a very little [thing], thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.
\[48][As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.
\[49]Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
\[50]And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw [good].
\[51]Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thy abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thy abominations which thou hast done.
\[52]Thou also, who hast judged thy sisters, bear thy own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yes, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.
\[53]When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then [will I bring again] the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:
\[54]That thou mayest bear thy own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort to them.
\[55]When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former state.
\[56]For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,
\[57]Before thy wickedness was disclosed, as at the time of [thy] reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all [that are] around her, the daughters of the Philistines, who despise thee on every side.
\[58]Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thy abominations, saith the LORD.
\[59]For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.
\[60]Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish to thee an everlasting covenant.
\[61]Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thy elder and thy younger: and I will give them to thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.
\[62]And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD:
\[63]That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.

nd the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;
\[3]And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, long-winged, full of feathers, which had divers colors, came to Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:
\[4]He cropped off the top of its young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.
\[5]He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed [it] by great waters, [and] set it [as] a willow tree.
\[6]And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned towards him, and its roots were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.
\[7]There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and behold, this vine did bend her roots towards him, and shot forth her branches towards him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.
\[8]It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.
\[9]Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up its roots, and cut off its fruit, that it may wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by its roots.
\[10]Yes, behold, [being] planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.
\[11]Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[12]Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these [things mean]? tell [them], Behold, the king of Babylon hath come to Jerusalem, and hath taken its king, and its princes, and led them with him to Babylon;
\[13]And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath from him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:
\[14]That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, [but] that by keeping his covenant it might stand.
\[15]But he rebelled against him in sending his embassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such [things]? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?
\[16][As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place [where] the king [dwelleth] that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, [even] with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.
\[17]Neither shall Pharaoh with [his] mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:
\[18]Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these [things], he shall not escape.
\[19]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; [As] I live, surely my oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even that will I recompense upon his own head.
\[20]And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.
\[21]And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered towards all winds: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken [it].
\[22]Thus saith the Lord GOD, I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set [it]; I will crop off from the top of its young twigs a tender one, and will plant [it] upon a high mountain and eminent:
\[23]In the mountain of the hight of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shade of its branches shall they dwell.
\[24]And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done [it].

\[2]What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?
\[3][As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have [occasion] any more to use this proverb in Israel.
\[4]Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.
\[5]But if a man is just, and doeth that which is lawful and right,
\[6][And] hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbor's wife, neither hath come near to a polluted woman,
\[7]And hath not oppressed any, [but] hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath stripped none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment:
\[8]He [that] hath not given forth upon interest, neither hath taken any increase, [that] hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man,
\[9]Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he [is] just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD.
\[10]If he begetteth a son [that is] a robber, a shedder of blood, and [that] doeth the like to [any] one of these [things],
\[11]And that doeth not any of those [duties], but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbor's wife,
\[12]Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath stripped by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination.
\[13]Hath given forth upon interest, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
\[14]Now lo, [if] he begetteth a son, that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,
\[15][That] hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbor's wife,
\[16]Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withheld the pledge, neither hath stripped by violence, [but] hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment,
\[17][That] hath taken off his hand from the poor, [that] hath not received interest nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.
\[18][As for] his father, because he cruelly oppressed, stripped his brother by violence, and did [that] which [is] not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.
\[19]Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, [and] hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.
\[20]The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
\[21]But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
\[22]All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned to him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.
\[23]Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: [and] not that he should return from his ways, and live?
\[24]But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, [and] doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked [man] doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.
\[25]Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?
\[26]When a righteous [man] turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.
\[27]Again, when a wicked [man] turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.
\[28]Because he considereth and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
\[29]Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?
\[30]Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn [yourselves] from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.
\[31]Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
\[32]For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn [ye], and live.

\[2]And say, What [is] thy mother: A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.
\[3]And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.
\[4]The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt.
\[5]Now when she saw that she had waited, [and] her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, [and] made him a young lion.

nd it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth [month], the tenth [day] of the month, [that] certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me.
\[2]Then came the word of the LORD to me, saying,
\[3]Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to inquire of me? [As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.
\[4]Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge [them]? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:
\[5]And say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up my hand to them, saying, I [am] the LORD your God;
\[6]In the day [that] I lifted up my hand to them, to bring them forth from the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which [is] the glory of all lands:
\[7]Then said I to them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I [am] the LORD your God.
\[8]But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken to me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
\[9]But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned before the heathen, among whom they [were], in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth from the land of Egypt.
\[10]Wherefore I caused them to go forth from the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.
\[11]And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments, which [if] a man doeth, he shall even live in them.
\[12]Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I [am] the LORD that sanctify them.
\[13]But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which [if] a man doeth, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
\[14]But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.
\[15]Yet also I lifted up my hand to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given [them], flowing with milk and honey, which [is] the glory of all lands;
\[16]Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but profaned my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.
\[17]Nevertheless my eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.
\[18]But I said to their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:
\[19]I [am] the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;
\[20]And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I [am] the LORD your God.
\[21]Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which [if] a man doeth, he shall even live in them: they profaned my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
\[22]Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.
\[23]I lifted up my hand to them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;
\[24]Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.
\[25]Wherefore I gave them also statutes [that were] not good, and judgments by which they should not live;
\[26]And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through [the fire] all the first-born, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I [am] the LORD.
\[27]Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
\[28][For] when I had brought them into the land, [for] which I lifted up my hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savor, and poured out there their drink-offerings.
\[29]Then I said to them, What [is] the high place to which ye go? and its name is called Bamah to this day.
\[30]Wherefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye lewd deeds after their abominations?
\[31]For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even to this day: and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? [As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.
\[32]And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
\[33][As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with an out-stretched arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:
\[34]And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries in which ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an out-stretched arm, and with fury poured out.
\[35]And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.
\[36]As I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.
\[37]And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
\[38]And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.
\[39]As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter [also], if ye will not hearken to me: but profane ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.
\[40]For on my holy mountain, on the mountain of the hight of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first fruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.
\[41]I will accept you with your sweet savor, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries in which ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.
\[42]And ye shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country [for] which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers.
\[43]And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings in which ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.
\[44]And ye shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.

\[4]Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth from its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:
\[5]That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn my sword out of its sheath: it shall not return any more.

\[8]Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[9]Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:
\[10]It is sharpened to make a grievous slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, [as] every tree.
\[11]And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: the sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
\[12]Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it [shall be] upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon [thy] thigh.
\[13]Because [it is] a trial, and what if [the sword] contemneth even the rod? it shall be no [more], saith the Lord GOD.
\[14]Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite [thy] hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it [is] the sword of the great [men that are] slain, which entereth into their private chambers.
\[15]I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that [their] heart may faint, and [their] ruins be multiplied: ah! [it is] made bright, [it is] sharpened for the slaughter.
\[16]Go thee one way or other, [either] on the right hand, [or] on the left, whithersoever thy face [is] set.
\[17]I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said [it].
\[18]The word of the LORD came to me again, saying,
\[19]Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both [ways] shall come forth from one land: and choose thou a place, choose [it] at the head of the way to the city.
\[20]Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbah of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.
\[21]For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he made [his] arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.
\[22]At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint [battering] rams against the gates, to cast a mount, [and] to build a fort.
\[23]And it shall be to them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.
\[24]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are disclosed, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, [I say], that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.
\[25]And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity [shall have] an end,
\[26]Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this [shall] not [be] the same: exalt [him that is] low, and abase [him that is] high.
\[27]I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: and it shall be no [more], until he cometh whose right it is; and I will give it [him].
\[28]And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword [is] drawn: for the slaughter [it is] furbished, to consume because of the glittering:
\[29]While they see vanity to thee, while they divine a lie to thee, to bring thee upon the necks of [them that are] slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity [shall have] an end.
\[30]Shall I cause [it] to return into its sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.
\[31]And I will pour out my indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, [and] skillful to destroy.

\[4]Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself by thy idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come [even] to thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach to the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.
\[5][Those that are] near, and [those that are] far from thee, shall mock thee, [who art] infamous [and] much troubled.

\[7]In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they oppressed the fatherless and the widow.
\[8]Thou hast despised my holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.
\[9]In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.

\[11]And one hath committed abomination with his neighbor's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.

\[20][As] they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt [it]; so will I gather [you] in my anger and in my fury, and I will leave [you there], and melt you.
\[21]Yes, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst of it.
\[22]As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst of it; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.
\[23]And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[24]Son of man, say to her, Thou [art] the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.
\[25][There is] a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst of her, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst of her.
\[26]Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shown [difference] between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
\[27]Her princes in the midst of her [are] like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, [and] to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.
\[28]And her prophets have daubed them with untempered [mortar], seeing vanity, and divining lies to them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.
\[29]The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have oppressed the poor and needy: yes, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.

he word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
\[3]And they committed lewd deeds in Egypt; they committed lewd deeds in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they were first corrupted.
\[4]And the names of them [were] Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bore sons and daughters. Thus [were] their names; Samaria [is] Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.
\[5]And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians [her] neighbors.
\[6][Who were] clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.
\[7]Thus she committed her lewd deeds with them, with all them [that were] the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.
\[8]Neither left she her lewd deeds [brought] from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they first corrupted her, and poured their impurities upon her.
\[9]Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
\[10]These uncovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.
\[11]And when her sister Aholibah saw [this], she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her prostitutions more than her sister in [her] prostitutions.
\[12]She doted upon the Assyrians [her] neighbors, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.
\[13]Then I saw that she was defiled, [that] they [took] both one way.
\[14]And [that] she increased her prostitutions: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion.
\[15]Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:
\[16]And as soon as she saw them with her eyes she doted upon them, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.
\[17]And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their lewdness, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.
\[18]So she disclosed her lewd deeds, and exposed her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, as my mind was alienated from her sister.
\[19]Yet she multiplied her prostitutions, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, in which she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
\[20]For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh [is as] the flesh of asses, and whose issue [is like] the issue of horses.
\[21]Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, by being corrupted by the Egyptians in thy youth.
\[22]Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;
\[23]The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, [and] all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.
\[24]And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, [which] shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet on every side: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.
\[25]And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thy ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.
\[26]They shall also strip thee of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.
\[27]Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy adultery [brought] from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thy eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.
\[28]For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand [of them] whom thou hatest, into the hand [of them] from whom thy mind is alienated:
\[29]And they shall treat thee with hatred, and shall take away all thy labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy prostitutions shall be disclosed, both thy lewdness and thy prostitutions.
\[30]I will do these [things] to thee, because thou hast gone astray after the heathen, [and] because thou art polluted with their idols.
\[31]Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thy hand.
\[32]Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large: thou shalt be treated with scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.
\[33]Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.
\[34]Thou shalt even drink it, and empty it to the dregs, and thou shalt break its pieces, and pluck off thy own breasts: for I have spoken [it], saith the Lord GOD.
\[35]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy prostitutions.
\[36]The LORD said moreover to me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yes, declare to them their abominations;
\[37]That they have committed adultery, and blood [is] in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass for them through [the fire], to devour [them].
\[38]Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.
\[39]For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and lo, thus have they done in the midst of my house.
\[40]And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, to whom a messenger [was] sent; and lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paint thy eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments,
\[41]And sattest upon a stately bed and a table prepared before it, upon which thou hast set my incense and my oil.
\[42]And a voice of a multitude being at ease [was] with her: and with the men of the common sort [were] brought Sabeans from the wilderness, who put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.
\[43]Then said I to [her that was] old in adulteries, Will they now commit lewd deeds with her, and she [with them]?
\[44]Yet they went in to her, as they go in to a woman that playeth the harlot: so they went in to Aholah and to Aholibah, the lewd women.
\[45]And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they [are] adulteresses, and blood [is] in their hands.
\[46]For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and plundered.
\[47]And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn their houses with fire.
\[48]Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.
\[49]And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I [am] the Lord GOD.

\[2]Son of man, Write for thee the name of the day, [even] of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.
\[3]And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set [it] on, and also pour water into it:
\[4]Gather its pieces into it, [even] every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill [it] with the choice bones.
\[5]Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, [and] make it boil well, and let them boil its bones in it.
\[6]Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum [is] therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.
\[7]For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;
\[8]That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.
\[9]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.
\[10]Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.
\[11]Then set it empty upon its coals, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and [that] the filthiness of it may be melted in it, [that] the scum of it may be consumed.
\[12]She hath wearied [herself] with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum [shall be] in the fire.
\[13]In thy filthiness [is] lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.
\[14]I the LORD have spoken [it]; it shall come to pass, and I will do [it]; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.
\[15]Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[16]Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thy eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.
\[17]Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thy head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not [thy] lips, and eat not the bread of men.
\[18]So I spoke to the people in the morning: and at evening my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
\[19]And the people said to me, Wilt thou not tell us what these [things are] to us, that thou doest [so]?
\[20]Then I answered them, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[21]Speak to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellence of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.
\[22]And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover [your] lips, nor eat the bread of men.
\[23]And your tires [shall be] upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one towards another.
\[24]Thus Ezekiel is to you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I [am] the Lord GOD.
\[25]Also, thou son of man, [shall it] not [be] in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that on which they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,
\[26][That] he that escapeth in that day shall come to thee, to cause [thee] to hear [it] with [thy] ears?
\[27]In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him who hath escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign to them; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

\[4]Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.

\[7]Behold, therefore I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD.

\[11]And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.
\[12]Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;
\[13]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.

\[3]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [am] against thee, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth its waves to come up.
\[4]And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.
\[5]It shall be [a place for] the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken [it], saith the Lord GOD: and it shall become a spoil to the nations.
\[6]And her daughters who [are] in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.
\[7]For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyre Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.
\[8]He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee.
\[9]And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.
\[10]By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city in which is made a breach.
\[11]With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.
\[12]And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.
\[13]And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.
\[14]And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be [a place] to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken [it], saith the Lord GOD.
\[15]Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyre; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?
\[16]Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at [every] moment, and be astonished at thee.
\[17]And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, [that wast] inhabited by sea-faring men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, who cause their terror [to be] on all that haunt it!
\[18]Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yes, the isles that [are] in the sea shall be disturbed at thy departure.
\[19]For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee;
\[20]When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living;

\[12]And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries [that are] desolate, and her cities among the cities [that are] laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
\[13]Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:
\[14]And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return [into] the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.
\[15]It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.
\[16]And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth [their] iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I [am] the Lord GOD.
\[17]And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first [month], in the first [day] of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[18]Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head [was] made bald, and every shoulder [was] peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyre, for the service that he had served against it:
\[19]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.
\[20]I have given him the land of Egypt [for] his labor with which he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD.
\[21]In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

\[3]For the day [is] near, even the day of the LORD [is] near, a cloudy day; it shall be the time of the heathen.
\[4]And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in Cush, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.
\[5]Cush, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Kub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.
\[6]Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.
\[7]And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries [that are] desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities [that are] wasted.

\[10]Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.
\[11]He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.
\[12]And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is in it, by the hand of strangers: I the LORD have spoken [it].
\[13]Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause [their] images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.
\[14]And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments in No.
\[15]And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.
\[16]And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be rent asunder, and Noph [shall have] distresses daily.

\[2]Son of man, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?
\[3]Behold, the Assyrian [was] a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shady cover, and of a high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.
\[4]The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round his plants, and sent out her little rivers to all the trees of the field.
\[5]Therefore his hight was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.
\[6]All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shade dwelt all great nations.
\[7]Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.
\[8]The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir-trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut-trees were not like his branches; not any tree in the garden of God was like to him in his beauty.
\[9]I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that [were] in the garden of God, envied him.
\[10]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in hight, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his hight;
\[11]I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.
\[12]And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth have gone down from his shade, and have left him.
\[13]Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:
\[14]To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their hight, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their hight, all that drink water: for they are all delivered to death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
\[15]Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained its floods, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
\[16]I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to the grave with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
\[17]They also went down into the grave with him to [them that are] slain with the sword; and [they that were] his arm, [that] dwelt under his shade in the midst of the heathen.
\[18]To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden to the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with [them that are] slain by the sword.

\[3]Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net.
\[4]Then will I leave thee upon the land, and I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.

\[13]I will destroy also all its beasts from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man disturb them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts disturb them.

gain the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say to them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their borders, and set him for their watchman:
\[3]If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he shall blow the trumpet, and warn the people;
\[4]Then whoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword shall come and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.
\[5]He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.
\[6]But if the watchman shall see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword shall come, and take [any] person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.
\[7]So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman to the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.
\[8]When I say to the wicked, O wicked [man], thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked [man] shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
\[9]Nevertheless, if thou shalt warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he shall not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
\[10]Therefore, O thou son of man, speak to the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins [are] upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?
\[11]Say to them, [As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked should turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
\[12]Therefore, thou son of man, say to the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall by it in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his [righteousness] in the day that he sinneth.
\[13]When I shall say to the righteous, [that] he shall surely live; if he shall trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.
\[14]Again, when I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he shall turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;
\[15][If] the wicked shall restore the pledge, give again that which he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.
\[16]None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned to him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
\[17]Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.
\[18]When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, for that he shall even die.
\[19]But if the wicked shall turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, for that he shall live.
\[20]Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.
\[21]And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, [that] one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is smitten.
\[22]Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, before he that had escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.
\[23]Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[24]Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we [are] many; the land is given to us for inheritance.
\[25]Wherefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes towards your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?
\[26]Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbor's wife: and shall ye possess the land?
\[27]Say thou thus to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; [As] I live, surely they that [are] in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that [is] in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that [are] in the forts and in the caves shall die by the pestilence.
\[28]For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.
\[29]Then shall they know that I [am] the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.
\[30]Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD.
\[31]And they come to thee as the people come, and they sit before thee [as] my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they show much love, [but] their heart goeth after their covetousness.
\[32]And lo, thou [art] to them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do not perform them.
\[33]And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.

\[2]Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD to the shepherds; Woe [be] to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?
\[3]Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe yourselves with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: [but] ye feed not the flock.
\[4]The diseased ye have not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up [that which was] broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.
\[5]And they were scattered, because [there is] no shepherd: and they became food to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.
\[6]My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yes, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek [for them].
\[7]Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;
\[8][As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became food to every beast of the field, because [there was] no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;
\[9]Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;
\[10]Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [am] against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be food for them.
\[11]For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [even] I, will both search for my sheep, and seek them out.
\[12]As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep [that are] scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
\[13]And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
\[14]I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and [in] a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.
\[15]I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD.
\[16]I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up [that which was] broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.
\[17]And [as for] you, O my flock, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he-goats.
\[18][Seemeth it] a small thing to you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drank of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?
\[19]And [as for] my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.
\[20]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD to them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.
\[21]Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;
\[22]Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.
\[23]And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, [even] my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
\[24]And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken [it].
\[25]And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
\[26]And I will make them and the places around my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season; there shall be showers of blessing.
\[27]And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that subjected them to service.
\[28]And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make [them] afraid.
\[29]And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.
\[30]Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God [am] with them, and [that] they, [even] the house of Israel, [are] my people, saith the Lord GOD.

\[10]And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, [even] all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be built.
\[11]And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old states, and will do better [to you] than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.
\[12]Yes, I will cause men to walk upon you, [even] my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them [of men].
\[13]Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say to you, Thou [land] devourest men, and hast bereaved thy nations;
\[14]Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord GOD.
\[15]Neither will I cause [men] to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith the Lord GOD.
\[16]Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[17]Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.
\[18]Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols [with which] they had polluted it:
\[19]And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.
\[20]And when they entered among the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These [are] the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.
\[21]But I had pity for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.
\[22]Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not [this] for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.
\[23]And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I [am] the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
\[24]For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.
\[25]Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.
\[26]A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.
\[27]And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do [them].
\[28]And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
\[29]I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.
\[30]And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.
\[31]Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that [were] not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities, and for your abominations.
\[32]Not for your sakes do I [this], saith the Lord GOD, be it known to you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel.
\[33]Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause [you] to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be built.
\[34]And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.
\[35]And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities [are become] fortified, [and] are inhabited.
\[36]Then the heathen that are left around you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined [places], [and] plant that which was desolate: I the LORD have spoken [it], and I will do [it].
\[37]Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet [for] this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do [it] for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.
\[38]As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

he hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which [was] full of bones,
\[2]And caused me to pass by them around: and behold, [there were] very many in the open valley; and lo, [they were] very dry.
\[3]And he said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? and I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.
\[4]Again he said to me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say to them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.
\[5]Thus saith the Lord GOD to these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:
\[6]And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.
\[7]So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.
\[8]And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but [there was] no breath in them.
\[9]Then said he to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.
\[10]So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.
\[11]Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.
\[12]Therefore prophesy and say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.
\[13]And ye shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you out of your graves,
\[14]And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken [it], and performed [it], saith the LORD.
\[15]The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
\[16]Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and [for] all the house of Israel his companions:
\[17]And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thy hand.
\[18]And when the children of thy people shall speak to thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou [meanest] by these?
\[19]Say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which [is] in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, [even] with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.
\[20]And the sticks on which thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes.
\[21]And say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:
\[22]And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:
\[23]Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
\[24]And David my servant [shall be] king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.
\[25]And they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, in which your fathers have dwelt, and they shall dwell in it, [even] they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant David [shall be] their prince for ever.
\[26]Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.
\[27]My tabernacle also shall be with them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
\[28]And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever.

\[2]Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him.
\[3]And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I [am] against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:
\[4]And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thy army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts [of armor], [even] a great company [with] bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:
\[5]Persia, Cush, and Phut with them; all of them with shield and helmet:
\[6]Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: [and] many people with thee.
\[7]Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled to thee, and be thou a guard to them.
\[8]After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land [that is] brought back from the sword, [and is] gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall all dwell in safety.
\[9]Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee.
\[10]Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, [that] at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought:
\[11]And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,
\[12]To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thy hand upon the desolate places [that are now] inhabited, and upon the people [that are] gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.
\[13]Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all its young lions, shall say to thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?
\[14]Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know [it]?
\[15]And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army:
\[16]And thou shalt come against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.
\[17]Thus saith the Lord GOD; [Art] thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days [many] years, that I would bring thee against them?
\[18]And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, [that] my fury shall come up in my face.
\[19]For in my jealousy [and] in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel.
\[20]So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping animals that creep upon the earth, and all the men that [are] upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be overturned, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.
\[21]And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man's sword shall be against his brother.
\[22]And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that [are] with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.
\[23]Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

herefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [am] against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:
\[2]And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel:
\[3]And I will strike thy bow out of thy left hand, and I will cause thy arrows to fall from thy right hand.
\[4]Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy bands, and the people that [are] with thee: I will give thee to the ravenous birds of every sort, and [to] the beasts of the field to be devoured.
\[5]Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken [it], saith the Lord GOD.
\[6]And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.
\[7]So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not [let them] profane my holy name any more: and the heathen shall know that I [am] the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.
\[8]Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this [is] the day of which I have spoken.
\[9]And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaffs, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:
\[10]So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down [any] out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall lay waste those that wasted them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord GOD.
\[11]And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] I will give to Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the [noses] of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call [it] The valley of Hamon-gog.
\[12]And seven months shall the house of Israel be in burying them, that they may cleanse the land.
\[13]Yes, all the people of the land shall bury [them]: and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord GOD.
\[14]And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.
\[15]And [as] passengers pass through the land, when [any] seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.
\[16]And also the name of the city [shall be] Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land.
\[17]And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak to every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, [even] a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood.
\[18]Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
\[19]And ye shall eat fat till ye are full, and drink blood till ye are drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
\[20]Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD.
\[21]And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.
\[22]So the house of Israel shall know that I [am] the LORD their God from that day and forward.
\[23]And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore I hid my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so they all fell by the sword.
\[24]According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done to them, and hid my face from them.
\[25]Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;
\[26]After they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made [them] afraid.
\[27]When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of the lands of their enemies, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;
\[28]Then shall they know that I [am] the LORD their God, who caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them to their own land, and have left none of them there any more.
\[29]Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.

n the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth [day] of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was smitten, in the same day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me thither.
\[2]In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which [was] as the frame of a city on the south.
\[3]And he brought me thither, and behold, [there was] a man, whose appearance [was] like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.
\[4]And the man said to me, Son of man, behold with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for, to the intent that I might show [them] to thee [art] thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.
\[5]And behold a wall on the outside of the house around, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits [long] by the cubit and a hand-breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed: and the hight, one reed.
\[6]Then he came to the gate which looketh towards the east, and ascended its stairs, and measured the threshhold of the gate, [which was] one reed broad; and the other threshhold [of the gate], [which was] one reed broad.
\[7]And [every] little chamber [was] one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers [were] five cubits; and the threshhold of the gate by the porch of the gate within [was] one reed.
\[8]He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.
\[9]Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate [was] inward.
\[10]And the little chambers of the gate eastward [were] three on this side, and three on that side; they three [were] of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.
\[11]And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; [and] the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
\[12]The space also before the little chambers [was] one cubit [on this side], and the space [was] one cubit on that side: and the little chambers [were] six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
\[13]He measured then the gate from the roof of [one] little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth [was] five and twenty cubits, door against door.
\[14]He made also posts of sixty cubits; even to the post of the court around the gate.
\[15]And from the face of the gate of the entrance to the face of the porch of the inner gate [were] fifty cubits.
\[16]And [there were] narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate around, and likewise to the arches: and windows [were] around inward: and upon [each] post [were] palm-trees.
\[17]Then he brought me into the outward court, and lo, [there were] chambers, and a pavement made for the court around: thirty chambers [were] upon the pavement.
\[18]And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates [was] the lower pavement.
\[19]Then he measured the breadth from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court without, a hundred cubits eastward and northward.
\[20]And the gate of the outward court that looked towards the north, he measured its length, and its breadth.
\[21]And the little chambers of it [were] three on this side and three on that side; and its posts and its arches were after the measure of the first gate; its length [was] fifty cubits, and its breadth five and twenty cubits.
\[22]And their windows, and their arches, and their palm-trees, [were] after the measure of the gate that looketh towards the east; and they went up to it by seven steps; and its arches [were] before them.
\[23]And the gate of the inner court [was] over against the gate towards the north, and towards the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.
\[24]After that he brought me towards the south, and behold a gate towards the south: and he measured its posts and its arches according to these measures.
\[25]And [there were] windows in it and in its arches around, like those windows: the length [was] fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
\[26]And [there were] seven steps to go up to it, and its arches [were] before them: and it had palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon its posts.
\[27]And [there was] a gate in the inner court towards the south: and he measured from gate to gate towards the south a hundred cubits.
\[28]And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate; and he measured the south gate according to these measures;
\[29]And its little chambers, and its posts, and its arches, according to these measures; and [there were] windows in it and in its arches around: [it was] fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
\[30]And the arches around [were] five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.
\[31]And its arches [were] towards the outer court; and palm-trees [were] upon its posts: and the ascent to it [had] eight steps.
\[32]And he brought me into the inner court towards the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures.
\[33]And its little chambers, and its posts, and its arches, [were] according to these measures; and [there were] windows in it and in its arches around: [it was] fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
\[34]And its arches [were] towards the outward court; and palm-trees were upon its posts, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it [had] eight steps.
\[35]And he brought me to the north gate, and measured [it] according to these measures;
\[36]Its little chambers, its posts, and its arches, and the windows to it around: the length [was] fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
\[37]And its posts [were] towards the outer court; and palm-trees [were] upon its posts, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it [had] eight steps.
\[38]And the chambers and its entries [were] by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt-offering.
\[39]And in the porch of the gate [were] two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay upon it the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.
\[40]And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, [were] two tables; and on the other side, which [was] at the porch of the gate, [were] two tables.
\[41]Four tables [were] on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, upon which they slew [their sacrifices].
\[42]And the four tables [were] of hewn stone for the burnt-offering, of a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high: upon which also they laid the instruments with which they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.
\[43]And within [were] hooks, a hand broad, fastened around: and upon the tables [was] the flesh of the offering.
\[44]And without the inner gate [were] the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which [was] at the side of the north gate; and their prospect [was] towards the south: one at the side of the east gate [having] the prospect towards the north.
\[45]And he said to me, This chamber, whose prospect [is] towards the south, [is] for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.
\[46]And the chamber whose prospect [is] towards the north [is] for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these [are] the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, who come near to the LORD to minister to him.
\[47]So he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar [that was] before the house.
\[48]And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured [each] post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate [was] three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
\[49]The length of the porch [was] twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and [he brought me] by the steps by which they went up to it: and [there were] pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.

fterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, [which was] the breadth of the tabernacle.
\[2]And the breadth of the door [was] ten cubits; and the sides of the door [were] five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length of it forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.
\[3]Then he went inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.
\[4]So he measured the length of it twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said to me, This [is] the most holy [place].
\[5]Afterward he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of [every] side-chamber, four cubits, round the house on every side.
\[6]And the side-chambers [were] three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which [was] of the house for the side-chambers around, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.
\[7]And [there was] an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side-chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward around the house; therefore the breadth of the house [was still] upward, and so increased [from] the lowest [chamber] to the highest by the midst.
\[8]I saw also the hight of the house around: the foundations of the side-chambers [were] a full reed of six great cubits.
\[9]The thickness of the wall, which [was] for the side-chamber without, [was] five cubits: and [that] which [was] left [was] the place of the side-chambers that [were] within.
\[10]And between the chambers [was] the width of twenty cubits around the house on every side.
\[11]And the doors of the side-chambers [were] towards [the place that was] left, one door towards the north, and another door towards the south: and the breadth of the place that was left [was] five cubits around.
\[12]Now the building that was before the separate place at the end towards the west [was] seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building [was] five cubits thick around, and its length ninety cubits.
\[13]So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, a hundred cubits long;
\[14]Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place towards the east, a hundred cubits.
\[15]And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which [was] behind it, and its galleries on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;
\[16]The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries around on their three stories, over against the door, ceiled with wood around, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows [were] covered;

\[19]So that the face of a man [was] towards the palm-tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion towards the palm-tree on the other side: [it was] made through all the house around.

\[23]And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
\[24]And the doors had two leaves each, two turning leaves; two [leaves] for the one door, and two leaves for the other [door].
\[25]And [there were] made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, as [were] made upon the walls; and [there were] thick planks upon the face of the porch without.

\[2]Before the length of a hundred cubits [was] the north door, and the breadth [was] fifty cubits.
\[3]Over against the twenty [cubits] which [were] for the inner court, and over against the pavement which [was] for the outer court, [was] gallery against gallery in three [stories].
\[4]And before the chambers [was] a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors towards the north.
\[5]Now the upper chambers [were] shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.
\[6]For they [were] in three [stories], but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore [the building] was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.
\[7]And the wall that [was] without over against the chambers, towards the outer court on the forepart of the chambers, the length of it [was] fifty cubits.
\[8]For the length of the chambers that [were] in the outer court [was] fifty cubits: and lo, before the temple [were] a hundred cubits.
\[9]And from under these chambers [was] the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the outer court.
\[10]The chambers [were] in the thickness of the wall of the court towards the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.
\[11]And the way before them [was] like the appearance of the chambers which [were] towards the north, as long as they, [and] as broad as they: and all their goings out [were] both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
\[12]And according to the doors of the chambers that [were] towards the south [was] a door in the head of the way, [even] the way directly before the wall towards the east, as one entereth into them.
\[13]Then said he to me, The north chambers [and] the south chambers which [are] before the separate place, they [are] holy chambers, where the priests that approach to the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; for the place [is] holy.
\[14]When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy [place] into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments in which they minister; for they [are] holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to [those things] which [are] for the people.

\[16]He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed around.
\[17]He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed around.
\[18]He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.
\[19]He turned about to the west side, [and] measured five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.
\[20]He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall around, five hundred [reeds] long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.

\[2]And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice [was] like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.
\[3]And [it was] according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, [even] according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions [were] like the vision that I saw by the river Kebar; and I fell upon my face.
\[4]And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect [is] towards the east.
\[5]So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.
\[6]And I heard [him] speaking to me out of the house; and the man stood by me.
\[7]And he said to me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, [neither] they, nor their kings, by their lewd deeds, nor by the carcasses of their kings in their high places.
\[8]In their setting of their threshhold by my threshholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in my anger.
\[9]Now let them put away their lewd deeds, and the carcasses of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.
\[10]Thou son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.
\[11]And if they shall be ashamed of all that they have done, show them the form of the house, and the fashion of it, and its goings out, and its comings in, and all its forms, and all its ordinances, and all its forms, and all its laws: and write [it] in their sight, that they may keep the whole form of it, and all its ordinances, and do them.
\[12]This [is] the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain, the whole limit of it around [shall be] most holy. Behold, this [is] the law of the house.
\[13]And these [are] the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit [is] a cubit and a hand-breadth; even the bottom [shall be] a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border of it by its edge around [shall be] a span: and this [shall be] the higher place of the altar.
\[14]And from the bottom [upon] the ground [even] to the lower settle [shall be] two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle [even] to the greater settle [shall be] four cubits, and the breadth [one] cubit.
\[15]So the altar [shall be] four cubits; and from the altar and upward [shall be] four horns.
\[16]And the altar [shall be] twelve [cubits] long, twelve broad, square in the four squares of it.
\[17]And the settle [shall be] fourteen [cubits] long and fourteen broad in its four squares; and the border about it [shall be] half a cubit; and the bottom of it [shall be] a cubit about; and its stairs shall look towards the east.
\[18]And he said to me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These [are] the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt-offerings upon it, and to sprinkle blood upon it.
\[19]And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who approach to me, to minister to me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin-offering.
\[20]And thou shalt take of his blood, and put [it] on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border around: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.
\[21]Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin-offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.
\[22]And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed [it] with the bullock.
\[23]When thou hast made an end of cleansing [it], thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
\[24]And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them [for] a burnt-offering to the LORD.
\[25]Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat [for] a sin-offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.
\[26]Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.
\[27]And when these days have expired, it shall be, [that] upon the eighth day, and [so] forward, the priests shall make your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace-offerings: and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.

\[3][It is] for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of [that] gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.
\[4]Then he brought me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD: and I fell upon my face.
\[5]And the LORD said to me, Son of man mark well, and behold with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears all that I say to thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all its laws; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary;
\[6]And thou shalt say to the rebellious, [even] to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations;
\[7]In that ye have brought [into my sanctuary] strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, [even] my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.
\[8]And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
\[9]Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that [is] among the children of Israel.
\[10]And the Levites that have gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, who went astray from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.
\[11]Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, [having] charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.
\[12]Because they ministered to them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.
\[13]And they shall not come near to me, to do the office of a priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy [place]: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.
\[14]But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all its service, and for all that shall be done therein.
\[15]But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me, and they shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD:
\[16]They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my charge.
\[17]And it shall come to pass, [that] when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.
\[18]They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird [themselves] with any thing that causeth sweat.
\[19]And when they go forth into the outer court, [even] into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.
\[20]Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.
\[21]Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.
\[22]Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.
\[23]And they shall teach my people the [difference] between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.
\[24]And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; [and] they shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.
\[25]And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.
\[26]And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon to him seven days.
\[27]And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, to the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin-offering, saith the Lord GOD.
\[28]And it shall be to them for an inheritance: I [am] their inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I [am] their possession.
\[29]They shall eat the meat-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.
\[30]And the first of all the first-fruits of all [things], and every oblation of all, of every [sort] of your oblations, shall be the priest's: ye shall also give to the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thy house.

\[3]Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.
\[4]And the burnt-offering that the prince shall offer to the LORD in the sabbath day [shall be] six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.
\[5]And the meat-offering [shall be] an ephah for a ram, and the meat-offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
\[6]And in the day of the new moon [it shall be] a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish.
\[7]And he shall prepare a meat-offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall be able, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
\[8]And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of [that] gate, and he shall go forth by the way of it.
\[9]But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate by which he came in, but shall go forth over against it.
\[10]And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.
\[11]And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat-offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
\[12]Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt-offering or peace-offerings voluntarily to the LORD, [one] shall then open to him the gate that looketh towards the east, and he shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, as he did on the sabbath-day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth [one] shall shut the gate.
\[13]Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt-offering to the LORD [of] a lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning.
\[14]And thou shalt prepare a meat-offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat-offering continually by a perpetual ordinance to the LORD.
\[15]Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat-offering, and the oil, every morning [for] a continual burnt-offering.
\[16]Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince shall give a gift to any of his sons, the inheritance of it shall be to his sons; it [shall be] their possession by inheritance.
\[17]But if he shall give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; afterward it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be to his sons for them.
\[18]Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; [but] he shall give his sons' inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.

\[7]Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river [were] very many trees on the one side and on the other.

\[9]And it shall come to pass, [that] every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh.

\[11]But its miry places and its marshes shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.
\[12]And by the river upon its bank, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for food, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall its fruit be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to its months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and its fruit shall be for food, and its leaf for medicine.
\[13]Thus saith the Lord GOD; This [shall be] the border, by which ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph [shall have two] portions.
\[14]And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: [concerning] which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers: and this land shall fall to you for inheritance.
\[15]And this [shall be] the border of the land towards the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;
\[16]Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which [is] between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazar-hatticon, which [is] by the border of Hauran.
\[17]And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And [this is] the north side.
\[18]And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel [by] Jordan, from the border to the east sea. And [this is] the east side.
\[19]And the south side southward, from Tamar [even] to the waters of strife [in] Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And [this is] the south side southward.
\[20]The west side also [shall be] the great sea from the border, till a man cometh over against Hamath. This [is] the west side.
\[21]So shall ye divide this land to you according to the tribes of Israel.
\[22]And it shall come to pass, [that] ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be to you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.

\[9]The oblation that ye shall offer to the LORD [shall be] of five and twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in breadth.
\[10]And for them, [even] for the priests, shall be [this] holy oblation; towards the north five and twenty thousand [in length], and towards the west ten thousand in breadth, and towards the east ten thousand in breadth, and towards the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the midst of it.
\[11][It shall be] for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok; who have kept my charge, who went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.
\[12]And [this] oblation of the land that is offered shall be to them a thing most holy, by the border of the Levites.
\[13]And over against the border of the priests the Levites [shall have] five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length [shall be] five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.
\[14]And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the first-fruits of the land: for [it is] holy to the LORD.
\[15]And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane [place] for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs, and the city shall be in the midst of it.
\[16]And these [shall be] the measures of it; the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.
\[17]And the suburbs of the city shall be towards the north two hundred and fifty, and towards the south two hundred and fifty, and towards the east two hundred and fifty, and towards the west two hundred and fifty.
\[18]And the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy [portion shall be] ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy [portion]; and its increase shall be for food to them that serve the city.
\[19]And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel.
\[20]All the oblation [shall be] five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare, with the possession of the city.
\[21]And the residue [shall be] for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, over against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation towards the east border, and westward over against the five and twenty thousand towards the west border, over against the portions for the prince: and it shall be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the house [shall be] in the midst of it.
\[22]Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, [being] in the midst [of that] which is the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, shall be for the prince.
\[23]As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side to the west side, Benjamin [shall have] a [portion].
\[24]And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side, Simeon [shall have] a [portion].
\[25]And by the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side, Issachar a [portion].
\[26]And by the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side, Zebulun a [portion].
\[27]And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side, Gad a [portion].
\[28]And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar [to] the waters of strife [in] Kadesh, [and] to the river towards the great sea.
\[29]This [is] the land which ye shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these [are] their portions, saith the Lord GOD.
\[30]And these [are] the goings out of the city on the north side, four thousand and five hundred measures.
\[31]And the gates of the city [shall be] after the names of the tribes of Israel: three gates northward; one gate of Reuben, one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi.
\[32]And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three gates; one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate of Dan.
\[33]And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures: and three gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one gate of Zebulun.
\[34]And the west side four thousand and five hundred, [with] their three gates: one gate of Gad, one gate of Asher, one gate of Naphtali.
\[35]The circuit [was] eighteen thousand [measures]: and the name of the city from [that] day [shall be], The LORD [is] there.

n the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.
\[2]And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.
\[3]And the king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring [certain] of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;
\[4]Children in whom [was] no blemish, but of good appearance, and skillful in all wisdom, and intelligent in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as [had] ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the language of the Chaldeans.
\[5]And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's food, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end of them they might stand before the king.
\[6]Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
\[7]To whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave to Daniel [the name] of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.
\[8]But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's food, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
\[9]Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.
\[10]And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your provision and your drink: for why should he see your faces more meager than the children who [are] of your sort? then will ye make [me] endanger my head to the king.
\[11]Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
\[12]Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.
\[13]Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenances of the children that eat of the portion of the king's provision: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.
\[14]So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
\[15]And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children who ate the portion of the king's provision.
\[16]Thus Melzar took away the portion of their food, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.
\[17]As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
\[18]Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
\[19]And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore they stood before the king.
\[20]And in all matters of wisdom [and] understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times superior to all the magicians [and] astrologers that [were] in all his realm.
\[21]And Daniel continued [even] to the first year of king Cyrus.

nd in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, with which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep broke from him.
\[2]Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to show the king his dream. So they came and stood before the king.
\[3]And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.
\[4]Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Syriac, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.
\[5]The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known to me the dream, with the interpretation of it, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.
\[6]But if ye shall show the dream, and the interpretation of it, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream, and the interpretation of it.
\[7]They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it.
\[8]The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.
\[9]But if ye will not make known to me the dream, [there is but] one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation of it.
\[10]The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king's matter: therefore [there is] no king, lord, nor ruler, [that] hath asked such things of any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.
\[11]And [it is] a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.
\[12]For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise [men] of Babylon.
\[13]And the decree went forth that the wise [men] should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.
\[14]Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, who had gone forth to slay the wise [men] of Babylon:
\[15]He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why [is] the decree [so] hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
\[16]Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation.
\[17]Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:
\[18]That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise [men] of Babylon.
\[19]Then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
\[20]Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:
\[21]And he changeth the times and the seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:
\[22]He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what [is] in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.
\[23]I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known to me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast [now] made known to us the king's matter.
\[24]Therefore Daniel went into Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise [men] of Babylon: he went and said thus to him; Destroy not the wise [men] of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.
\[25]Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus to him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known to the king the interpretation.
\[26]The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name [was] Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation of it?
\[27]Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded, the wise [men], the astrologers, the magicians, the sooth-sayers, cannot show to the king;
\[28]But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;
\[29]As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came [into thy mind] upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.
\[30]But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for [any] wisdom that I have more than any living, but for [their] sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.
\[31]Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness [was] excellent, stood before thee; and its form [was] terrible.
\[32]The head of this image [was] of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,
\[33]His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.
\[34]Thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet [that were] of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.
\[35]Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
\[36]This [is] the dream; and we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.
\[37]Thou, O king, [art] a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.
\[38]And wherever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou [art] this head of gold.
\[39]And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.
\[40]And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all [things]: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.
\[41]And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potter's clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with the miry clay.
\[42]And [as] the toes of the feet [were] part of iron, and part of clay, [so] the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.
\[43]And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.
\[44]And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, [but] it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
\[45]Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain, without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream [is] certain, and the interpretation of it sure.
\[46]Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors to him.
\[47]The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth [it is], that your God [is] a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldst reveal this secret.
\[48]Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise [men] of Babylon.
\[49]Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel [sat] in the gate of the king.

ebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose hight [was] sixty cubits, [and] the breadth of it six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
\[2]Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to convene the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sherifs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
\[3]Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sherifs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were assembled to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
\[4]Then a herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,
\[5][That] at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up.
\[6]And whoever shall not fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
\[7]Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down [and] worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
\[8]Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.
\[9]They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.
\[10]Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image:
\[11]And whoever shall not fall down and worship, [that] he shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
\[12]There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
\[13]Then Nebuchadnezzar in [his] rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.
\[14]Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said to them, [Is it] true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do ye not serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?
\[15]Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; [well]: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who [is] that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?
\[16]Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we [are] not careful to answer thee in this matter.
\[17]If it is [so], our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver [us] out of thy hand, O king.
\[18]But if not, be it known to thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
\[19]Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: [therefore] he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.
\[20]And he commanded the most mighty men that [were] in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, [and] to cast [them] into the burning fiery furnace.
\[21]Then these men were bound in their coats, their hose, and their hats, and their [other] garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
\[22]Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire killed those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.
\[23]And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
\[24]Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, [and] spoke, and said to his counselors, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king.
\[25]He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt: and the form of the fourth is like the son of God.
\[26]Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, [and] spoke, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come [hither]. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth from the midst of the fire.
\[27]And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counselors, being assembled, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was a hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor had the smell of fire passed upon them.
\[28][Then] Nebuchadnezzar spoke, and said, Blessed [be] the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
\[29]Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort.
\[30]Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.

ebuchadnezzar the king, to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.
\[2]I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought towards me.
\[3]How great [are] his signs! and how mighty [are] his wonders! his kingdom [is] an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion [is] from generation to generation.
\[4]I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace:
\[5]I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
\[6]Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise [men] of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
\[7]Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the sooth-sayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me the interpretation of it.
\[8]But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name [is] Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom [is] the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, [saying],
\[9]O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods [is] in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation of it.
\[10]Thus [were] the visions of my head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and its hight [was] great.
\[11]The tree grew, and was strong, and its hight reached to heaven, and the sight of it to the end of all the earth:
\[12]Its leaves [were] fair, and its fruit abundant, and in it [was] food for all: the beasts of the field had shade under it, and the fowls of heaven dwelt among its boughs, and all flesh was fed from it.
\[13]I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven;
\[14]He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts escape from under it, and the fowls from its branches.
\[15]Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and [let] its portion [be] with the beasts in the grass of the earth.
\[16]Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given to him; and let seven times pass over him.
\[17]This matter [is] by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.
\[18]This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation of it, forasmuch as all the wise [men] of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation: but thou [art] able; for the spirit of the holy gods [is] in thee.
\[19]Then Daniel, whose name [was] Belteshazzar, was astonished for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation of it, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered, and said, My lord, the dream [be] to them that hate thee, and the interpretation of it to thy enemies.
\[20]The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose hight reached to the heaven, and the sight of it to all the earth;
\[21]Whose leaves [were] fair, and the fruit of it abundant, and in it [was] food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of heaven had their habitation:
\[22]It [is] thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth to heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.
\[23]And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and [let] its portion [be] with the beasts of the field, till seven times shall pass over him;
\[24]This [is] the interpretation, O king, and this [is] the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:
\[25]That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou shalt know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
\[26]And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure to thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.
\[27]Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thy iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.
\[28]All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
\[29]At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.
\[30]The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?
\[31]While the word [was] in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, [saying], O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom hath departed from thee.
\[32]And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling [shall be] with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou shalt know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
\[33]The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' [feathers], and his nails like birds' [claws].
\[34]And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honored him that liveth for ever, whose dominion [is] an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom [is] from generation to generation:
\[35]And all the inhabitants of the earth [are] reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and [among] the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say to him, What doest thou?
\[36]At the same time my reason returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honor and brightness returned to me; and my counselors and my lords sought to me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me.
\[37]Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, all whose works [are] truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.

elshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.
\[2]Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which [was] in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink in them.

\[4]They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
\[5]In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
\[6]Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.
\[7]The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the sooth-sayers. [And] the king spoke and said to the wise [men] of Babylon, Whoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation of it, shall be clothed with scarlet, and [have] a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\[8]Then came in all the king's wise [men]: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation of it.
\[9]Then was the king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonished.
\[10][Now] the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: [and] the queen spoke and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:
\[11]There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom [is] the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, [I say], thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, [and] sooth-sayers;
\[12]Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, the interpreting of dreams, and showing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.
\[13]Then was Daniel brought in before the king. [And] the king spoke and said to Daniel, [Art] thou that Daniel, who [art] of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judea?
\[14]I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods [is] in thee, and [that] light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.
\[15]And now the wise [men], the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known to me the interpretation of it, but they could not show the interpretation of the thing:
\[16]And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation of it, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and [have] a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\[17]Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
\[18]O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honor:
\[19]And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.
\[20]But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:
\[21]And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling [was] with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruleth in the kingdom of men, and [that] he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.
\[22]And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this;
\[23]But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drank wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath [is], and whose [are] all thy ways, thou hast not glorified.
\[24]Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.
\[25]And this [is] the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
\[26]This [is] the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.
\[27]TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
\[28]PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
\[29]Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and [put] a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\[30]In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.
\[31]And Darius the Median took the kingdom, [being] about sixty and two years old.

t pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty princes, who should be over the whole kingdom;
\[2]And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel [was] first: that the princes might give accounts to them, and the king should have no damage.
\[3]Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit [was] in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
\[4]Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he [was] faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.
\[5]Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find [it] against him concerning the law of his God.
\[6]Then these presidents and princes assembled to the king, and said thus to him, King Darius, live for ever.
\[7]All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counselors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
\[8]Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
\[9]Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.
\[10]Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber towards Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did before.
\[11]Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.
\[12]Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask [a petition] of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing [is] true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
\[13]Then they answered and said before the king, That Daniel, who [is] of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.
\[14]Then the king, when he heard [these] words, was much displeased with himself, and set [his] heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he labored till the setting of the sun to deliver him.
\[15]Then these men assembled to the king, and said to the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians [is], That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.
\[16]Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast [him] into the den of lions. [Now] the king spoke and said to Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.
\[17]And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.
\[18]Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep went from him.
\[19]Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions.
\[20]And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice to Daniel: [and] the king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?
\[21]Then said Daniel to the king, O king, live for ever.
\[22]My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocence was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.
\[23]Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel out of the den. So Daniel was taken out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.
\[24]And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast [them] into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces before they came to the bottom of the den.
\[25]Then king Darius wrote to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.
\[26]I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he [is] the living God, and steadfast for ever, and his kingdom [that] which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion [shall be even] to the end.
\[27]He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
\[28]So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

n the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, [and] told the sum of the matters.
\[2]Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven strove upon the great sea.
\[3]And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
\[4]The first [was] like a lion, and had eagles' wings: I beheld till its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.
\[5]And behold another beast, a second, like a bear, and it raised itself on one side, and [it had] three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh.
\[6]After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
\[7]After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it [was] diverse from all the beasts that [were] before it; and it had ten horns.
\[8]I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and behold, in this horn [were] eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.
\[9]I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment [was] white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne [was like] the fiery flame, [and] his wheels [as] burning fire.
\[10]A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set and the books were opened.
\[11]I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke: I beheld [even] till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.
\[12]As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.
\[13]I saw in the night visions, and behold, [one] like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
\[14]And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion [is] an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom [that] which shall not be destroyed.
\[15]I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of [my] body, and the visions of my head troubled me.
\[16]I came near to one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.
\[17]These great beasts, which are four, [are] four kings, [which] shall arise out of the earth.
\[18]But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
\[19]Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth [were of] iron, and his nails [of] brass; [which] devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;
\[20]And of the ten horns that [were] in his head, and [of] the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even [of] that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke very great things, whose look [was] more stout than his fellows.
\[21]I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
\[22]Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
\[23]Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
\[24]And the ten horns out of this kingdom [are] ten kings [that] shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.
\[25]And he shall speak [great] words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.
\[26]But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion to consume and to destroy [it] to the end.
\[27]And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom [is] an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
\[28]Hitherto [is] the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.

n the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, [even to] me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.
\[2]And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I [was] at Shushan [in] the palace, which [is] in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river Ulai.
\[3]Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had [two] horns: and the [two] horns [were] high; but one [was] higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
\[4]I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither [was there any] that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.
\[5]And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat [had] a notable horn between his eyes.
\[6]And he came to the ram that had [two] horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran to him in the fury of his power.
\[7]And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
\[8]Therefore the he-goat became very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and in its stead came up four notable ones towards the four winds of heaven.
\[9]And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which became exceeding great, towards the south, and towards the east, and towards the pleasant [land].
\[10]And it grew great, [even] to the host of heaven; and it cast down [some] of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.
\[11]Yes, he magnified [himself] even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily [sacrifice] was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
\[12]And a host was given [him] against the daily [sacrifice] by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practiced, and prospered.
\[13]Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said to that certain [saint] who spoke, How long [shall be] the vision [concerning] the daily [sacrifice], and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
\[14]And he said to me, Until two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
\[15]And it came to pass, when I, [even] I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.
\[16]And I heard a man's voice between [the banks of] Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this [man] to understand the vision.
\[17]So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end [shall be] the vision.
\[18]Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face towards the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.
\[19]And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end [shall be].
\[20]The ram which thou sawest having [two] horns [are] the kings of Media and Persia.
\[21]And the rough goat [is] the king of Grecia: and the great horn that [is] between his eyes [is] the first king.
\[22]Now that being broken, whereas four stood up in its place, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.
\[23]And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.
\[24]And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practice, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.
\[25]And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify [himself] in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
\[26]And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told [is] true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it [shall be] for many days.
\[27]And I Daniel fainted, and was sick [certain] days; afterward I rose, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood [it].

n the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;
\[2]In the first year of his reign, I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, concerning which the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.
\[3]And I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:
\[4]And I prayed to the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;
\[5]We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:
\[6]Neither have we hearkened to thy servants the prophets, who spoke in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
\[7]O Lord, righteousness [belongeth] to thee, but to us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, [that are] near, and [that are] far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.
\[8]O Lord, to us [belongeth] confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
\[9]To the Lord our God [belong] mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;
\[10]Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
\[11]And all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that [is] written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.
\[12]And he hath confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven it hath not been done as it hath been done upon Jerusalem.
\[13]As [it is] written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet we have not made our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.
\[14]Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God [is] righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we have not obeyed his voice.
\[15]And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast obtained thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
\[16]O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thy anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people [have become] a reproach to all [that are] about us.
\[17]Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.
\[18]O my God, incline thy ear, and hear; open thy eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.
\[19]O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thy own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.
\[20]And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin, and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;
\[21]Yes, while I [was] speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.
\[22]And he informed [me], and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.
\[23]At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to show [thee]; for thou [art] greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.
\[24]Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.
\[25]Know therefore and understand, [that] from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Messiah the Prince [shall be] seven weeks, and sixty and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.
\[26]And after sixty and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and its end [shall be] with a flood, and to the end of the war desolations are determined.
\[27]And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations, he shall make [it] desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

n the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing [was] true, but the time appointed [was] long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.
\[2]In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.
\[3]I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.
\[4]And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which [is] Hiddekel;
\[5]Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins [were] girded with fine gold of Uphaz:
\[6]His body also [was] like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.
\[7]And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision: but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.
\[8]Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.
\[9]Yet I heard the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then I was in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.
\[10]And behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and [upon] the palms of my hands.
\[11]And he said to me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to thee, and stand upright: for to thee I am now sent. And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling.
\[12]Then said he to me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.
\[13]But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.
\[14]Now I have come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision [is] for many days.
\[15]And when he had spoken such words to me, I set my face towards the ground, and I became dumb.
\[16]And behold, [one] like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.
\[17]For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, immediately there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.
\[18]Then there came again and touched me [one] like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,
\[19]And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace [be] to thee, be strong, yes, be strong. And when he had spoken to me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.
\[20]Then said he, Knowest thou for what cause I come to thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.
\[21]But I will show thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and [there is] none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.

\[2]And now will I show thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than [they] all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.
\[3]And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.

\[10]But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and [one] shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, [even] to his fortress.
\[11]And the king of the south shall be moved with wrath, and shall come forth and fight with him, [even] with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.
\[12][And] when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down [many] ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened [by it].
\[13]For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.
\[14]And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.
\[15]So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fortified cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither [shall there be any] strength to withstand.
\[16]But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.
\[17]He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand [on his side], neither be for him.
\[18]After this shall he turn his face to the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause [it] to turn upon him.
\[19]Then he shall turn his face towards the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.
\[20]Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes [in] the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.
\[21]And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
\[22]And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflowed from before him, and shall be broken; yes, also the prince of the covenant.
\[23]And after the league [made] with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.
\[24]He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do [that] which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: [yes], and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.
\[25]And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.
\[26]Yes, they that feed of the portion of his provisions shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.
\[27]And both these kings hearts [shall be] to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end [shall be] at the time appointed.
\[28]Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart [shall be] against the holy covenant; and he shall do [exploits], and return to his own land.
\[29]At the time appointed he shall return, and come towards the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.
\[30]For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.
\[31]And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily [sacrifice], and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.
\[32]And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that know their God shall be strong, and do [exploits].
\[33]And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, [many] days.
\[34]Now when they shall fall, they shall be assisted with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.
\[35]And [some] of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make [them] white, [even] to the time of the end: because [it is] yet for a time appointed.
\[36]And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that which is determined shall be done.
\[37]Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.
\[38]But in his estate shall he honor the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.
\[39]Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge [and] increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.
\[40]And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.
\[41]He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many [countries] shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, [even] Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.
\[42]He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
\[43]But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Cushites [shall be] at his steps.
\[44]But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.
\[45]And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain: yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.

he word of the LORD that came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
\[2]The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go take to thee a wife addicted to lewdness and children of lewdness; for the land hath committed great lewdness, [departing] from the LORD.
\[3]So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; who conceived, and bore him a son.
\[4]And the LORD said to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little [while], and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.
\[5]And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
\[6]And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And [God] said to him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.
\[7]But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.
\[8]Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son.
\[9]Then said [God], Call his name Lo-ammi: for ye [are] not my people, and I will not be your [God].
\[10]Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, [that] in the place where it was said to them, Ye [are] not my people, [there] it shall be said to them, [Ye are] the sons of the living God.

\[2]Plead with your mother, plead: for she [is] not my wife, neither [am] I her husband: let her therefore put away her prostitutions out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;
\[3]Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and kill her with thirst.
\[4]And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they [are] the children of lewdness.
\[5]For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give [me] my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.
\[6]Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.
\[7]And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find [them]: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then [was it] better with me than now.
\[8]For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, [which] they prepared for Baal.
\[9]Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in its time, and my wine in its season, and I will recover my wool and my flax [given] to cover her nakedness.
\[10]And now will I disclose her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.
\[11]I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.
\[12]And I will destroy her vines and her fig-trees, of which she hath said, These [are] my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
\[13]And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, in which she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her ear-rings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgot me, saith the LORD.
\[14]Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably to her.
\[15]And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came from the land of Egypt.
\[16]And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, [that] thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.
\[17]For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.
\[18]And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and [with] the creeping animals of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down in safety.
\[19]And I will betroth thee to me for ever; yes, I will betroth thee to me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies.
\[20]I will even betroth thee to me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.
\[21]And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;
\[22]And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.
\[23]And I will sow her to me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to [them who were] not my people, Thou [art] my people; and they shall say, [Thou art] my God.

\[3]Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth in it shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yes, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.

\[5]Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.
\[6]My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.
\[7]As they were increased, so they sinned against me: [therefore] will I change their glory into shame.
\[8]They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.
\[9]And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.
\[10]For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall be guilty of lewdness, and shall not increase: because they have ceased to take heed to the LORD.
\[11]Lewdness and wine and new wine take away the heart.
\[12]My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth to them: for the spirit of lewdness hath caused [them] to err, and they have gone astray from under their God.
\[13]They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shade of them is agreeable: therefore your daughters shall be guilty of lewdness, and your spouses shall commit adultery.
\[14]I will not punish your daughters when they are guilty of lewdness, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for they themselves are separated with prostitutes, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people [that] doth not understand shall fall.
\[15]Though thou, Israel, playest the harlot, [yet] let not Judah offend; and come not ye to Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.

\[9]O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.
\[10][It is] in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.
\[11]And Ephraim [is as] a heifer [that is] taught, [and] loveth to tread out [the corn]; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, [and] Jacob shall break his clods.
\[12]Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for [it is] time to seek the LORD, till he shall come and reign righteousness upon you.
\[13]Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou hast trusted in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.
\[14]Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be plundered, as Shalman plundered Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon [her] children.
\[15]So shall Beth-el do to you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off.

\[3]Tell ye your children of it, and [let] your children [tell] their children, and their children another generation.

\[5]Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.
\[6]For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth [are] the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.
\[7]He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig-tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast [it] away; its branches are made white.
\[8]Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
\[9]The meat-offering and the drink-offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD'S ministers, mourn.
\[10]The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted; the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.
\[11]Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vine-dressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field hath perished.
\[12]The vine is dried up, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, [even] all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.
\[13]Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat-offering and the drink-offering is withheld from the house of your God.
\[14]Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders [and] all the inhabitants of the land [into] the house of the LORD your God, and cry to the LORD,
\[15]Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD [is] at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.
\[16]Is not the food cut off before our eyes, [and] joy and gladness from the house of our God?
\[17]The seed hath perished under their clods, the granaries are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.
\[18]How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
\[19]O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.

\[2]A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, [even] to the years of many generations.
\[3]A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land [is] as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; and nothing shall escape them.

\[5]Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.
\[6]Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.
\[7]They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks:
\[8]Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and [when] they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.

\[11]And the LORD will utter his voice before his army: for his camp [is] very great: for [he is] strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD [is] great and very terrible; and who can abide it?
\[12]Therefore also now, saith the LORD, Turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:
\[13]And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn to the LORD your God: for he [is] gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth of the evil.
\[14]Who knoweth [if] he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; [even] a meat-offering and a drink-offering to the LORD your God?
\[15]Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:
\[16]Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.
\[17]Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: why should they say among the people, Where [is] their God?
\[18]Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people.
\[19]And the LORD will answer and say to his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied with it; and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen:
\[20]But I will remove far from you the northern [army], and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face towards the east sea, and his hinder part towards the utmost sea, and his odious scent shall come up, and his ill savor shall come up, because he hath done great things.
\[21]Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things.
\[22]Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.
\[23]Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first [month].
\[24]And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.
\[25]And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you.
\[26]And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.
\[27]And ye shall know that I [am] in the midst of Israel, and [that] I [am] the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.
\[28]And it shall come to pass afterward, [that] I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:
\[29]And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.
\[30]And I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
\[31]The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD shall come.

\[12]Let the heathen be awakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen on every side.

\[17]So shall ye know that I [am] the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.
\[18]And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth from the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.
\[19]Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence [against] the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.

ear ye this word which I take up against you, [even] a lamentation, O house of Israel.
\[2]The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise! she is forsaken upon her land; [there is] none to raise her up.
\[3]For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out [by] a thousand shall leave a hundred, and that which went forth [by] a hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.
\[4]For thus saith the LORD to the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:
\[5]But seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to naught.
\[6]Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour [it], and [there be] none to quench [it] in Beth-el.
\[7]Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness on the earth,
\[8][Seek him] that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shades of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: JEHOVAH [is] his name:
\[9]That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.
\[10]They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.
\[11]Forasmuch therefore as your treading [is] upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.
\[12]For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate [from their right].
\[13]Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it [is] an evil time.
\[14]Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.
\[15]Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.
\[16]Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing [shall be] in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skillful in lamentation to wailing.
\[17]And in all vineyards [shall be] wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.
\[18]Woe to you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end [is] it for you? the day of the LORD [is] darkness, and not light.
\[19]As if a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.
\[20][Shall] not the day of the LORD [be] darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?
\[21]I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.
\[22]Though ye offer me burnt-offerings and your meat-offerings, I will not accept [them]; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat beasts.
\[23]Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.
\[24]But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
\[25]Have ye offered to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?
\[26]But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.
\[27]Therefore I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name [is] The God of hosts.

\[2]Pass ye to Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: [are they] better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?
\[3]Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;

\[6]That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.
\[7]Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.
\[8]The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellence of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore I will deliver up the city with all its abundance.
\[9]And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, they shall die.
\[10]And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring the bones out of the house, and shall say to him that [is] by the sides of the house, [Is there] yet [any] with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.
\[11]For behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.
\[12]Shall horses run upon the rock? will [one] plow [there] with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:
\[13]Ye who rejoice in a thing of naught, who say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?

\[3]The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.
\[4]Thus hath the Lord GOD shown to me: and behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.
\[5]Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he [is] small.
\[6]The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.
\[7]Thus he showed me: and behold, the Lord stood upon a wall [made] by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.
\[8]And the LORD said to me, Amos, what seest thou? and I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:
\[9]And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
\[10]Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.
\[11]For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.
\[12]Also Amaziah said to Amos, O thou seer, go flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:
\[13]But prophesy not again any more at Beth-el: for it [is] the king's chapel, and it [is] the king's court.
\[14]Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I [was] no prophet, neither [was] I a prophet's son; but I [was] a herdman, and a gatherer of sycamore fruit:
\[15]And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said to me, Go, prophesy to my people Israel.
\[16]Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not [thy word] against the house of Isaac.
\[17]Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go from his land into captivity.

\[2]And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the LORD to me, The end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.
\[3]And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord GOD: [there shall be] many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast [them] forth with silence.
\[4]Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,
\[5]Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?
\[6]That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; and even sell the refuse of the wheat?
\[7]The LORD hath sworn by the excellence of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.
\[8]Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth in it? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood: and it shall be cast out and drowned, as [by] the flood of Egypt.

\[11]Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:
\[12]And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find [it].
\[13]In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.

\[3]The pride of thy heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation [is] high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?
\[4]Though thou shalt exalt [thyself] as the eagle, and though thou shalt set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.
\[5]If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave [some] grapes?
\[6]How are [the things] of Esau searched out! [how] are his hidden things sought!
\[7]All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee [even] to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, [and] prevailed against thee; [they that eat] thy bread have laid a wound under thee: [there is] no understanding in him.
\[8]Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise [men] out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?
\[9]And thy mighty [men], O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.
\[10]For [thy] violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.
\[11]In the day that thou stoodst on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou [wast] as one of them.
\[12]But thou shouldst not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldst thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldst thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.
\[13]Thou shouldst not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yes, thou shouldst not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid [hands] on their substance in the day of their calamity;
\[14]Neither shouldst thou have stood in the cross-way, to cut off those of his that escaped; neither shouldst thou have delivered up those of his that remained in the day of distress.
\[15]For the day of the LORD [is] near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done to thee: thy reward shall return upon thy own head.
\[16]For as ye have drank upon my holy mountain, [so] shall all the heathen drink continually, yes, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.
\[17]But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.
\[18]And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be [any] remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken [it].
\[19]And [they of] the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and [they of] the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin [shall possess] Gilead.
\[20]And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel [shall possess] that of the Canaanites, [even] to Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which [is] in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south.

ow the word of the LORD came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,
\[2]Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.
\[3]But Jonah arose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare of it, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.
\[4]But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was in danger of being broken.
\[5]Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man to his god, and cast the wares that [were] in the ship into the sea, to lighten [it] of them. But Jonah had gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.
\[6]So the ship-master came to him, and said to him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, it may be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.
\[7]And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil [is] upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.
\[8]Then said they to him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil [is] upon us; What [is] thy occupation? and whence comest thou? what [is] thy country? and of what people [art] thou?
\[9]And he said to them, I [am] a Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry [land].
\[10]Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said to him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.
\[11]Then said they to him, What shall we do to thee, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.
\[12]And he said to them, Take me, and cast me into the sea; so shall the sea be calm to you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest [is] upon you.
\[13]Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring [it] to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.
\[14]Wherefore they cried to the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee.
\[15]So they took Jonah, and cast him into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.

\[4]Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again towards thy holy temple.

\[2]Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from them, and their flesh from off their bones;
\[3]Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
\[4]Then shall they cry to the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.
\[5]Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him:
\[6]Therefore night [shall be] to you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark to you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.
\[7]Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yes, they shall all cover their lips; for [there is] no answer of God.
\[8]But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.
\[9]Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.
\[10]They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
\[11]Her heads judge for reward, and her priests teach for hire, and her prophets divine for money; yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, [Is] not the LORD among us? no evil can come upon us.

\[9]Thy bow was made quite naked, [according] to the oaths of the tribes, [even thy] word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.

\[11]The sun [and] moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thy arrows they went, [and] at the shining of thy glittering spear.

\[13]Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, [even] for salvation with thy anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by uncovering the foundation to the neck. Selah.
\[14]Thou didst strike through with his staffs the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing [was] as to devour the poor secretly.
\[15]Thou didst walk through the sea with thy horses, [through] the mire of great waters.

he word of the LORD which came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.
\[2]I will utterly consume all [things] from off the land, saith the LORD.
\[3]I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling-blocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the LORD.
\[4]I will also stretch out my hand upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, [and] the name of the Chemarims with the priests;
\[5]And them that worship the host of heaven upon the house-tops; and them that worship [and] that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;
\[6]And them that have turned back from the LORD; and [those] that have not sought the LORD, nor inquired for him.
\[7]Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD [is] at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath invited his guests.
\[8]And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD'S sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel.
\[9]In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshhold, who fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.
\[10]And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, [that there shall be] the noise of a cry from the fish-gate, and a howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.
\[11]Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.
\[12]And it shall come to pass at that time, [that] I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.
\[13]Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit [them]; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine of them.
\[14]The great day of the LORD [is] near, [it is] near, and hasteth greatly, [even] the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.
\[15]That day [is] a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasting and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
\[16]A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fortified cities, and against the high towers.
\[17]And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.
\[18]Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD'S wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he will make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.

\[3]Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, who have performed his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye will be hid in the day of the LORD'S anger.
\[4]For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.
\[5]Woe to the inhabitants of the sea coasts, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD [is] against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.
\[6]And the sea coast shall be dwellings [and] cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks.
\[7]And the coasts shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed upon them: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God will visit them, and turn away their captivity.
\[8]I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, by which they have reproached my people, and magnified [themselves] against their border.
\[9]Therefore [as] I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, [even] the breeding of nettles, and salt-pits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall lay them waste, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.
\[10]This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified [themselves] against the people of the LORD of hosts.
\[11]The LORD [will be] terrible to them: for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and [men] shall worship him, every one from his place, [even] all the isles of the heathen.
\[12]Ye Cushites also, ye [shall be] slain by my sword.
\[13]And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, [and] dry like a wilderness.
\[14]And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; [their] voice shall sing in the windows; desolation [shall be] in the threshholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work.
\[15]This [is] the rejoicing city that dwelt in security, that said in her heart, I [am], and [there is] none besides me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, [and] wag his hand.

\[12]I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.

\[14]Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
\[15]The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thy enemy: the King of Israel, [even] the LORD, [is] in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.
\[16]In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: [and to] Zion, Let not thy hands be slack.
\[17]The LORD thy God in the midst of thee [is] mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.
\[18]I will gather [them that are] sorrowful for the solemn assembly, [who] are of thee, [to whom] the reproach of it [was] a burden.
\[19]Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.
\[20]At that time will I bring you [again], even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.

n the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,
\[2]Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD'S house should be built.
\[3]Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,
\[4][Is it] time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses, and this house [lie] waste?
\[5]Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.
\[6]Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe yourselves, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages [to put it] into a bag with holes.
\[7]Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.
\[8]Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD.
\[9]Ye looked for much, and lo, [it came] to little; and when ye brought [it] home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of my house that [is] waste, and ye run every man to his own house.
\[10]Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed [from] her fruit.
\[11]And I called for a drouth upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon [that] which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labor of the hands.
\[12]Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD.
\[13]Then spoke Haggai the LORD'S messenger in the LORD'S message to the people, saying, I [am] with you, saith the LORD.
\[14]And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and performed work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,

\[2]Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,
\[3]Who [is] left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? [is it] not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?
\[4]Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for I [am] with you, saith the LORD of hosts:
\[5][According to] the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.
\[6]For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it [is] a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry [land];
\[7]And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts.
\[8]The silver [is] mine, and the gold [is] mine, saith the LORD of hosts.
\[9]The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts.
\[10]In the four and twentieth [day] of the ninth [month], in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,
\[11]Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Ask now the priests [concerning] the law, saying,
\[12]If one shall bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt shall touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
\[13]Then said Haggai, If [one that is] unclean by a dead body shall touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.
\[14]Then answered Haggai, and said, So [is] this people, and so [is] this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so [is] every work of their hands; and that which they offer there [is] unclean.
\[15]And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:
\[16]Since those [days] were, when [one] came to a heap of twenty [measures], there were [but] ten: when [one] came to the press-vat to draw out fifty [vessels] out of the press, there were [but] twenty.
\[17]I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labors of your hands; yet ye [turned] not to me, saith the LORD.
\[18]Consider now from this day, and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth [month], [even] from the day that the foundation of the LORD'S temple was laid, consider [it].
\[19]Is the seed yet in the barn? yes, as yet the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless [you].
\[20]And again the word of the LORD came to Haggai in the four and twentieth [day] of the month, saying,
\[21]Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;
\[22]And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen: and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.
\[23]In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.

\[6]But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, As the LORD of hosts thought to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.
\[7]Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which [is] the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,
\[8]I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that [were] in the bottom; and behind him [were there] red horses, speckled, and white.
\[9]Then said I, O my lord, what [are these]? And the angel that talked with me said to me, I will show thee what these [are].
\[10]And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These [are they] whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.
\[11]And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.
\[12]Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these seventy years.
\[13]And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me [with] good words [and] comforting words.
\[14]So the angel that communed with me said to me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.
\[15]And I am very greatly displeased with the heathen [that are] at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.
\[16]Therefore thus saith the LORD; I have returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.
\[17]Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
\[18]Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.
\[19]And I said to the angel that talked with me, What [are] these? And he answered me, These [are] the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
\[20]And the LORD showed me four carpenters.
\[21]Then said I, What come these to do? And he spoke, saying, These [are] the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head: but these are come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted [their] horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.

\[8]For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me to the nations which wasted you: for he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye.

\[8]And the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,
\[9]Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassions every man to his brother:
\[10]And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.
\[11]But they refused to hearken, and withdrew the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.
\[12]Yes, they made their hearts [as] an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.
\[13]Therefore it is come to pass, [that] as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:
\[14]But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.

gain the word of the LORD of hosts came [to me], saying,
\[2]Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.
\[3]Thus saith the LORD; I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.
\[4]Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.
\[5]And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.
\[6]Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvelous in my eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.
\[7]Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;
\[8]And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.
\[9]Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, who [were] in the day [when] the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.
\[10]For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither [was there any] peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbor.
\[11]But now I [will] not [be] to the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts.
\[12]For the seed [shall be] prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these [things].
\[13]And it shall come to pass, [that] as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, let your hands be strong.
\[14]For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not;
\[15]So again have I thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.
\[16]These [are] the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbor; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates:
\[17]And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbor; and love no false oath: for all these [are things] that I hate, saith the LORD.
\[18]And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
\[19]Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth [month], and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace.
\[20]Thus saith the LORD of hosts: [It shall] yet [come to pass], that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:
\[21]And the inhabitants of one [city] shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I will go also.
\[22]And many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.
\[23]Thus saith the LORD of hosts: In those days [it shall come to pass], that ten men out of all languages of the nations, shall take hold, shall even take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard [that] God [is] with you.

\[14]Then I cut asunder my other staff, [even] Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
\[15]And the LORD said to me, Take to thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.
\[16]For lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, [who] shall not visit those that are cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.

\[5]And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.

\[7]Ye offer polluted bread upon my altar? and ye say, In what have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD [is] contemptible.
\[8]And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, [is it] not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, [is it] not evil? offer it now to thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.
\[9]And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious to us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your person? saith the LORD of hosts.

\[6]The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and turned many away from iniquity.

\[10]Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?
\[11]Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD whom he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.
\[12]The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering to the LORD of hosts.
\[13]And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth [it] with good will at your hand.
\[14]Yet ye say, Why? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet [is] she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.
\[15]And did he not make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And why one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
\[16]For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith, that he hateth putting away: for [one] covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.
\[17]Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, In what have we wearied [him]? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil [is] good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where [is] the God of judgment?

\[16]Then they that feared the LORD spoke often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard [it], and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.
\[17]And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.

or behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
\[2]But to you that fear my name, shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.
\[3]And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do [this], saith the LORD of hosts.
\[4]Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel, [with] the statutes and judgments.
\[5]Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:
\[6]And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
